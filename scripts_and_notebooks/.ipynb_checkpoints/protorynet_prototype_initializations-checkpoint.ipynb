    "# Observations about prototype initializations\n",
    "\n",
    "In it's original version, ProtoryNet uses kmedois to initialize its prototypes. \n",
    "More specifically, if we use $k$ prototypes in the model, k-medoids clustering is applied on some sentences of the training set with $\\text{number of clusters} = k.$\n",
    "The resulting $k$ centroids are used as the initial prototypes. \n",
    "Note that note all sentences in the training are used in the clustering because with after more than 30000 sentences, approximately, the kmedoids algorithm runs into memory issues. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we illustrate that when using the kmedoids initialization in our dataset some prototypes are redundant.\n",
    "In other words, some of the initial prototypes are repeated, they are the same sentence.\n",
    "In previous experiments we observed that prototypes sometimes get \"stucked\" (the don't change) and lack diversity.\n",
    "These two problems could be feeding one another.\n",
    "The lack of diversity persist after training for many epochs, which might indicate that when starting with repeated prototypes it's hard for the model to adquire prototype heterogenity.  \n",
    " \n",
    "We propose, as an alternative, to use a random initialization of the prototypes. \n",
    "This comes with the possibility of starting with a \"bad random selection\" of prototypes that won't let the model learn properly.\n",
    "As with other algorithms that can be affected by the initialization, we can run the model several times and see how the accuracy measures behave. \n",
    "\n",
    "We leave a study on the impact of different initialization for the future.  \n",
    "For the moment we focus on warranting diversity in the initialization of the prototypes. \n"
