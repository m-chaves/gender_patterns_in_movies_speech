1	RENT A STEAM CLEANER. The location is very, very inconvenient, but I am sure that is nothing they can help, it is just how the city has grown around their location. I would have rated the room as a 4 or 5 for clean if the sofa was not so disgusting. I literally covered it with a sheet just to sit on it. There was not one inch of surface that was not covered with a greasy/dirty stain. I would have switched rooms if I hadn't already unloaded all of my stuff in the rain before I turned on the lights to reveal the nasty sofa. Otherwise, the room was clean and comfortable. It would be worth a couple of hundred dollars to get a steam cleaner and clean the sofas in each room. Not to mention how unsanitary it is.
1	Great hotel and staff - recommend. I came in late after a long drive from Vegas ending in a whole lot of highway exits and concentration to get to Napa! I was greeted by a friendly night staff who was expecting me, and (not sure of his name) made me feel more relaxed immediately. I even got a little welcome pack with a snack and water. That was much appreciated!Breakfast was not included, fruit and granola bars were out in the lobby. A hotel discount was offered at the friendly Denny's next door. My room was quiet and all 3 of the morning staff were incredibly helpful the next morning helping me map out my day of driving, and helping me choose and book my next hotels. The hotel is a convienent location, not too far off the main highway. Near all services and malls if needed.We are glad you enjoyed your stay with us and look foward to seeing you on your next visit to the Napa Valley!
1	comfy place. We were greeted by the front desk when we arrived 3 hours prior to our check in. We were treated with respect. She guided us where we can have meals and stored our luggage. The rooms were given as early as it was ready. Loved that the room did not have carpets for allergy sufferers. Clean room. Close to Sea world and Old town. Loved the stay. Here at the Ramada Limited San Diego/Near SeaWorld, we love to accommodate! We're delighted that you got to experience the extraordinary hospitality of our team. As you noted, our location is perfect for taking in the sights of San Diego, and it is great to hear that you took advantage. Thank you for the five-star review, and we hope to see you again soon!
0	Unhappy Guest. Illegal activity going on the parking lot when we arrived. There was women standing next to motels doors waiting to be served or get served no working vending machines for a soft drink. Black mold growing in the ceiling of our room. The room stunk terribly. There were holes all in the walls and they were patched with thin metal plates. My husband stepped on something and come to find out, it was an extention cord running underneath the carpet, from the out side to the air conditioner inside. We wedged two chairs next to the door because it would not shut properly. The shower head was about to fall out. We felt gross even after a bath. We slept fully dressed because I didn't want any of body parts touching the bed.
1	Perfect family suite. Staff very friendly and informative, even before being asked. 2 room king suite exceeded expectations. Comfortable beds and plenty of linens at check in!!Dear 57crystalcThank you for your kind words regarding your stay at the Hawthorn Suites Dallas Park Central. We were glad to have you as our guest, and appreciate you taking the time to comment regarding your visit with us. We look forward to the opportunity to host you again the next time you are in the Dallas area. Thanks again for being our guest! Best regards, Charlie Westhoven Operations Manager Hawthorn Suites Dallas Park Central
1	Great service and location. We were given a beautiful room overlooking Pike's Market and the Bay. Nice size rooms and wonderful bathroom. Staff was welcoming and remembered our names as we went in and out of hotel. Well located for all public transportation and restaurants. In the middle of all the best shopping. Walked everywhere or took public transportation wherever we needed to go.Thank you for taking the time to review the Grand Hyatt Seattle. Our hotel is perfect for the recreation or business travel and is conveniently located to public transportation and many Seattle attractions. I am pleased to hear that our location, guest rooms and friendly staff made your stay enjoyable. Lindye W.Guest Relations Manager
0	I almost got sick when I saw the room. This is one of those things that I actually can semi laugh about at this time, but it sickens me still. I am very clean and neat as a pin. We needed a layover as we were moving items from our NY home to our NJ home. We had a rental truck booked and it was about 11:00 pm when... More
0	great holiday. Pluses: location, all suites Minuses: Rude and unhelpful staff, worst breakfast selection and coffee quality of any Embassy Suites I've ever stayed in
1	Great Hyatt property, a little pricey. The hotel is great, the rooms have been updated. My TV came well appointed with a new LG LED TV that was probably 50 inches, a stand alone shower with a separate bath tube. The furniture and the room are well maintained, and the hotel itself has kept current with its decor. The hotel has a nice gym, pool, and all the other things that make a Grand Hyatt a Grand Hyatt. The valet was very quick with the car which is always fantastic. My only pet peeve is that there are a Starbucks and small shop attached to the property, but they do not take room charges. When you are connected to the hotel, in the hotel's actual building, you should take room charges.
1	Very nice old city vibe. Surrounded by new urban buildings, this hotel/motel is a diamond in the rough. The exterior is clean, quaint, and the grounds are lush with flowers and shrubs in the small space the hotel occupies. Our room was clean and bathroom has been updated with modern fixtures. The room, including the bathroom, is very small with little room to spread out. I wasn't impressed with the mattress. It seemed to be either old or poor quality...maybe both. The included breakfast wasn't fancy or abundant with choices but the quality of the items provided was very good. All in all this hotel is very clean and the employees we encountered were very nice. Price was right for location, quality, and amenities.Hi fadedbjulejeans,Our entire team would like to thank you for staying at our property. We apologized for not exceeding your expectations. We will use your reviews for us to improve on those areas. We hope you consider staying with us again.
1	Courtesy and Location!. To me both a central location and my experience as a guest drive my selection of a hotel. Oh and the comfort of the beds too! Hotel Nikko has all this and more. Location is perfect, near Union Square and shopping. It is also very well situated to Bart, the subway, this makes it even easier to get around the city. We had thought that we would take the car out a couple of times, though we never did, it was just as easy to use public transportation or use our 2 feet. The only caution, and this would be throughout the city, is parking costs, so don't be shocked with the fee! I will say the valet was superb. They were swift and efficient and responsive to our requests. From the moment you step into this hotel you are welcomed. The hotel is beautiful and stylish. The check-in is thorough and not rushed, you are offered a glass of wine or if you prefer there is always iced cucumber or lemon water available in the lobby. It is these many details that cause me to take a moment to relax and enjoy my surroundings especially in a busy city. You feel cared about and to me that makes a difference. The staff are professionals, they are friendly, you are treated well, and oh, you have a great shower, so there you have it, enjoy!Dear ProudCalifNativeThank you so much for your recent review and for staying with us. We appreciate the perfect score! You mentioned so many items that made your stay memorable. I am glad the wine and water at the reception desk made you feel welcome. Your kind comments about our service have been shared with the staff. You have made their day!All of us look forward to welcoming you back to Hotel Nikko soon!Sincerely,Marcia Striffeler
1	Good location to conference. This is a good hotel for business purposes. The wi fi signal is good and it is very close to the federal reserve bank. A little too close to some of Chicago's high crime district for my taste, but we felt relatively safe. Convenient to restaurants, and decent breakfast. A solid business option.Dear Samantha HThank you for your review.I would like to reassure you that The Central Loop area of Chicago which is, as you know, also the Financial District of the City is not near any major crime area. The area is safe and very well patrolled by the Chicago Police so please do not have any concerns.I am glad you had a good stay with us and look forward to you return.Kind regardsPaul Tiernan - Hotel Manager
1	Great location and place for family with teenagers. Ideal location in quieter place off Canal within walking distance of loud French Quarters. Corner room was nice, modern and spacious for four. Need bathroom fan and better housekeeping! Lobby, lounge and bar were great...family really enjoyed the pool table and multiple board games scattered throughout. Additional perk was allowing our dog! Made all feel quite at home! We sure do love our four legged family members and we are happy to accommodate them while traveling with our guests. Thank you for your feedback and we look forward to having you back again soon!Yours in hospitality,Dixie Krauss, Operations Manager
1	Far better service than airport hotels should offer. I've stayed twice at this property - both times while running business meetings. I've been quite impressed with the staff's level of service. Their energy and attention to details have made a big difference in ensuring the meetings were successful.The hotel's facilities are well-designed and well-maintained. And while it's hardly a glamor spot, it's a VERY good choice for business travelers. It's actually quite a pleasant surprise!Dear BobRosenNY, thank you very much for taking the time to write about your visit's with us, we appreciate your business. I'll be sure to pass along your kind words and we hope to see you again in the future! Wishing you safe travels. Dieter Heigl
1	Highly Recommend! Old World Charm and Great Location!. I love the Bellevue - great historical property in the heart of Center City Philadelphia - on Broad Street with great proximity to the theaters, City Hall and shopping - short cab ride to museums and historical area.Tons of old world charm - extremely clean and furnished well. Staff was friendly, welcoming and just a pleasure. Had a great oversized king room (husband is still in awe of the quality of the tv picture ) Had drinks up on the 19th floor - beautiful views - have dined previously in the restaurant - did not this stay but would recommend especially for a special occasion. We visited for an overnight to celebrate an anniversary however I have stayed at the Bellevue for meetings/conferences and also attended weddings - regardless of reason, I have always experienced excellent service, value and always left, pleased with my stay.Thank you for choosing us to celebrate your anniversary! We are delighted that you enjoyed your stay with us, and that you felt cared for by our staff. We look forward to your next visit!Kindest regards,Michelle G.
1	Top deal in New Orleans, but.... I live within an hour of New Orleans, so I go often. I have stayed in many hotels. The Drury Inn became my go-to hotel. But it has been a while since I stayed overnight in NOLA. My last Drury review, the hotel was the greatest thing since man canned beer. But upgrades have knocked it down a notch. First the positives: it is about 4 blocks off of the French Quarter. So certainly close enough to walk in a couple minutes, but far enough away that it is quiet. You can actually sleep when you are ready. The breakfast is awesome with eggs, grits (real creamy grits), sausage, waffle makers, plus, plus. The 5pm kick back includes 3 free drinks and enough real food to count as dinner. While you have to eat at some NOLA restaurants to get the full NOLA experience, free breakfast and free dinner easily can save you 100 a day as a couple, making the trip more affordable. The rooms are updated, clean and comfortable.My only negative is the updates. They used to have free self parking. Now there is ONLY 28 a day for valet parking. Don't rent a car if you are flying in. The city is very walkable. But when you drive in like me, it really ups the cost. Then the convenience of the valet parking is negated by the very poor management of the process. You can not call down from your room to have your car pulled up front like any other hotel. You have to come down in person. For most of my stay there was only 1 guy around. He was fetching other cars and it took forever to get ours. Same thing when you return to the hotel. No one around, and you may wait 20-30 minutes to drop off your car. Frustrating to say the least. I would have MUCH, MUCH rather self parked.Thanks for your recent stay with us, and the kind words about the hotel and its offerings. Also, thanks for feedback on the parking. As you noted, we do only have valet parking now and it is at a fee. I was not aware of free parking in the past, but did some digging and found that in 2010, when construction on the addition began and during your last stay, free parking was offered. Also, please know that we do allow for call down for car retrieval as long as it is not raining or a large check-out. I will get with the valet team, and repeat that these are the only periods when guests are asked to come down. We look forward to seeing you again,Patrick D. General Manager
1	Maybe more like 3.5 stars.... The location is outstanding. The price was very fair (109+tax on a Friday night). They gave me a recently remodeled upgraded King room with a fantastic view of City Hall and downtown. Check-in was easy, and the man who helped us was pleasant.The remodeled room was large, colorful, and trendy. The bathroom was very nice and spacious (shower and toilet in one room, sink in another), all with new fixtures. There was plenty of closet, drawer, and desk space. However, when I opened one of the drawers, a prior guest must have left behind some very expensive perfume. That seems like something the cleaning lady should have caught.The sheets, while pristine and white, had a few stray hairs and strings. The carpet in the room and hallways looked very dirty and covered in dust. Some parts of the headboard were quite dusty. Despite the recent remodel, there was a large crack in the ceiling and some of the end tables were very beat up. The window was very dirty.Still, for the price and location, however, it is well worth it for a quick a stay.
1	On the edge of the French Quarter. Quiet, clean reasonably priced. Great value!. We stayed four nights and overall we were very pleased. The staff is friendly and courteous. Check-in was easy and our room was clean and comfortable. The first night there were some loud party animals next door shouting drunkenly into the wee hours. After I called the front desk and complained, the noise died down and they weren't a problem any other night. We slept well and we had everything we needed.Breakfast was varied and plentiful. This is not a gourmet meal but it is good food (eggs, bacon, waffles, oatmeal, fruit, muffins, etc.) and we enjoyed eating by the pool in the courtyard. Very pleasant.The hotel is conveniently located at the edge of the French Quarter...away from the noise but a pleasant walk to the interior and minutes from everything. Honestly, we felt lucky to find this place. It isn't fancy, but it is very clean and fit our needs. The hotel staff answered questions and were very gracious. Check-out was easy and they held our bags. We were very happy with the location and value. The only other snafu we had was one afternoon we got back about 5:00 and they hadn't cleaned our room. Somehow the maid had skipped ours, but when we asked her to take care of it she did right away. We loved our stay and we'll be back!!Hello Ma'am,Thank you for the many kind words your shared about our property. We apologize for the mishap with housekeeping during your stay. We have added a new team member in a supervisory position to improve our tracking and service. We are glad that you otherwise felt well taken care of and sincerely thank you for your patronage!Teresa Munoz - Revenue Manager
1	It was relaxing. Overall the stay was very good. The shuttle service was very helpful and the drivers were friendly and gave us good information on where to eat or have fun. The pool was relaxing and clean although the hot tub was way too hot. The pool has an adult time after 11:00pm but it is not monitored so the pool and hot tub had kids (both from and not from the hotel) in it at that time. Get to the pool early to get a seat as there are not many and they go fast. It was nice to use the bikes for a ride since they are free for the first 3 hours. I would return to the Hotel in the future.
1	Exceeded Expectations. Location, room, and staff all excellent. In the center of the city close to Reading Terminal market and walking distance to Independence Hall (about a mile) and to Museum of Art 1.5 miles. wear you're walking shoes, but you are also right across from the Septa Line at old City Hall. And speaking of City Hall, what a view! Asked ahead of time for a room and we were so fortunate to look upon the City Hall building with William Penn standing above the clock tower. It is part of the skyline and could see it all the way from the Stadium complex. Best Courtyard I have ever stayed in.Dear BobfinNH,Thank you for choosing Courtyard Philadelphia Downtown during your recent visit to the area. We appreciate your comment that this is the best Courtyard you have ever stayed in. We have a very unique hotel, in that we are in an historic building from 1926 which was completely modernized in 1999 and completed renovation in 2014. As you mentioned, we also benefit from an outstanding location in the heart of the city, with easy access by walking and also public transportation for a small fee. We look forward to having you back with us soon.
1	Outstanding Location Wonderful Hospitality!. The Courtyard San Diego Old Town is my new favorite hotel! The location is perfect - within easy walking distance (a few blocks) of the amazing restaurants and shops in Old Town. The front desk staff are very hospitable and eager to assist. The property is beautiful and the decor is true to the area. I enjoyed my stay here tremendously!Jjhoster Thank you so much for taking the time to let us now how your stay was. Glad we were able to wow you and allow us to become your new home away from home. Can't wait to have you back, thanks again!!
0	Second Time is Not a Charm. I stayed at this hotel about a month before this stay and was not impressed. They were under construction so I decided to try it again. When I made the reservation, they made sure to tell me they were still under construction. I said I understood and all I was really looking to do was sit by the pool for... More

0	Hilton disappointed. Not good value. No free breakfast. Did not recognize Hilton Honors member Staff could care less upon arriving. Breakfast was either 5.99 or 12. 99 pp. Breakfast bagels were stale and service ok. No coffee in lobby only lemonade Dear richardrG4463RAThank you for taking the time to share your experience about your recent stay at our hotel and for your patronage to our brand. Please accept our sincerest apologies for the issues you experienced upon arrival and with our breakfast. Although we offer various dining options including a full-service restaurant and room service, we apologize for any miscommunication regarding our dining choices. Additionally, we want our guests to encounter a well-trained staff that puts a guest's comfort and satisfaction ahead of anything else so your feedback has been shared with our team to take corrective action and ensure we are better poised to serve you on a future visit. I hope you will see this as an isolated incident and hope to welcome you back for a much-improved visit.Sincerely,Michael GoldwasserGeneral Manager
1	Good spot. The Westin is located right downtown about 3 blocks from the center of the Harbor - an easy walk. As a matter of fact cruisers can be seen dragging their bags from the cruise pier to the hotel the walk is so short. The hotel is modern style and from the interior one could be anywhere in a Westin. Room was large and comfortable, clean. Didn't use the restaurants or bar as preferred to walk down to Harbor area. Very good advance purchase internet rate made it even more attractive. Will stay here again.notnecessary - Thank you for sharing your feedback with Trip Advisor. We find our location to be perfect for all types of guests. We are centrally located between several neighborhoods making it easy to walk and get around without having a vehicle. Always remember to check Westin.com for great promotional rates. We look forward to seeing you again soon. Be Well, Alyssa TurowskiGeneral Manager
1	amazing location, space, and stellar fellow travelers. I stayed in Chicago by myself a week ago for 5 nights in a women's dorm room while going on a marathon of architecture tours. I stayed here to save money and to hopefully meet some other architecture enthusiasts. I had seen this hotel listed in an article listing places for people coming for the first Chicago Architectural Biennial in 2015.I didn't meet architecture tourists, but my fellow roommates were about the 7 most varied and amazing women I have come across in a long time. Let's just say that the first roommate I met was an Italian (Sicilian) who looked like your typical gorgeous, put-together Italian who was there for a conference from a residency in New York who is a neurosurgeon who stayed there in order to meet people. She introduced me to the hotel and to the other roommates not in the room at the time. From there I met an Indonesian coming back on her own to visit where she and her husband had lived as students, French student on her way home, local back from Cuba, Korean exchange student seeing the US, Bostonian in town for wedding (2nd generation from China), and a Detroit auto designer for GM (fresh from Australia).The location couldn't be better. I walked to almost everything. The hotel design is well thought out and interesting. The dorm rooms are tight but it was ok. I had the room to myself usually a couple of times each day.There are a certain number of details that are sort of loosely attended to. For instance the simple breakfast served is a bit of rolling chaos, sometimes no spoons, sometimes no coffee. But such an amazing collection of people in that room every day.I used their simple kitchen to cook for myself a couple of nights to save money and to just hole up when I was worn out. Overall, I felt very lucky to have the Freehand as my base for the week.Hello Kristi, Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to review your stay. I am so glad to hear you loved your visit and had the chance to meet so many amazing people. I am also glad you enjoyed the location and that you were able to take advantage of the amenities on property. We feel lucky to have had you as our guest and I hope we can see you back again very soon!
0	WHAT A PIGS HOLE. I stayed ONE night, before I could get my bag out of the car, I was propositioned twice, and three times asked if I wanted to buy drugs.

0	Absolutely horrible!. Probably the worst ever. Incredibly distasteful. No hot water. Inoperable phone in room. Overcharged for parking. Deceptive pricing. No bathroom in room. Discourteous staff.

1	amazing stay at JW Marriott. its a great place, its location is fantastic with some of the best shopping and eating attractions nearby. Lenox mall is adjacent and some of the biggest shopping chains are a walk away. you will find some of the great eating places all around it. the hotel in itself is pretty great, beautifully done, and aesthetically pleasing. Rooms are great, all amenities provided, bathrooms are clean and well kept. The restaurant in the hotel offers great food, you can have your meals here too. The best part about this property is the staff, the staff is friendly, courteous, they take care of you and help you. i had such an awesome experience in this place, i would recommend it to everyone to come and experience it yourself.Dear Richa S,Thank you for being our guest at JW Marriott Atlanta Buckhead and for recommending us to others. It is rewarding to know you had an outstanding stay and that our dedicated associates helped to craft a seamless experience during your visit. We look forward to hosting you again in the near future.Best Regards,Eb MbyeDirector of Operations
1	Home Away from Home. The Hacienda Hotel is like a home away from home for me. I travel a lot and my stay here is always exceptional. The Hacienda is a beautiful hotel, the grounds are breathtaking, the area is safe, the hotel rooms are clean, and the staff are very friendly, especially McKenzy. The last time I stayed here my son proposed to his girlfriend by the courtyard fountain. So the Hacienda will always be very special to me!!!What a sweet memory! Thank you for taking the time to share why our hotel is special to you. Ill let McKenzy know she was in your thoughts and her warmth left a lasting impression. For anyone planning a family reunion or group visit, McKenzy is a great person to speak with. We hope you will visit again soon!
0	Dirty, Dark, and Smelly. I read the Trip Advisor reviews prior to making reservations for a 3-day stay and felt comfortable with the anticipated accommodations.

I feel sorry for the staff working in such an... More

1	Perfect stay if they just can get billing correct.. The wife and I, along with 2 other couples stayed at the JW Marriott this past week on the Wine Down Weekend Package. The stay was outstanding. From valet, check-in, porter, restaurant staff, to the concierge the staff could not have been friendlier or more willing to go out of their way to be helpful. Except for the fact that the rooms do not have a refrigerator they were very perfect, with the most comfortable bedding we ever had in a hotel.All in all an excellent stay that would have been perfect if they could just get the billing issues straighten out.
1	Good value, great location!. We took a 3 day trip to New Orleans and wanted to stay close to the French Quarter without spending an arm and a leg. I mean how long are you going to be in the room anyway The rooms were not huge, but they were clean and the beds were very comfortable. This is an old restored building which has lots of charm. The elevators are tiny and there is a nice courtyard with a pool and seating areas. (we were there in the winter) They offer a free continental breakfast, including eggs, sausage, biscuits and more. The bartender was friendly and very helpful with local attractions. They have free WI-FI and a small business center that makes it handy to print your boarding passes. The hotel is just a few blocks from Bourbon Street, and is far enough that you don't have to listen to all the noise. They do have an airport shuttle, BUT you must reserve it at least 24 hours in advance. If only the front desk had told us this little detail, we could have saved some money. I would stay here again on a future visit.
0	Normally like Hamptons - not this one!. If you like King rooms, be prepared not to have a bath. None of their King rooms have baths, only showers. I could not properly wash my hair with a tiny showerhead. Many King rooms have communicating doors to the next room, which are good noise-carriers. With regard to noise: the rooms at the freeway end of the hotel are very noisy, much more so than other hotels we've stayed in on Hotel Circle South. We were living out of our suitcases because of the ridiculous size of the drawers in the room (basically the size of nightstand drawers - see picture). The pool is the size of a large hot-tub. Breakfast had many items but lacked quality: the only good things we found were yoghurt and fresh fruit, cooked food was poor.Hotel staff were helpful and did their best to resolve our issues in a not-so-great hotel. Next San Diego visit: back to the Doubletree.
1	Great hotel, small room. I was very impressed with the Sorrento Hotel. The bed was covered in high quality pillows of varying firmness, the sheets were also high quality, and the comforter was similar to the Heavenly bed at Westin. Free high speed internet access was definitely a major plus, as were the free NY Times and Wall Street Journal in the lobby.Although their valet parking was expensive, there is plenty of metered on street parking in the area (meters not read from 6 pm to 8 am).My only complaint was that the room was somewhat small for a hotel of this quality. Although the square footage was probably about average, a lot of in was wasted on the long hallway in the room. The actual living area was somewhat cramped, especially when the pillows were removed from the bed. Still, I thought the hotel was an excellent value for the money, and I would definitely stay there again.
0	Needs staff improvement. When we arrived at the hotel at 4.30PM well past the check in time of 3 PM, the clerk told us that the room was not ready, could not tell how long it would be before the room would be ready. He did not explain why the room was not ready. His attitude was that it was that way and there was nothing he could do about it. We had to wait for over one hour and only when we approached the clerk and inisted on the room then only he procedded to give us a room. The next day we returned from a late breakfast at 12:05 pm and we were not able to get into our room as the card would not unlock the door.
0	Very very small rooms.. While the staff was friendly, the rooms were so small that had our children been a little older we couldn't have all sat in the same room. Breakfast was terrible. The pool is also very small. We ended up switching hotels.
0	pay more and stay some place nicer. Had a terrible stay. I've stayed in many extended stays across the country and this one has shamed the brand. This hotel smelled, it was unclean, dark and cramped. The rooms were dated,my mattress didn't even have a fitted sheet I saw how nasty and disgusting the conditions of the mattresses. We didn't have any toilet paper in our room upon arrival.the room was less than mediocre. Towels were dingy and worn out. Fire detector was hanging on by a wire literally about to fall off the ceiling. hotel was in bad condition, was more like a motel. Will never stay here again. next time I'll pay more money to stay in a better hotel.
1	Very nice hotel, close to the airport.. When we checked in, we had no toiletries due to the strict airline restrictions from Canada, so the clerk at the front desk took care of everything for us with complimentary necessities. We were also given a complimentary appetizer for their restaurant, and were informed that daily happy hours was between 5:30 - 7:30 pm. Our room was really nice, clean and comfortable with updated furnishings. A little more attention to detail could have been made with the cleaning reagarding some marks and soiling on the walls, but nothing to complain about. After having spent over 30 hours travelling, we were very pleased to find that happy hour consisted of our choice of a long list of spirits, beer, and wine (unlimited), as well as tortilla chips, salsa and guacamole - all complimentary. A full breakfast buffet is included, which is as good as anywhere we've ever been. Sausage, bacon, scrambled eggs, hashbrowns, milk, juice, tea, coffee, bagels, toast, english muffins, sweet buns, fruit, yogurt, and made to order omlette. Lunch and supper in the restaurant was also really good. Some of the best wings I've ever had.
1	Historic, Well Maintained and Comfortable Hotel. On a recent business trip to New Orleans, I was able to extend my stay for an evening and in doing so, I chose to stay closer to the French Quarter (the host hotel was near the Superdome, about 1 mile away). The hotel structure itself dates to the 1800's as the very knowledgeable front desk clear explained when I inquired. She knew all the details and was very proud to share her knowledge. It certainly made for a very nice welcome at check-in (which was efficient and quick).After quickly settling in, I was off to explore the French Quarter and the hotel location on the edge of the historic district makes walking to everything quite easy, yet it's just far enough away from the nightlife to keep things quiet at night. Shops, restaurants, bars and historic sites are all around and across the street Louis Armstrong Park can be accessed a few blocks away.My room on the 2nd floor overlooked the lovely courtyard with trees, chairs to relax and an out door pool. The room was fresh and clean with comfortable beds, a pleasant bathroom with ample lighting, free Wi-Fi (easy to connect and fast speed), a refrigerator, HDTV and safe (large enough for my 14 laptop). The only item needing attention in my room was the grout in the shower, which must be a challenge in such a humid climate.Considering this is such a historic property, they have done a nice job connecting all the buildings and keeping the guest room modern yet with old world charm. Rooms face the courtyard, nearby buildings, the street - so be sure to request the view / area that most suits your needs.Although I did not take advantage of the pool, I did enjoy the complimentary breakfast in the morning. A nice mix of hot and cold options, including waffles, eggs, yogurt, cereal, etc. The staff were ever present and helpful to guests, a very positive experience. My only complaint was the oatmeal was only available using the instant packets, which is never as good as a nice hot crock often found at hotels today.In the evening, the hotel also opens the breakfast area for food and drinks, but I explored the area instead. The hotel lends itself to a relaxing escape, and I ended up meeting a couple who are regulars to the hotel and New Orleans! The best guest is a repeat one and that certainly speaks to the quality experience.While the focus appears to be leisure travelers, the hotel has everything required for a business traveler as well. If returning to New Orleans, I would certainly return again and would recommend to anyone looking for a clean, comfortable, affordable hotel with nice amenities. For meeting all my needs and the expectations of a Best Western Plus hotel, I would certainly rate my experience 5 stars.We are glad that we were able to be a nice break from your business trip and hope to see you again the next time you are in New Orleans.Thank You, Bryant Faul - General Manager
0	Don't Stay Here. While the property is new and has great potential, they also have the rudest staff Management I have ever experienced. I'm a platnium Marriott member and have never before been to a hotel that tried so hard to make me uncomfortable. I shortened a 7 nite stay to 1 nite and found another hotel in the area that was happy to have my business and make me feel comfortable.
1	Birthday trip to NOLA. For my mother's 90th birthday, she wanted to go to New Orleans (has not been since 1959) and we had a fabulous time. My thanks to the Whitney for making her feel so special, absolutely everyone at the hotel was gracious, helpful, polite and fun. The hotel was completely booked, but our spacious rooms/bathrooms were cleaned promptly and it was not noisy. I highly recommend the Whitney Hotel for the perfect stay in New Orleans...Cathy ThomasNashville, TNWe're so pleased to hear you enjoyed your trip to the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans and thank you for the kind words. We'll pass your praise onto the Staff. Please let us know if we can accommodate your next Big Easy get-a-way. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
1	Nice enough hotel. Nice enough hotel - not my favorite. My big complaint is the shower. I had close to no water pressure, and it took forever to rinse my hair. Other than that, it was a nice enough property, and all of the service was very friendly. Room service was good, and we enjoyed the small restaurant/ lounge in the lobby as well.Thank you for your visit and for taking the time to post your review. While I do have our engineering team checking water pressure in various rooms to ensure all showers are working as they should, if you would like to reach out to us directly to let us know which room you specifically stayed in it would be helpful so that we can drill down on it specifically. We are happy that overall you enjoyed your stay and hope to see you again. Thanks for letting us know.
0	Worse place I ever stayed in San Francisco. They lost my reservation,that should have been a clue, I should have left right then and there. The room was the size of a postage stamp.The mattress was way too soft. Internet was slower than molasses. Breakfast consisted of few donuts,mini muffins, 2 beat up apples and instant coffee. The TV was whistling the whole time,I think it was a model from the '90. Never again will they see me there. Book a room across the street at the Lobard Motor Inn, you'll be happy there.
1	Good Convention Center Hotel. We had a conference and the Rosen and were looking for a more inexpensive place to stay. I decided to try the Best Western and was pleased with it. The only negative was that the wireless service in my room wasn't great. It dropped me several times. Breakfast was good with hot food. All the staff were pleasant and good to work with. The room was clean and comfortable. The bed was a little on the hard side for my liking but not bad. I didn't have any problem sleeping. Our room was right next to the elevator which I usually don't like but never heard it the whole time. The fitness center had good equipment in it that worked well. There is an outdoor pool but it was too cool for a swim (though there were kids enjoying it).The price was good so I'd stay another time I'm in the area. The Village Inn restaurant right next door is a good family restaurant to eat at while staying at the Best Western. Prices were very good and serving sizes were large. We really enjoyed the personality of our server and the manager.
0	Felt the staff was very unapproachable and had do.. Very clean hotel but staff from the minute checked in just felt like they had better things to do with their time and really would rather be somewhere else. We would ask them questions and they either ignored us or their person conversations were more important. Will not be staying there again.
1	Expectations largely met. I recently stayed at the Drury Inn for 3 nights. I was assigned a corner room on the 6th fl that had two exposures of Poydras street. I was very satisfied with the room. It was quiet (some minor street noise), very well appointed, had a nice whirlpool type jet tub, and the TV channel selection was decent. The room was clean and well cared for. The hotel was very nice, had some character, and was close to most of what people want to see when visiting New Orleans. However, it was a few blocks from most of those attractions, which I didnt mind, but someone who wants to be in the thick of the action might find it disappointing being in the business district where the hotel is. The walk to the waterfront or Bourbon Street was about 6 blocks and felt safe even at night. The free food and drink was a big plus. The breakfast offerings met all my expectations. Well-cooked scrambled eggs, waffles, bagels, etc. The afternoon happy hour selection was weaker. The hot dogs were consistently under cooked and somewhat unattractive in appearance. I would say beef was either non-existent or way down on the ingredients listing. The other foods were satisfactory, but nothing off the charts. Hey, but this was all free, so I cant subtract points. But if you plan on feasting your physician will take exception with your meal choices. In a general sense, based on observations at various times during my midweek visit, this hotel tends to attract a somewhat older crowd.say vacationing retirees. I only saw 1 child during my 3 day visit and limited people in their 40s or less. My only real issue with the hotel was the fitness center. It literally consisted of 2 treadmills and a bike. Nothing else. If a hotel advertises offering such an amenity, I dont think such a limited offering qualifies. While there was a sign up suggesting an improved offering will be forthcoming when the new hotel wing is complete, that didnt help me on my visit and I only consider hotels that offer such because I plan on using them. I wasnt able to here.All in all, I was satisfied with my stay despite the fitness center misrepresentation. I would not hesitate to select the Drury on a future stay.
1	Good choice. We were very tired when we arrived with a cranky baby. Pierre at the front desk was very helpful and got us in our room quickly. We had some difficulty with the door, the handle had to be pushed up, instead of down, which delayed us getting into the room. The room was clean though somewhat worn/dated (old phones, ceiling in bathroom had areas that needed repair/patched, carpet was threadbare in some areas, etc.). We were thankful that the room was very quiet which help us to get a good few hours of sleep before my daughter and grandson's flight. The shuttle driver that took us to BWI was exceptionally helpful and I was very grateful that he came back to pick me up after seeing my daughter and grandson off.
1	I'd Stay Here Again. I booked this place last minute in order to attend the SF Pride. Arrived in the evening, checkin was flawless, the front desk guy very personable friendly. I was upgraded to a king suite which was nice. The room itself was clean, modern, looked exactly like the pictures on the website. On my floor (7th) there was a lounge- that I never saw occupied, but had a couch amenities of which a group of people could entertain. One main note- the hotel was relatively quiet! Considering it was a busy weekend and I saw a number of people coming going.There's a Walgreens with a grocery store next door within walking distance. The BART is only about a 10 minutes walk away- as is the case with shopping and the heart of SF. Numerous eateries abound the area. There's a Blues bar night club a couple minutes from the hotel, but didn't have time to explore. I felt safe walking around here during the day and at night while coming back from the BART. I would stay here again if I go back to SF. Oh, there's also a few art galleries down the street that I would have loved to have visited, but we're closed. Also a theater across the street. Loved it!!Hi Dee T.Thank you for making Hotel Diva a part of your LGBT Pride celebration. I hope you had a wonderful time with the many festivities going on in town. We look forward to welcoming you back at Hotel Diva.Best regards,Virgil LopezHotel Manager
1	Good service, reliable business. I received a good service in Shoreline hotel. The room is as clean as new. The staff is very nice as family. The shampoo and hair conditioner is very is great. And there is one thing I want to share. I parked my car the first night here, they refund me the parking fee in the next day when I find a cheaper parking lot near the hotel next day. Then they phoned me that my car will be towed away if I parked illegally, which made me very touched. Overall, execellent service , reasonable price.I will recommend it.Aloha,Thank you for your kind words and 5 star review on Tripadvisor. We are pleased to see that you had an enjoyable stay and that we were able to exceed your expectations. If your travels bring you back to the area please consider another stay with us. Thank you once again for your review, we hope to see you again.Mahalo,Jerome YapchingAssistant Front Office Manager
1	comfy stay. I stayed here 8/15/14 and they were able to get me an early check-in which was before 12pm to which i am very appreciative. The room was comfy for a single person. Big comfortable bed. They have those rain shower fixture + a hand held shower in the bathroom. The place is very close to the gas lamp area and to the train station which is what I took to San Diego. The front desk people are very pleasant.RCAlvarez, All of our guest rooms hold the Westin Signature Heavenly Bed and Drench showerhead. We guarantee a superior slumber on our Westin Heavenly Bed.

1	Great Place to Stay. This hotel was very clean and the staff were friendly. The hotel served a different breakfast course each day to accompany their regular daily meals so you could have variety. The pool was crystal clear and the beds were comfortable. Great Place to Stay!I appreciate you taking time to review your stay with us here at the Best Western Mission Bay. I am happy to know you had a great stay and were happy with our rooms and comfortable beds. I appreciate your compliments to our pool, I will pass your comments to our maintenance team.

1	Smallest room I've ever had. First off I'll start with The Saint is an unique boutique hotel that sits on Eaton Street with access to Duval Street. We had booked what they call the petite double I believe and they aren't wrong. My husband paced it out and we figured it was approx 150 square feet. That being said it did have everything you needed and was tastefully done, but you'd never want to stay in it more then a night or two. They had a lovely balcony over looking Duval Street that sadly for us was 1 room away from ours and on NY's Eve they had their party on it . I wish I would have known this in advance as laying in bed after midnight it felt and sounded as if I was still in the middle of the dance floor. That aside I suppose I should have expected that being NY's but I've never been in a hotel especially a Marriott where the party was more important to the guest comfort. They have a lovely bar in the lobby away from the guest rooms which would have been a better and less noisy option for the quests who weren't attending their NYs party. All and all I'd say there are plenty of other choices to stay at in Key West at comparable costs (this wasn't cheap at 448.00 per night for 2 for the smallest room) that would cater more to the comfort of their guests then the 50 dollars a person they made at the NY's party.I apologize for the noise on New Year's Eve. Key West is a hot spot for the holiday and our hotel is known for the balcony countdown party overlooking Duval Street. The rates are comparable to other hotels for that night yet may have not been quieter on this busy day on the island. We hope you will give us another visit on a non-holiday and reserve one of our larger Superior King rooms that will be more comfortable for you. Happy New Year to you and your family.
0	Hotel under construction with terrible staff. Hotel was under construction and smelled bad and was very messy. On top of that the staff was bad. We were in a rush and needed a cab to get to an event. We told the man at the desk to call a cab when we checked in. When we came down later he hadn't gotten a cab for us, so we asked him to call the cab again. After sitting in the lobby for 15 minutes waiting, we asked when our cab was coming and he said he didnt know we still wanted a cab and would call. Eventually 25 minutes later a cab dropped someone off at the hotel and we were able to take that cab.
1	Modern Hotel. Customer Service Needs Work. This is one of the newest hotels in Key West. It's located in the new section of town and is about a 15 minute car ride to Duval St. The rooms and facilities are modern. The customer service was variable and I was disappointed with their lack of assistance when we encountered an issue with our air conditioner. Parking is free, wifi is decent and free, there is also a free breakfast which was nice. Best of all, no resort fee. Dear netgeek,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. We take all of our reviews seriously so that we can better serve our guests. I apologize for that lack of assistance regarding your air conditioner, and I will be getting with my staff so that they better assist our guests better when they are having issues with our hotel. I hope that you will return so that next time we can better serve you.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager
1	A Diamond in the Rough!. Just got back from SD and five nights at the Pearl. Kimberly Parker and her staff did a terrific job in taking care of all of our needs and making us feel very welcomed! We travel often and have never received hospitality such as this. The property is retro, comfortable and well cared for. The restaurant is outstanding and the drinks are unique and excellent. Our next visit to SD will involve another visit to the Pearl, and all around great experience!Greatly appreciate you taking time to write a review. Glad you had a great stay with us. Please come visit again soon!!!! Going to share your review with our team. Our restaurant is amazing, glad you got a chance to enjoy it. Tell a Friend.
1	Great hotel in so so location. My husband and I found this hotel on Snique Away and decided to stay for a couple of nights before a wedding in Hermosa Beach. For starters, the valet guys are awesome! They are extremely helpful and informative and quick to give good service. If you drive to the hotel, you don't have a choice but to valet which is an added 20/night or so. Other than that, the service was mediocre at best. I rarely saw the front desk people smile and housekeeping is extremely slow to respond to requests. They even ended up with a shirt of mine (i think on accident) and didn't return until i called and then took hours to bring to us. The slow service might have something to do with the confusing maze like set up of the rooms and layout itself. Rooms are very nice. Comfy beds and nice shower. We had a tiny balcony but there are some bigger ones. The salt water pool and hot tub are great! But if you want to have a good time at the pool this is not the hotel for you. It was absolutely silent-no music- no bar. can call for service there if you'd like. The location itself is not ideal. It is in a beautiful part of la jolla but you cannot walk anywhere but to glider/black beach which is a great place if you want to hike and privately surf but be aware that it is nudist. It is a short 10 min drive into downtown la jolla or to del mar but if you want to walk to restaurants/shops, it's better to stay in downtown la jolla instead. There are 3 restaurants on site but all serve the same menu which is wierd. I recommend the chips and salsa (put a great spice on the chips) and the ravioli dish. We didn't order room service so can't comment on that. The gym didn't have much to offer. I have heard the spa is the best in all la jolla although I didn't indulge :(All in all, i was pleased since we got a good deal but would not pay the full price they demand. I instead would stay downtown.Thank you for your review! We are elated to hear how much you enjoyed your stay at the Estancia La Jolla Hotel Spa. We apologize for the miscommunication regarding parking. You can self park as well, next time please ask and we will show you how! We know our location is a little bit out of town, and we think it's great! There is so much to do at the resort, that we feel you never need to leave. Take a dip in the jacuzzi or get a facial at the spa, or even a margarita at Mustangs Burros. Please join us again soon, we would love to see you!
0	There were BEDBUG in my bed.. I found bedbug on my arm and my bed!!! Immediately, I took shower and packed my stuffs. It was around 1:00:am. I drove my car to my client's parking lot and slept inside of my car until next morning.
0	Typical business hotel. A typical business hotel. Everything you may need is available. But not charming at all. I needed a while to find the hotel, because it is hard to find by night. I stayed there for 2 nights and I will never come back. Please clean the windows and the rooms, everything is real dirty.Thank you for your feedback Christian K as it is imperative to our hotels success!I am sorry you found your windows and room cleanliness unacceptable and will address this with the team immediately. Our team works very hard to keep every room and bathroom clean we strive to exceed expectations every day. Please accept my sincere apologies for not meeting your expectations and know I will address your feedback directly with our team. If there is anything else I can do for you, please contact me at the phone number or email below. We hope you will consider staying with us again in the future. At Hilton Garden Inn, we promise to do whatever it takes to ensure you are satisfied. You Can Count On Us. Guaranteed.Sincerely,Shane DustinFront Office ManagerHilton Garden InnShane.Dustinhilton.com 858-946-1043
1	Bachelorette weekend. We came downtown for my sisters bachelorette weekend and decided to stay here. What a great decision. Centrally located in the loop close to restaurants, theaters and shopping. The hotel is exquisite in its decor. The staff can not be anymore friendly and ready to accommodate you. Every evening between 5-6pm with your room key there is free Proseco or Sangria in the lobby bar area. And believe me all the guests take advantage of it. Right now they are doing a bit of construction so there are some noisy periods but besides that no complaints. Rooms decent size for downtown. Love their amenities. Bonus there is a Starbucks connected to the hotel on the first floor. I usually am not disappointed by a Kimpton property and I can add this one to the list. Great customer service and a charming art deco vibe is what we aim for! Thanks for staying with us. We work hard to make our guests happy and appreciate your feedback!
1	A fantastic surprise in a great location. What a great surprise. Had to book a hotel at the last (LAST) minute and selected Orchard. The hotel is fantastic. Very clean and modern with well appointed rooms. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the rooms and bathroom had plenty of space and I never felt crowded.Most of all, the doorman and staff were the friendliest I ever encountered. I stayed three nights and the staff was fantastic every night.Next time I am out in SF, I will be seeking out this hotel. It is definitely on my go-to list.We're glad you could find a cozy room here in a pinch, Anthony! Furthermore, it's fantastic that our service staff and doorman made you feel right at home. We'd love to welcome you back the next time you visit San Francisco.Wishing you all the best,The Orchard Garden Hotel
1	A charmed trip... Sometimes I find myself waiting way to long to write a good review, not this time. Planned a girls shopping trip to NYC 6 months ago and booked Ritz over other considerations. Have stayed at Ritz- Central Park one other time many years ago with family and had a magical experience. So in the efforts to recreate the last experience I booked again. In my opinion the location can not be beat (I am shocked when folks say they don't like mid town, sooooo much to do within feet from hotel). From the second you arrive you are made to feel increadably special, amazing welcoming staff. We splurged and upgraded to club level (highly recommend for many reasons), so we checked in and headed to club level for a much needed cocktail. The Club lounge is beautiful and very welcoming. Equiped with heavy appetizers, wine, champagne, bottled water, etc it was a sight for sore eyes (We had been traveling for 9 hours). Within a minute of arriving, Lazar who was on duty asked if we would like a beverage we said yes 'Martini's please' (can't say enough about how much we enjoyed Lazar, great personality, great martini maker, great representative to the hotel). The room was very lovely, what you would expect of a Ritz. The location of this hotel is right accross the street of central park, blocks from the best shopping anywhere in the world and you can walk to Time Square Theatre district. Sit in the lobby bar and it's people watching galore. Keep eyes pealed you just might see a celeb or two. I had very high expectations (based on last visit) and the Ritz effortlessly topped themselves. Will be back, and worth every penny.
0	Overpriced with limited services.. We needed a hotel in this part of town, but had few options. We chose this hotel based on the brand and the price. We could have stayed elsewhere for less money, but assumed the higher price meant we'd be more comfortable. We were wrong. I would consider this hotel to be at the lower end of budget hotel comfort,... More
1	Great Garden (Inn that is). From the reminder e-mail of my confirmed stay at the Hilton Garden Inn a couple of days before my arrival to check out, my experience with the hotel was perfect. The value of the entire experience seemed greater than the price. There were no short cuts in providing everything that a traveler needs.Good Day rich4elmundo, I would like to thank you on behalf of the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport team for your comments and high rating about your recent experience with us. I am happy to know that you also found our facilities and all that we offer to be at a great value. We look forward to the opportunity of welcoming you back and providing you with outstanding service once again. Travel Safe Always! Sincerely,Alex BlancoGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando International Airport
0	Schizophrenic Hotel. Wow, was this my weekend to completely strike out on the higher end hotel scene. First, the good. The staff of Millennium is first rate. The property is well staffed, well dressed, professional and courteous. And waaaay out of place. The Millennium is a four star, but the star scale appears to have increased to ten or twelve.

1	We loved it!. I took my son and daughter to Miami Sunny Isles Beach for the Surfers Healing event. This was our very first time in Miami. Being a single mom, I couldn't afford the hotels on the beach and I wanted one with a great pool, at a decent price. I was able to find this one at a GREAT price and it appeared to have a nice pool as well. This hotel was awesome! Friendly staff, very clean room, and the beds were very comfortable as well. I had to use room service once, and they were prompt. Free parking and WIFI as well. The kids LOVED it and said that it was really nice. We would stay again if we ever come back to the area.
0	Disgusting to say the least!!!!!. If I didn't have to rate this dump I wouldn't it's not worthy of a star or a so called rating. It's filthy nasty looks lile it hasn't been cleaned in 20 yrs.

1	Spectacular view and wonderful Service :). Upon arriving to our hotel we were greeted warmly by a friendly door man then proceed to check in where a friendly and helpful gentlemen named Tim took care of us at the desk and set us up with a spacious room with a spectacular view. The stay here really helped make our trip to Chicago amazing and very enjoyable. Tim and Devon were more than willing to help us with any questions we had about getting around the city, which was a very nice gesture you don't see often. Thank You to the staff, we will definetly return to see them again the next time we are in town.
0	Loud and Rude. Average hotel with rude employees, poor customer service. The hotel is VERY loud late into the night (even on week nights), so unless you want a loud, smelly party outside your room EVERY night, stay further off Bourbon St. Dear Artchick214,We are so sorry to hear that you didnt enjoy your stay with us at Four Points French Quarter. We especially want to apologize for the poor customer service you received while at the hotel. I have passed this review on to our management team so that they may address it with the employees and use it as a training tool for future guest stays. If you would like to discuss this matter further, we encourage you to reach out to the General Manager, Beth Ables (b.ablesfourpointsfrenchquarter.com). Again, we are so sorry that your stay with us was less than satisfactory, but we do hope that the rest of your time in the French Quarter was enjoyable.
0	Dirty and not worth it!. We stayed at this hotel last night while my grandfather was hospitalized because it was attatched to the Virginia Mason Hospital. The floors were so dirty that u could see the dirt sitting on top of the carpet, the mirrors were covered in dirty streaks, and the tub was full of leftover residue from recently removed no-skid strips! I have never been in a dirtier hotel room and am absolutely appalled that it is attatched to such an amazing hospital. The front counter staff was very kind and helpful but the state of the room was unbelievable. The toilet seat nearly slid off when I sat down and the wall plugs look like they're from the 1940s as we couldn't keep a single charger from falling out of the wall. It was an absolute waste of money I have spent nights in rooms that were half the price and twice as nice. Don't waste your money here - spend the night at one of the nicer hotels that are only 5 minutes down the road for less money and a better experience.Good morning. Thank you for your comments. As you can tell from previous trip advisor reviews, your stay is not the typical experience our guests enjoy. I have shared your comments with our housekeeping team - while the rooms are older, our staff works very hard to ensure rooms are thoroughly cleaned. It was a very busy weekend in Seattle and we are proud we are able to offer an affordable alternative for guests and family members seeking medical care. We hope your grandfather is feeling better. Good luck in your future travels, Carol Gallagher
1	Friendly, Clean, Great Location and Great Restaurant. This hotel does no disappoint! From the Front Desk, to Housekeeping, the Shuttle Driver to the Restaurant and Room, they exceed expectations. Not only was the room spotless, housekeeping met me in the hallway upon arrival to ask if they could do anything else! The Bartender is AWESOME - Jim creates his own mixes from scratch and crafts each cocktail individually, no fake stuff here, all done with a great sense of humor and a bit of showmanship! The location is perfect, next to Little Italy and the restaurant/bar seating is indoor/outdoor almost park like with cushy couches and chairs. When in this city I am use to overpriced everything. This hotel is the opposite, from the cocktails to the food, it's quite reasonable. The shuttle driver is super friendly and at your service, upon arrival at Racine Station, I called and the van showed up in less than 5 minutes! On one occasion took us to 7-11, waited for us while we bought water, coffee, etc . When we called from Francesca's on Taylor, he was there in less than 5 minutes. All in all, this hotel is a Chicago Gem. We were in town for the NRA (Restaurant) show and the city was completely booked. 10.50 cab ride to McCormick and QUICK! This hotel will be my place when in Chicago! PS: I was on Marriott Points during their busiest time of year and was still treated like gold!
1	We Liked It. The basic king room is on the smaller side, but the bathroom is ultra tiny u can barely function in there. It was still perfect for 2 for a w/e getaway. Great downtown location, within walking distance to the Mag Mile The Metro is jst a couple of blocks away. We stayed the Monaco in January, which has the perfect sized basic king room for two was really nice. Here, the Allegro, the rooms are smaller, but the common spaces lobby are pretty ginormous compared to the 3 other Kimptons, in other cities, that we've stayed . The lobbies are notoriously very tiny. We got a phenomenal rate for this past w/e's stay - 125/nite + 25 per day restaurant/ bar credit. That equals 75 that we used the bar!! But watch-out, the catch is that you have 2 come to the bar/ restaurant daily jst use 25/day not use it all once like we did. BUT they did not tell us that check-in all...... But way to go, Kimpton, they honored it took 75 off! You know how 2 keep the Martins coming back! They're nice, cute quirky, we will back! Oh other review said that the walls were 'paper thin', or too much noise..... We were on the 8th floor had not 1 issue w noise all, AND I am a light sleeper too.Hi Martin's! It's great to see you were able to take advantage of one of our room packages and check out our restaurant 312 Chicago! Feel free to reach out to me directly and we can look into getting you guys upgraded into a larger room for your next visit.Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager
1	Napa. We stayed at the Best Western Plus during our long weekend trip to Napa. It was perfectly fine for what we needed, a place to sleep after touring wineries! The room was very clean. We were on the second floor by the pool (not sure if all rooms face the pool) and it was good. Only had one instance where a group of loud girls were in the pool area and it was definitely loud in our room, but thankfully it didn't last long. Overall a quiet place. Got vouchers for Denny's next door, easy and fast breakfast before our days. I saw some reviews mentioning traffic due to the location, but it was always an easy in/out for us. Would definitely stay again if in the area, since it's a great place to rest after a busy day!
0	Barking dog priority over platinum member. We stayed at this hotel for one night before leaving on a cruise to Alaska. Let me start by saying we are HUGE Marriott fans, and have always had extremely pleasant stays at the majority of properties. Sadly, this particular Marriott may be independently owned or at the very least poorly managed which resulted in us having a horrific stay. We booked four rooms in total for our group. My family had two of the rooms. We returned after a wonderful dinner at a nearby restaurant and went to our room about 10:00 pm, with our main objective being a good night's sleep so that we were ready to leave for our cruise bright and early. Imagine our surprise when the room next door had a barking dog in it. No people...just a barking dog. We called the front desk and they apologized and told us they were so sorry that this was happening. They told us that this was a service dog which was why he was allowed in the room. They then went on to say that they had the same problem the night before, had spoken to the guests and the guests assured them they would not leave the dog alone again in the room. (So this begs the question why does someone need a service job if they don't take them out with them If a person needs a service dog, shouldn't the dog be with the person.) Aside from that, however, management knew they had a pesky situation and didn't deal with it. EXCUSE ME They knew this was a problem, they assigned a person to the room next door anyway REALLY Management came up, knocked on the door, no answer, just a barking dog who was now really agitated. This barking continued until 1:00 in the morning. We called the front desk again and again. They couldn't do anything about it as the guests were not home. The hotel was full so changing rooms was not an option and why should we have to move anyway In the morning we found breakfast for all four of our group's rooms slid under the door. Sorry--we had made plans to go to Pike's Market to explore and have breakfast before getting to the ship for our cruise. We requested a refund of points for the one room we booked on points and requested a refund for the cost of the other room. The manager informed us he was not authorized to refund our money or points. We dealt with Marriott Rewards to get our points refunded however, we were not ever able to get a refund of our cash account as the manager felt the breakfasts equalled the cost of our room---however since we didn't use the breakfasts we were not compensated at all. So why even give them one star They recommended a wonderful restaurant nearby that our entire family enjoyed. I will return to Seattle, I will NEVER stay in this hotel unless I hear that new management has taken over.Dear Guest,Thank you for spending the time to share your experience at Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union. Your feedback means a lot to us. We sincerely apologize for the noise disturbance from other guest rooms. Your feedback will be reported to our manager so that situations like this will be prevented. Thank you again for staying with us. Sincerely,Dan Pham, Guest Service Representative.
0	Dirty. Not going here again. No coffee dirty place and bad neighborhood
1	Cool but no free wifi. Such a good trip. Being there with my fiancee to enjoy a little getaway for the weekend was perfect. We couldn't believe the view. The sunset was phenomenal and you can't imagine the sunrise. I just wish we were able to have free-wifi. Sucks to pay but they want to make a profit right Other than that the amenities sounded so great. A free bike, shuttle to downtown, and 24 hour pool. I guess that's where the extra income from the paid wifi goes too Whatever. It was sweet. We loved it and loved how friendly the staff was. They truly care about you and are always ready to help.
0	Underwhelming and COLD. When I first got in the room I didn't remove my jacket because it was so cold. The room takes forever to heat up. The blankets are very thin. They are actual blankets, not your typical hotel comforter. This would be okay IF the room wasn't a freezer. - This hotel does not care when you have issues with things which is unusual but at least other hotels try to improve your experience. - I got sick because the room was so COLD and since I had a sore throat the next morning I called for a late checkout and of course they couldn't do it. Other less important things: TV movie ordering did not work and when I called the front desk they said they would send someone and never did
0	Never again Motel 6!!!. This hotel did not meet my expectations. The room was sparsely furnished and not clean. There was a bunch of hair behind the bathroom door where staff had not cleaned the bathroom properly. The bed squeaked with every move and it was the only piece of furniture to sit on. The ceiling above us squeaked as well. No desk, no chair, no in-room coffee service, and no place to sit and relax outside. The entry door keypad was completely busted and the parking lot was deteriorating badly. Other chains have provided us far more comfort at the same price.
0	Desperate or Brave. If you stay here you are either desperate or have no where else to turn. This hotel is very aged in dire need of maintenance, cleaning, or needs to be condemned. As free wifi but did not work. Hotel smells of smoke with a very seedy crowd around it at all times of the night. Do not recommend this hotel... More
0	Poor customer service. I checked in on line and resquested an up grade. So when i arrived at Hampton Inn, Vince checked me in. I asked about my up grade n was informed,I had to da that when i reserved the room online. I told him that is what i did. Just for Vince to tell me the hotel was full.So i get to my room and i don't have a microwave or fridge. Now i have to go downstairs and see Vince. Needless to say i have less than a perfect visit. I will not be returning to this hotel again.Thanks Vince, For your lack of customer service!!!!!!In behalf of the entire management and staff, I sincerely thank you for staying at the Hampton Inn Suites Atlanta Downtown and thank you for taking a moment to do our hotel survey. We hope someday you would return and stay with us again!
0	Nice room, but dirty bathroom and filthy pool and hot tub area. The room was a great size, updated and nice. The shower/tub was dirty, and the pool area was nasty, The kids wanted to swim ( which is why we booked this hotel... for its indoor pool) , but the pool was nasty and the hot tub had what looked like sand all in the bottom of it. The chlorine was so strong, we could not even stay.Dear 874reginab,Thank you for taking the time to give our business the Wingate by Wyndham Atlanta Galleria feedback. I apologize for the inconvenience you experienced while staying at our Wingate hotel. I have discussed this situation with my entire management staff and Housekeeping staff to ensure that it is not repeated. Cleanliness is our main priority so for you to experience this inconvenience while you stayed with us is unacceptable. Our goal is to provide a level of service that requires diligent attention to detail and is a matter of constant reinforcement of our hotel. Once again, we are truly sorry for any inconvenience we caused you. If there is anything else we can assist you with in the future, please don't hesitate to call. We look forward to having you as our guest in the future.ThanksTremeil BooneFront Office ManagerWingate by Wyndham
0	Worst Experience EVER!. Bloody blankets, Mold under the carpets, and a bathroom full of leaks along the ceiling are the amenities that this hotel offered. I had to request another room because the first was occupied. The 2nd room had a strong odor with blood throughout all of the blankets, and the Chelsea and the Annex of the Chelsea are two separate hotels. One is a motel which is the Annex of the Chelsea and the other is just the Chelsea. The parking fee is charged as if it were a resort and the self parking is located 2 blocks from this motel. Your vehicle will be out in the open without security and they do not even enclose this area with a fence. Do yourself a favor and book at another place that is not here. You will Thank me!
1	Great location. Still working out a few kinks, but overall good accommodations.. Yes, it's a new location, and they are working out a few operational kinks, but their heart is in the right place. First, I loved the location. Not in the center of the tourists so we felt better immersed into the city. We were able...MoreThank you for your thorough feedback... this helps our team to believe and understand that guests certainly do care of hotel service. We pride ourselves on providing an exceptional breakfast experience and happy to read we made that expectation. With opening a new hotel there...More
1	Great Place to lay your head!. After returning from Chicago and a stay at the Hotel Allegro, celebrating my partner's birthday, I can't say enough good things about the hotel. While our check-in was a little rocky with a staff member who was a bit terse ( though solely trying to deal with what seemed to be a security issue), overall our stay was great. Staff even had candies, nuts and beer in the room, with a hand-written card waiting for us in our room, as a birthday gift for my husband. The hotel has recently been updated but stays true to its Theater district roots. Modern Art Deco design adorns throughout, while still giving this hotel an old world classy feeling. However, note standard rooms are smaller than the average sizes today, though you will have just enough space to not feel cramp.
1	Staff was superb!. Great staff at this hotel. It's in a nice location too. The hotel is dated, but I very much enjoyed the breakfast at Denny's (ask for Ceci) as Best Western will give rewards members a free breakfast or 6.00 off another breakfast entree at Denneys. Bertha was fantastic as check in. She accommodated my special requests and took me to 3 rooms to let me decide as I told her I was super picky. Pierre and Michael and Darby were also super kind and helpful. Michael is very knowledgeable about wineries. Darby helped me with restaurants, and Pierre was also helpful and offered any additional assistance he could. Pierre had coffee made SUPER early which is great as I was up at 4 or 4:30 each day. It was nice he was there to greet me and there was decaf and coffee made early. They need to update the rooms, but the business center was nice with 2 computers and the exercise room and laundry facility was all right there too--super convenient. The price was high, but I guess all the prices are high at Napa. I'd recommend the location too. Thanks!

0	Do not stay here. In addition to having to ask to be moved three times after seeing the initial condition of the room I was assigned (something I have never done in nearly 100 hotels I have stayed at), they carpet was so dirty I refused to take off my socks, the nightstand had a sticky substance on the surface and in the drawers, the furniture was old, worn and dirty, the staff was not terribly helpful and the neighborhood is in an economically depressed area and I did not feel completely safe at night being a single woman travelling alone. There are multiple signs in the parking lot warning that the hotel is not responsible for any damage or theft and I was worried about my car being broken into. Only pros- just off the highway and one of the nicest hotel gyms I've ever seen. Even so, I will NEVER stay here again! If I hadn't already paid in advance through hotels.com, I would have left immediately.
0	Not a good experience. We did the same as one of the other reviewers - booked through a deal site so we had to deal with it. This is the 1st time we've been disappointed with the location the deal site booked for us. The room was dated, but not horrible. However, I wouldn't go barefoot or put luggage on the floor. I didn't... More
1	Great conference hotel. This hotel offers everything is advertises. The rooms are spacious and well equipped. Concierge lounge access does make a difference because you have a smaller lounge and dining area that is less noisy than the ground floor facilities. Also, the continental breakfast and light dinner is more than sufficient. The front desk staff face many challenges and some handle them better than others but they all try hard. During conferences the luggage trolleys are not to be found so sort out your own luggage on check out during the busy times.Dear Journeytime SA, thank you very much to your comments and taking the time to write. We thrilled to hear that you enjoyed your stay. Wishing you safe travels. Dieter Heigl
1	Pretty hotel, make sure to book city view. This was our second stay here and I knew exactly where I wanted the location of the room to be, top floor overlooking city, I requested this with booking agent, not sure if this was passed on. The hotel changed the room to top floor but could not put us in a city view room, had one overlooking the road at the back which could be noisy at times. We were asked if we wanted to park on the road as they were full, so presume they were struggling with garage space. It was safe and saved 19 a day.The room itself was clean and large with two queen beds, table and two chairs, settee and table, fridge, safe, coffee maker, ironing facilities. The bathroom is looking old, the plug didn't stay in the bath, on the last day the sliding door was pushed back that far by the cleaning lady we couldn't get it out and the air con is very loud. Could also hearing the plumbing from adjoining rooms.The layout of the hotel is interesting as it is built on a hillside, not for people with walking difficulties. The grounds are beautiful. There is a pool with loungers, but for the size of the hotel is small.The location of Old Town is great, with plenty to see and restaurants and bars to walk to.All the staff we met were very niceJust a shame we didn't get our view as it has spoilt our previous memories.Thank you for your loyalty to Best Western Plus Hacienda Hotel Old Town. While its nice to hear you enjoyed your stay for the most part, Im so sorry we werent able to assign you to the room you desired. As Im sure you already know, there are many factors that go into room assignment such a room style, length of stay and previous guest check-out time. I hope youll give us another opportunity the next time you visit San Diego! Feel free to give my office a call so we can make sure you have the room you want. Booking direct will also guarantee the best reservation conditions. Thank you again for reaching out and leaving helpful feedback. I look forward to hearing from you. Enjoy your summer travels!

1	friendly staff, great rooms. We stayed three nights here and really enjoyed our stay. We did a mini suite and were very happy with it and with the friendly staff. Good continental breakfast, clean rooms, helpful staff, comfortable beds, felt safe...everything I look for!Dear Carol P, Thank you so much for choosing to stay at our little hotel for your visit to San Diego. Our mini suite is a great room, with the king size bed, sofa sleeper, microwave and fridge, it's both spacious and comfortable, perfect for longer stays.

We appreciate your feedback and hope to serve you again! Yours in Hospitality,MichelleFront Desk Agent
0	DO NOT STAY HERE. I understand these cabins are 75 years old so I didn't expect to walk into a 5 star facility but I did expect it to be clean, even somewhat clean would have been nice. The shower had not been cleaned AT ALL, the commode was not flushed, one bed had hair in it, the other bed had dirt in it,... More
0	Our one night at this roach mo.... Our one night at this roach motel was awful. While the manager on duty was very pleasant, our room was less than satisfactory. There was no remote for the TV. The water in the bathroom ran lukewarm in the shower and sink. Two of our towels were a gross grey color. We asked for a non-smoking room but clearly someone had been smoking in our room quite recently. Worst of all, the people on either side of us decide... view mored to stand outside and talk very loudly until midnight. They screamed, yelled, slammed doors, and stomped back and forth for two hours. When we went to check out, there was no one available. We had to leave without being properly checked out. This roach motel is not worth the money.
1	Great deal. My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for one night for the Cherry Blossom Festival in Washington this past weekend. It was more than adequate for being a place to spend the night. We liked that the room and bathroom were spacious. The location was ideal for someone who drove to the area. I believe the hotel also has a shuttle to the nearby metro station. It is a 15-20 minute drive to Washington in regular, non-congested traffic. The breakfast buffet was standard but I would really expect much for the price we paid. I like that they have their own parking lot and they are just down the street from numerous fast food establishments and a supermarket. The gentleman at the reception desk was a bit short with us and another couple who were checking in before is but nothing that is worth complaining about. Overall I would recommend this hotel as it is a good bargain and is close to highway access and public transportation.
0	DON'T EVEN TRY IT!!!!!!!!. Totally disgusting!! Room smelled of mold. Flushed the toilet and water leaked all over the floor. Went to the desk and the jerks handed me a towel and a bucket to catch the leaks!! Then they charged us twice but my bank cancelled the second charge. DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT GOING THERE!
0	Beware - Not the same under the new management. Have been coming to hotel for decades and have previously rated it highly, but it changed hands since my last stay and is now under new management pending demolition for larger hotel. All staff appears to be new. Day of arrival, called hotel en route to warn of late arrival. At first hotel telephone did not work. Finally got through... More
0	To be honest.... This is a pet friendly hotel. Having said that, it smells like a pet friendly hotel that does not get a thorough cleaning after a dog has been sick. We were booked into our first room which smelled like a mixture of beef jerky and vomit. Our second room was a little better, but we still had to go buy several candles to make the room habitable. The carpet was sticky, and the sheets were full of holes. The bathtub looked like someone took a blowtorch to a corner. The carpet in the halls is in a severe need of cleaning. Many spots and traffic patterns. The breakfast was good if you like lots of carbs. I came away feeling gross and dirty even after a shower.
1	Good Experiencie and Location. Exelent hotel with a good location for vacations or business withh a good price and service. The rooms are very confortable.

1	Great Staff-Central Location. We just had a very nice stay at Best Western Lamplighter at SDSU over the Thanksgiving week. The San Diego weather was warm and clear which was well complimented by the tropical landscaping of the hotel grounds and pool area. The hotel staff was helpful when needed without hovering and the location of this hotel when visiting family in a variety of San Diego areas was excellent. We'll stay here again!Hello Brian, We are so grateful that you took time to review us here on TripAdvisor and for the 4 star rating.

1	Great Affordable Stay in Waikiki. This is a great little boutique hotel with an excellent Waikiki location. All of the staff are friendly, attentive and very helpful. Stayed in a lovely, very quiet room and in three nights never heard any noise from adjoining rooms. Would book again and highly recommend. Thank you!Aloha Suzette777,Thank you very much for your 5 star review! We are thrilled to see that you enjoyed your stay with us. It was our absolute pleasure to have you at our hotel and your kind words will be shared with our staff. All of our staff knows that they are the heartbeat of the hotel and all love accommodating our guests, all the while showing their own unique Aloha Spirit. If your travels bring you back to Oahu please consider a second stay with us. Mahalo,Jerome YapchingAssistant Front Office Manager
1	Gets the Job Done. This hotel was perfect for us. We went to DC for a conference but went a few days early to play. The hotel has a shuttle that leaves every hour and takes you to the metro. We got around perfectly from there. The room smelled like it used to be a smoking room and they've been trying to cover it up for a few months but it was livable. The pool was a little creepy and cold at night but that didn't stop us from swimming every night. All in all a great place for the money.
0	Should have paid a bit more and stayed somewhere else. Stayed one night on Thursday 7/26. The room and bathroom were clean, although very outdated. We were assigned to a room right next to the elevator, and could hear the rings whenever someone was taking the elevator. We were forced to pay the 15 parking and suffered the long wait for the valet. Not worth it.
0	Do NOT stay at The Annex The Chelsea. The Chelsea itself is a pleasure to stay at, however, stay clear of The Annex. The Chelsea and it's owners (same as Congress Hall in Cape May) should be mortified having their name associated with this wing of the hotel. It felt like a low budget refugee motel. Upon entering our room we promptly called the front desk and had our room upgraded to the other side of The Chelsea and out of The Annex. The whole feel of the Annex was dirty, banged-up and worn out. The bathroom was something straight out of the 70's and not the boho-chic 70's. The furniture in the room was below standard and reminded me of poor garage sale finds. If The Annex underwent a huge refresher...you would have a gem on your hands.
0	Watch Out for This One. I initially reserved a room, on my own, at the Knights Inn Market Center in Dallas, Texas. The booking was completely unprofessional, with errors in the booking info. This was corrected after a couple of emails. I then inquired of the cancellation policy. The explanation was first, and I quote, before 24 hours. After inquiring of the meaning of that statement, they modified it to after 24 hours!!! Complete and utter incompetence. This was in the month of January, and my reservation was in April. I then noted the charges for the room appear on my credit card statement in January!!!! I then realized the level of incompetence, and wondered if fraud may be involved. A phone call to the Inn put me in contact with a young lady, who couldn't even find a record of my reservation. She was eventually helpful in finding it and reversing the charge to my account. She also clarified verbally the cancellation policy, which was the standard prior to 24 hours before the date of the stay. After all this, I emailed about a week ago, asking them to cancel my reservation, and confirm by email. No response, so sent a second email asking again for confirmation. No response. I have again emailed, to the attention of the young lady who helped in the past, requesting confirmation of my cancellation. Ed WooleverHello Mr. Woolever, I apologize that you had some issues with your reservation. According to our records which were emailed to you upon your request, your reservation was booked for January 21st, since you failed to checkin on January 21st you were charged for the first night. When you called us to inform us about the charge and your intention to book the room on April 21st, we thought of it as a miscommunication and as a courtesy reversed the charges immediately. Later you emailed us with your intention to cancel the room for April 21st, I emailed you back requesting you to call me for the cancellation (as it is a standard protocol for most hotel reservation cancellation to get a verbal authorization), which you called and canceled within 10 minutes. We sincerely apologize for the initial date mismatch and the charge, I hope we can go pass that and you would give us an opportunity to show you our commitment to customer service by staying with us. If there is anything I can do to persuade you to change your decision please give us a call. Thank you for your feedback, your feedback is very valuable to us since it helps us improve our services.
0	Worst stay ever. I do not recommend this hotel for anyone who values customer service or safety. The staff is not accommodating or friendly. There is a huge crime problem here and the management does not bat an eye. There is no security or concern for those staying here. The manager did not even attempt to contact us when our car was broken into on the property. Break-ins are a regular enough occurrence here that the Sheriff's office patrols at night regularly. If you value your vacation stay do not stay here.
0	It's nice for what it is, but not for us. Downtown hotel that was hard to find as entrance/parking garage is around the corner from the actual address. The sign out front is very small. Overnight parking is exhorbitant we used a garage 5 blocks away, although there are others closer by. Room was interesting L shape with view over street. Furnishings were all fine although 2 lightbulbs were burnt out. Staff was helpful, but busy. Pub next door is half the price (or less) than hotel restaurant. I noticed traffic noise, especially truck honking early in morning and siren that went by. Not a poor hotel, just not my style for visiting a city and making everything convenient.We appreciate the feedback jerryg, to make your next Seattle visit as convenient as possible I would be happy to connect you to our W Insider who can assist with local arrangements. We are glad you found our team helpful and we're working on some better signage for our entrance.

1	Excellent and Very Comfortable. I used to stay at The W hotel in Seattle but now stay at this Hyatt. Beautiful rooms, great decor, some sides of the building do have a water view, great location, easy to walk down to the Pike Market, excellent shopping and sightseeing.My only compliant was the Asian gentleman working the front desk who refused to print my boarding passes after the printer on the self serve Boarding Pass Kiosk failed, I politely asked the other Gentleman working at the front desk and he immediately printed the boarding passes for us.Excellent Property for Business or TouristHighly Recommended
0	Keep it as your last resort. I stayed in this place for 2 weeks, the staff is peculiarly rude. They don't understand the meaning of hospitality. Given the fact it's an extended stay, still the front desk, housekeeping is expected to be a little polite. On my check out day since my flight was in the afternoon I requested for an hour extension given the fact that their check out timings are 11 am, but, inspite of my requests and over looking the fact that I had already been there for 2 weeks, they rudely turned down the request. Special mention of the lady at the front desk.I recently received a copy of your review of our hotel. Our company prides itself on providing great service and great rooms at great rates, which is why I was so disappointed to read your post. Please accept my most sincere apologies.I do appreciate the opportunity to provide an explanation regarding the issue you described. I truly understand your aggravation and the inconvenience you experienced. The circumstances you have detailed are, of course, unacceptable and highly regrettable. It is our goal to provide a pleasant and relaxing environment where our guests can feel at home when theyre away from home. And we recognize that in order to achieve that goal, we must provide outstanding service. As this hotel's Manager, I have spoken with housekeeping and the rest of the staff to ensure that a situation like yours does not happen again. Let me apologize again that your stay was not completely satisfying, and assure you that we will continue to listen to our guests in forums like this one or directly (please visit our website and click the Contact Us link at the bottom of the page). I hope that you would give us the pleasure of having you as a guest again at this hotel or any other brand locations in the future.
0	Watch your bank statement. This has been a horrible experience. I was on vacation with my husband and son and this pretty much ruined some of it. At check-in, they had to cancel my existing reservation and start two new ones because my stay was supposed to be paid for with my points (points for 2 nights and pay for 1 night). I would have to check in again after my first two nights and get my key cards reprogrammed. A hassle, but I was willing to do it. They had already put a hold on by debit card for 415.74. They advised us that the hold would be released as per the manager and the money would be credited back. The hold was not released as promised and I had to spend at least an hour at the front desk the next morning trying to get it handled. I also had to call my bank and let the front desk person talk to them in order to get the release done. Our bank took the hold off of the card once they were given an authorization number. I woke up the next morning and found that this hotel had run my debit card for the 415.74 AGAIN. This transaction overdrafted my bank account. I am not even sure yet if the bank is going to charge me an overdraft fee for the hotel's mistake. It was a good thing that I had more money that I could transfer to that account or we would've had issues going to the theme parks or eating meals. My husband went down to the front desk again and had to go through the same hour long session trying to get the problem taken care of. BOTH days of this, we were late getting to the theme parks that our child had been looking forward to. They credited the card back via the bank again. The front desk said that the release of the funds from the day before has never been released as promised. We were assured by front desk personnel that the manager would be in later and that they would have him call us. He did not call us. My husband called the front desk around 5:00 that evening and we were told that the manager said he wouldn't be able to look into anything until the next day. We were flying out the next day. This stay has been the worst I have ever experienced. Very disappointed. We used Hilton Garden Inn because if their good reputation on our last two trips and have spent thousands of dollars staying with them over the last six weeks. We feel that the fact that none of the management had time for us is inexcusable and terrible customer service. We will not do it again.Thank you for sharing your experience about your stay with us. Please accept my personal apologies for the inconvenience that you have experienced during your arrival and the remainder of your stay. I certainly understand and appreciate the time you took to sharing your concerns. I have discussed your review with my Front Office staff to see where we went wrong, and to come-up with actionable strategies so that this does not happen again. We would really appreciate you giving us another opportunity to prove ourselves the next time you are in the area. We hope to see you again soon.All the Best,Debra Thompson-FrenchGeneral Manager

1	Everything we were looking for. We stayed 3 nights over Labor Day weekend 2014. My husband, daughter (6), and I were happy with the hotel, especially considering we booked on Priceline, naming our price if only 160.00 per night. This caliber of a hotel on Labor Day weekend would have cost twice that without priceline.Priceline did have us set up in a king room, but at checkin the staff was very courteous and accommodating and moved is into the largest available double room on the 7th floor. The luggage service was great, getting all of our bags to our room within 5 minutes of our arrival and also sharing perspective on local beaches that my daughter may enjoy. The room was very large (considering location) and extremely clean. We enjoyed the location and easily took a few walks to local attractions. We walked to Seaport village, Pier B to see the sand castle competition, the mall, the heart of gas lamp quarter twice or 3 times to eat and little Italy twice. Self parking across the street had a 35 dollars per day rate. We also drove to local beaches (mission, pacific, coronado) and the zoo easily getting pretty much everywhere in 25 min or less. We visited the pool one afternoon which was small but very clean with a perfect water temp and adequate for the number of folks using it. Overall the hotel was a great place to stay, extremely affordable, clean and has a wonderful location! Konrinna D,I am pleased you had a wonderful stay with us in San Diego! Here at Westin, we always do our best to accommodate your needs. Whether it is getting you in the right room to service, we strive to exceed all your expectations. Our location is also one of the most favorable aspects of this hotel - we are nestled in between a few ideal neighborhoods allowing you easy access to the Gaslamp Quarter, Little Italy, the Harbor and Seaport Village. We are also just minutes from Balboa Park.Thank you for your review and I hope to see you and your family back in San Diego again soon!Kind Regards,Alyssa TurowskiGeneral Manager
0	Bad hotel, bad location, just bad. First off there is no parking, valet is your only option which would be fine if it were a better hotel. Our AC didn't work, maintenance had to come reset it three times. Very inconvenient at 8pm, 11pm then again at 1am. The pool is a joke, it's more like a bathtub. And the amazing breakfast they advertise is no better than a Continental at most hotels. Over all it was a huge disappointment.
1	Great Experience. I booked the Jacuzzi Suite. The price was reasonable for such a room. At first they gave me a regular suite but when i went back to tell them, they apologized and promptly showed me to the right room. The staff was very friendly and inviting. The room was very clean and everything that i was expecting. The Jacuzzi tub was great. The king size bed was amazing and i slept very well. A much needed relaxation after a long drive. The only thing that i really didn't have the best experience with was the fitness room. A couple of the machines didn't work but that's not too big of a deal. Would definitely stay again.Dear donovang937,Thanks for all the compliments. I have shared your review with my staff to show them how important everyone is in creating a great guest experience. We look forward to serving you again in the future.Thanks Tremeil BooneWingate by Wyndham
0	NEVER AGAIN. Never again! The rooms comforters were stained terribly and found hair on sheets. They gave us another room and it looked the same. You get what you pay for I guess. We left and drove to another hotel
0	WHAT A DUMP ! ! ! !. THIS place was and absolute DUMP ! ! ! They are in the middle of renovating and they tried to put me in a room that had not been renovated yet. EVERYTHING AND EVERYPLACE you look the place is FILTHY ! ! ! Motel 6 would even be a better place to stay than this place ! ! ! !... More
0	Worst hotel. Nothing thing was nice worst hotel I had ever in my life

Thank you again for your time and come visit us again soon! Sincerely,Edgar RiveraGeneral Manager edgar.riveramarriott.com
1	Enjoyed our stay!. We stayed four nights at this hotel in June and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The hotel was transformed from an apartment building and used to serve mainly visitors of patients of the Virginia Mason Hospital and Medical Center. The layout of our room was a little different than the typical hotel. We had a relatively small room, a big closet,and a bothroom with a window. The staff were polite and professional. We also enjoyed the restaurant at the first floor. They have a small menu, but everything we had were very good. The servers were very friendly as well. The hotel is within walking distance to the Pike Place, Pinoeer Square, and China Town, and the Space Needle. We picked this hotel because of the reasonable price and we wanted to avoid driving in downtown. The entire stay exceeded our expectations in terms of the service we received and the overall experience.Good Morning Traveler - Thank you for being our guest in June! As you mentioned, the room layout is a little different because we were a 1930's apartment building (originally the Rhododendron Apartments). We're glad you were able to dine in our Rhododendron Caf and enjoy the sites of the city. Please come visit again and until then, safe travels!
1	Good value downtown. Seven of us flew into Seattle relatively late in the day and stayed overnight at the Four Points. The next AM we were able to use a meeting room to prepare for our business meeting in Seattle (walking distance from the hotel, in fact). While the hotel does not have a lot of frills but the kitchen was open until 10:00 and the bar until midnight and the staff was both accommodating and friendly. The hotel had a functional exercise room that is open 24 hrs (six pieces of standard equipment and a set of weights) which is adequate for the number rooms. Although ostensibly a tobacco free facility I was fairly certain that one of the previous guests smoked extensively in my room which detracted from my visit as did the noise from the ice machine directly opposite my room. The room in fact was a roomy king with a good desk with multiple power outlets. WiFi was complimentary. All in all the price was right compared to other higher end places in the neighborhood.Thank you for sharing your review. We are happy to hear you enjoyed your experience while staying with us and are glad we were able to assist you in preparing for your business meeting. We take great pride in providing our guests with a smoke-free environment and apologize for any lingering traces of smoke. We will share this feedback with the team to ensure this does not happen again. We are glad you found our team to be both friendly and accommodating and we look forward to seeing you again, Steve. Take care.
0	DO NOT STAY THERE!!!!. The hotel is simply horrible, dirty, smelly and noisy beyond belief. The sheets have not been changed when we booked the room and mould and dirt were 'dripping' out of the extractor in the bathroom. Even for 100 a night it was a torture. I stayed in the area a few years ago in the Ramada hotel which is now unfortunately closed, the hotel was simply lovely. While searching for a similar hotel, Greenwich Inn appeared, I don't know what I was thinking booking it..
0	Horrible. Location not too bad. Close to lots of restaurant. There were blood on the sheets, I informed the front desk and they didn't even come to change it.
1	Windy City Wedding. We booked our trip through Hotwire. We have excellent results through this website and this trip was no different. We arrived on a Friday morning and we treated like gold throughout our entire stay. LocationThe location is a little far from the Magnificent Mile shopping area but is totally walkable. It took us about 20 minutes to walk up Lasalle and down Wacker to Michigan. Great to get the previous nights cobwebs out of your head. In addition a short walk east on Randolf will bring you to Millennium Park which is were you can find the Chicago Bean and other great attractions. This hotel is smack dab in the middle of the Theatre District so make sure to catch a show while you are there. RoomsWe were able to stay in one of their King rooms which was amazing. We stayed in Rm 1106 and would recommend this room to anyone. It is smaller but plenty of space for clothes and amenities. The room has an iron and ironing board, huge TV and an amazingly comfortable bed. It was extremely clean throughout. Lobby and Hotel AmenitiesWe didn't spend a whole lot of time in the hotel, but it was very nice. Great lounge off the lobby for sitting and relaxing with a drink, surfing the web or finishing up some business. The bar was nice and every night from 5-6 they have free wine sampling.StaffThe front desk staff were great!!! Very helpful and efficient. The house cleaning staff was also quick and efficient and always said hello. Overall this is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed at.Thanks for the comprehensive review of our hotel LuckyPine6! I'm delighted to see there were several aspects of your stay that you enjoyed and were able to take advantage of our amenities! Thanks again for choosing our hotel and we hope to see you again in the future!Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager
1	Hyatt at the Bellevue. Awesome Place But the staff needs to work on the details!!!!This will make this a much better place! I do not think you will be able to find a better place to stay in the city if the Hyatt can fix that small area!!Ronald, thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt at The Bellevue! We thank you for your feedback and apologize for any inconvenience that we may have caused you. If you would like to speak further about your stay, you're more than welcome to contact me.We look forward to welcoming you back again soon.Kind regards,CR
0	Disappointed. Arrived and had prev reqd a king or queen suite and was given a wheelchair accessible dble. And was told that's all they had. However a couple that were friends of mine later called and made a reserv and recvd a king suite! Additionally our heat was broken all week end and it was quite chilly. They attempted to repair twice w/no luck.
0	What a Dump. We tried this motel for the first time. Seemed convenient for us to stop there for the night. From this experience, I have learned to always ask to see the rooms before I lay down my credit card. the lobby looks nice...but that was it! As soon as you open the doors to the hotel halls, there was a musty,... More
0	good place if you're not going to be in your room. It had great location and price but rooms were out dated cable was horrible no channels fuzzy couldn't hook up fire stick
1	My favorite hotel in the country. I first stayed at the Grand Hyatt Seattle soon after it opened about 8-9 years ago. I remember loving the hotel. It was new and modern and in a great location and ever since I've always loved it. I recently revisited it and was worried that it could now be showing its age. I'm happy to report that these worries were completely unfounded, the hotel is still amazing. There's a Ruth's Chris Steakhouse in the hotel, as well as a Starbucks and a sushi restaurant. The staff is very helpful. And the location is great for anything in downtown Seattle, either business or pleasure. But my favorite part of the Grand Hyatt Seattle are the rooms. They are modern and I just love the layout of them. As others have reported, the bathrooms are huge, and the whole entry area of the room has stone floors instead of carpet. The views from the upper floors are also amazing, especially on an unusual clear day. I had room service twice and each time it was good and came quickly. Overall, it's a great hotel. I highly recommend it.
0	Mistake. Don't let advertised low price on the sign fool you like it did to me. You must stay 7 days to get that price. After that it's all downhill. Room smell, don't walk around in bare feet carpet hasn't been used in months. Bathroom grease stains on floor and in tub. Sink doesn't drain. This is not a family motel... More
1	Refugees from the Napa fires. We had made a reservation for two couples on Sept 17 and had the confirmation thru Expedia/hotels.com. When we arrived...frazzled after being evacuated with my Boston sister and husband who were visiting us during this difficult time...we were told that they had no rooms due to some problem that occurs occasionally with this booking service!!! We were struggling for two hours to locate another hotel ..using both Expedia (who owed us big!) and our own efforts... and no one came thru. Just as we were going to give up, there was a shift change at Reception and our savior Lorenzo came on. Thru some magic, he was able to provide us with two lovely rooms for the night!! He is a truly charming and compassionate...an excellent employee and human being!!The rooms were nicely decorated with very comfortable beds. Old San Francisco feel! Would stay there again!Hi Alan, We were pleased to provide you with a safe refuge from the fires, and we are pleased to have provided you with suitable accommodation. If you are staying with us, or indeed any hotel, again, do consider booking directly with the hotel, and you will have much less likelihood of issues arising with your booking and with your check-in on future visits. We hope that you will visit us for a more pleasant reason in the future. Best wishes, Hotel Management
0	Understaffed - Dirty linens - Noisy. Short Staffed - Was the only one in the lobby, waited 15 minutes for the only staff member who was on the phone trying to find a reservation in the system to cancel it for someone who just made it. The caller should have been referred to the online or national call in reservation system. The hotel was sold out - perhaps Management should have thought to have more than one person on staff until midnight perhaps Dirty Bed Linens - Once in my room, was disgusted to find that one of the beds obviously had not been changed with new sheets. - Luckily it was a double queen room and the other appeared clean. The green bed covers were filthy and torn. Will not be staying at a Best Western again. Told the agent at the front desk who apologized and removed a nominal amount off the check. Travelling on business - so that really doesn't make much of a difference to me.Noisy Air Conditioning - When the under-the-window air handler came on, it sounded like an Chevy Suburban on at fast idle.Thank you for responding and providing feedback regarding your experience during your stay. I do apologize for any inconvenience we may have caused during you visit. I can assure you that we are fully staffed and two agents were scheduled for that night. Second agent left at 8:30 p.m. once things had slowed down. Unfortunately, we did receive a rush around 9:00 pm that night. I do appreciate you being patient. during that rush hour and again I apologize and hope that you will consider giving us another chance to make your stay better.
0	Never stay here again. Would not honor reservation price when checking in will never stay here again. Booked room because having major surgery a 5 am next day didn't need this stress. Tried to tell me I booked a room with one bed, not true have reservation
1	Good location, great service a satisfied guest. Two and 1/2 blocks to Union Square, two blocks to San Francisco Shopping Center and BART two blocks to the Cable Car line a good location for shopping and sightseeing. Smallish room--tastefully appointed with touches I've seen in high-end hotels--was cozy and comfortable. It's in the heart of downtown, so we expected to hear city sounds from the room, but we slept well and comfortably in a room overlooking the street. The crowning grace, though, was the excellent and helpful staff. We forgot to make dinner reservations and was out shopping, but a call to the concierge got us an 8pm table on Saturday night in a highly-rated restaurant. The front desk staff was uniformly friendly, interested in helping us enjoy our stay, and full of useful not-in-the-guidebooks information. We'd return to the hotel without hesitation.
0	BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE. The location was perfect, and the room I stayed was very clean and spacious. The majority of the staff at the front desk was helpful EXCEPT two women. (the one that usually works in the morning (Katalina), and the African lady that works at night after 11pm). Both have ghettoish attitudes, and they argue with customers. They must be miserable with their lives, but they should not take their misery out on customers. This hotel is located in one of the prime areas in Atlanta, near a few big corporations, and it's unfortunate that you have these classless women, who are both extremely unprofessional working at the front desk at this particular location. They are a bad representation of your company -- no class at all. Two bad apples ruins the bunch. I give this place two stars. Hire people more professional people with better customer service skills.
0	Nites Inn. First of all, the owner manager both are very rude. The room I stayed in was not that clean when I first checked in. There was and probably still is writing on the walls. Not only that, but there are a lot of cockroaches, semi-torn carpet, and the walls have black fingerprints that look like they have been there... More
1	Good sized room - clean and comfortable. Room was clean and comfortable. We had a room that was designed for disabled person and this gave us the extra room in bathroom which was a bonus, after most of the tiny bathrooms we have had during our trip. Our key kept becoming unusable and needed us to go back down to reception to have it re-programmed which was a pain. Breakfast was very ordinary. The downside of the sleeping was that it is very noisy, lots of street noise on 2nd floor, and an air-conditioner that kept cutting in and out all night. Very low signal for wi-fi although it did work.
0	Under construction. The room was adequate but the breakfast was terrible. First the space is under construction. There is no room to sit. They did not keep the food stocked. So if you came late there wasn't much to eat. The hotel was overpriced for the condition it is in at the moment. Find another place to stay.Dear Valued Guest, Thank you for investing your time in reviewing our hotel. We appreciate your feedback and concerns, as they are significantly valuable to us. We do apologize about the inconvenience that was caused during your stay. Please know that these issues are being addressed with our staff so that we can improve our amenities and service to future guests. We hope that you would be so kind as to give us another chance and stay with us again, in the future. Thank you again for reviewing our hotel.
0	Tripped out experience. This place is a dump! It rides off the coat tails of being haunted, but I guess the only ghost here is the maintenance person. The place has everything antique, but that's no excuse for having crappy accommodations. The bathroom towel rack is secured with a piece of wire. Also, despite the king size bed headboard being beautiful, you can... More
0	Busy hotel that's too busy for its guests. Being both a Marriott Rewards Platinum Member and Hilton HHonors Diamond for me means that I spend over 200 nights a year in hotels, it has also given me a keen insight into what makes for a perfect hotel stay. Unfortunately the Renaissance Waverly Hotel in Atlanta falls short of delivering even an acceptable hotel stay. When I arrived at the hotel there was no bellman available to assist me with luggage. There was a line at check in with only two people at the front desk. The line moved slowly but when my turn came I was greeted nicely and welcomed as a Platinum Elite. I was also grated my requested upgrade. The suite that I had was nice although the furnishings and carpet were heavily worn. The table in the room had terrible scuffs and was made worse by an attempted cover up with magic markers. The carpeting beside the windows was fraying terribly, the robe that was in the closet was pilling to such a bad extent, it should have been thrown out! I called the front desk and was told someone would be up to look at the problems but no one ever came. One afternoon I asked for the shuttle to take me to a nearby establishment but when the shuttle van driver looked up the address I was told it was zero point two 0.2 mikes further than the 3 mile radius and despite not being busy at all, my request was refused. Instead I was pointed in the direction of a cab and told I had to pay myself if I wanted to go there. All in all it just seemed the entire staff were too busy doing nothing and were simply counting the hours until they were off. On day of checkout I informed the manager on duty of all my issues and as compensation I was offered 10,000 reward points. It's now been two months and I am still waiting for those points. The Cobb Galleria area is now more popular than ever due to the opening of the new stadium, and while this hotel is definitely very close by, there are many other hotels equally close that are far better choices for anyone coming to this area.
1	Ok location, room comfortable but small. I chose to stay here because I had a great flash offer for 3 nights- this was my first trip to Chicago. The hotel is welcoming and comfortable but I hate the fact that if you are not a member of their rewards program you have to pay extra for wifi. In room service- food was deliciious and promptly brought. Fitness centre is small but Ok- fresh fruit available here. Front office staff variable- many were new and knew nothing much- best knowledge came from bus drivers- they were great. Hotel has a shuttle bus that will drop or pick up anywhere within a mile- however Polk on Pink train line is only 5 mins walk from the hotel. Nice to be away from downtown bustle but easily accessible. Hotel is near Little Italy area and bus can also drop you in Greektown for easy dining options. Parking across the road for 13 a night.
1	A well kept secret. We chose Bienville House because of its great location and the ability to walk the French Quarter, little did we know what a delightful experience staying there would be.It started with a call to the front desk to ask specific driving directions which were given cheerfully, concise and very easy to follow. Then when we arrived great valet service for the car, well worth the money with such limited parking in the area, fantastic recommendation for a PoBoy at Johnny's two blocks from the hotel...authentic and delicious. Everyone was friendly, smiling and helpful no matter their jobs or shifts...amazing to create such consistency of service.Excellent continental breakfast with great pastries and breads, cereals plus yogart and fresh apples. The room was a lovely king with a small balcony on the courtyard...quiet which is unbelievable in the French Quarter and lovely place to relax from the busy street. We highly recommend and would return there.Dear Laura,We're so glad to hear you had such a wonderful stay with us! Thanks for sharing your experience! We hope to see you again on your next visit to New Orleans!
0	Absolutly Dirty. The room was absolutely horrible. It stunk an was hidious slept on couch because bed look like sheets never been washed. Do not stay here for your own health.
0	Should Have Spent 30 More. I should have reviewed the Robbins more carefully before making my reservation. I would have been far happier spending 30-40 more a night (and I am a THRIFTY traveler!). First of all, the room is not up to code: there was no smoke alarm. The A/C unit barely worked (probably because the filter needs a cleaning BADLY) and there isn't... More
0	OLD !. We've stayed here many times over the years. Its going down hill fast. The new management only see . My wife almost stepped off into a large hole in the front of the building while looking at the construction. (LARGE, DEEP hole, not a pothole.) No barricade. OSHA would fine the hect out of the contractor should they see it.... More
1	Great hotel, Great Staff, Great Location!. My girlfriend and I stayed at your hotel this past weekend, Saturday November 19th. I have stayed in many different hotels in San Diego (I live in Orange County so we travel there a lot to get away) and I must say I was very impressed and happy with the level of service that we received. We went down to San Diego to celebrate my girl's birthday and am very glad we chose your hotel. I purchased my reservation through Expedia so I was a little unsure of what to expect especially given the price for the room we stayed in. Your hotel surpassed my expectations. I will definitely be coming back to your hotel (probably for New Year's) given it's location and because we were treated so well. Joe at the front was very helpful and helped me out when I was trying to schedule a message from the in room services..please thank him. The only small complaint I have was that the room wasn't ready when we got there (wasn't ready till about 4) but I was allowed to check out a little late so that more than made up for it. Thank you again for the awesome service...your staff is great!
1	Great experiences or the family-excellent value!. Extremely pleased with our hotel stay. We are a family of 5 and recently spent 2 nights at this hotel. I was pleasantly surprised at the size of our suite and the friendliness of the staff. There is a popcorn machine in the lobby, which my kids loved. We also caught the staff setting out warm chocolate chip cookies in the evenings-YUM! Such a nice homey touch! The free breakfast was outstanding. We traditionally don't expect much from a hotel spread, but this one was the exception. Lots of selections, and the hot options changed from one morning to the next. Breakfast attendant was friendly and helpful, and kept everything well stocked as the crowd ebbed and flowed. The only negatives were an extremely loud family in the room above us that kept us awake until almost midnight. The hotel staff did they best to help and even offered to move us, but we opted not to take them up on the offer. Nothing else the staff could have done to help that situation. I was also disappointed that the hot tub wasn't working, but the kids had a wonderful time in the pool regardless.
1	Gorgeous hotel, perfect location...best kept secret!. My husband and I stayed for the second time at the Best Western Hacienda Hotel in Old Town, San Diego for a quick weekend getaway. We had such a great time...we are loyal customers to this hotel. The staff is very friendly, and the location is ideal. It's so great to be able to just park your car once, and be within walking distance to Old Town, with lots of shopping and restaurants like Fred's. We had a gorgeous view, with a perfect room with a nice balcony, overlooking the pool. It's a nice, quiet hotel, even while being over the pool! The decor is nice, and the lack of noise was amazing. Even with a wedding reception going on below, we still slept great!
0	Never ever stay here.. This was the most disgusting hotel I have ever had the misfortune of checking into. I had come to Orlando to meet with my sister who was flying in from the UK, she and I had not seen each other in 3 years and it was to be a great vacation with each other. Checked in, and 30 minutes later checked out. This hotel had cockroaches, the room we were given was filthy, a visiting prostitute went to the room next door whilst we stood and watched. 3 attempts to gain entry to our room resulted in the handy man coming with master key. And to add insult to injury the dirt and grime was so thick it made me ill. There was one wash cloth, one hand towel, and 2 bath towels. The toilet seat was cracked, and it was supposed to have been a disabled access room. I could not enter the bathroom in my wheelchair. I have reported the hotel both to the Wyndham group, and also to hotel licensing of Orange county Orlando. This place needs condemning.
1	Pleasantly surprised!. Driving into the small parking lot of the hotel, I wasn't sure what to expect. It looked like they really tried to give a garden feel to it with hanging succulents and different plants all around. I arrived at 11, too early to check in but they let me park in their lot for the 15 (wish it were included),. The parking area is small but backing in helps. I have a Jeep Cherokee and had no problems. The room was small but clean and cute. I was there for a bachelorette party and fake diamond rings were hidden around the room, so I can attest to the cleanliness since 9 girls looked for rings in almost every inch of the room. One downside of the hotel was being woken up a couple different times by sirens and honking but it is the downtown area. Breakfast was very nice- pancakes, sausages, eggs, different breads and muffins, cereal, yogurt, granola, fruit, almond milk, teas and coffee. There was a waffle maker but I didn't see batter. The woman working in the breakfast area was very efficient and helpful. They had a nice little seating area outside and tables and seats outside some of the rooms. The hotel was walking distance to everything we did, maybe a 10 min walk. I would stay again. Hi Ms Ana N,Our entire team at Best Western Cabrillo Garden Inn would like to thank you for staying at our property. It felt good knowing that you had a wonderful and pleasant stay. We look forward for your next visit to San Diego.Best!YChen
1	Not a bad choice for Orlando Airport. We stayed at this hotel after a recent renovation. Outside of new carpeting, I'm not sure what has been renovated. Still, at 60/night on Priceline it was a great value. Our room was a king suite with a separate sitting room that included a widescreen LCD TV, small refrigerator, coffee maker (with Starbucks coffee packets) and sofa. The bedroom also had a TV, but it was not a flat screen.My main complaint with this hotel is that there is no free internet access in the room (it is 9.99/day). There is free internet access in the business center (which is actually 2 computer terminals near the lobby), but they can be hard to get on in the afternoon.Parking is free, and the hotel is very convenient to the airport with a free shuttle.All in all, not a bad place as long as you don't overpay.

0	Overpriced, basic amenities missing. We'd made our reservation a week ahead, but when we arrived, we had to wait for someone to return from unexpected business to the office. When we inquired about AARP or other discounts, we were told No, we don't do that. However, Senior Citizen Discount is on their brochure. We also were overcharged from the rate that we were quoted...

0	Good Location. That's the only good thing going for it.. The hotel is crazy outdated with comforters literally dating back to the 1960's (and haven't been washed since). The first room that we checked into had spots of blood on the shower curtain, one wall, and ceiling fan, and a pubic hair perfectly placed on the bathroom towels. I asked the man at the front desk to come with me... More
1	A Perfect Hotel for a Perfect Getaway!!!!!!. My husband and I just returned from a five day trip to Waikiki - my first time there, and we were thrilled with our choice to stay at Aqua Ocean Tower Hotel. We would definitely stay there again! As many others have already mentioned, the staff is like none other I've EVER met in a hotel. We felt like family in just a few short days. They even hugged us good-bye when we left!! Every single staff member that we encountered greeted us with a big smile, hello and answered many questions that we had about dining, directions, tips, souvenir ideas, sightseeing, etc. They offered to special order us our favorite donuts to be delivered first thing in the morning when their breakfast pastries were delivered. They set aside our favorite pastries for us while we went shopping so they wouldn't all get eaten up during the continental breakfast. We had a late flight out and they allowed us to check out as late as possible during the day and then still extended us the option to come back later in the day if we got tired to stay in their complimentary room. They showed us one of the completed newly renovated rooms, which is just lovely. It has a modern, asian look and feel to it. Very beautiful! I cannot wait to come back and stay in one of the new rooms! They said the renovations were supposed to be completed this summer, but things have been put on hold for now and they're not sure yet when all the renovations will be done. The walls are a little thin and one night our neighbor had his tv up way too loud all night. At about 3 am we finally called the front desk and they immediately took care of the problem. They went to our floor and discovered that there were actually about four rooms near us that all had loud tvs. They contacted all rooms by phone, except for one, and the security guard took care of the other room. We slept like babies the rest of the time!! Leonor, the manager, made me a beautiful purple lei to take with me as a souvenir from our trip and stay there. If you're unsure about whether or not this would be a good place to stay, I can assure you you'll be glad you stayed there. It's only one block from the beach. It's very clean and there are two Great restuarants at the hotel next door - the Tiki Grill and Wolfgang Puck Express. We ate at both places twice, they were that good and with very reasonable prices, too. Tiki Grill was a bit more expensive with a beautiful ocean view, but we just ordered several appetizers. The coconut shrimp was awesome and they had very good salmon. We had the Asian Noodle Salad at Wolfgang Puck, which also has an ocean view, but they also have great pizzas and sandwiches. For parking, we kept our car at a garage about a block 1/2 away from the hotel for only 8/day instead of 15/day at the hotel. You won't disappointed if you stay here!!!
1	solid hotel, very close to airport. Great choice for hotel close to airport. Clean rooms, easy to check in and out, close to restaurants and quick 5 minute drive to airport. Had a rental car so don't know about shuttle service to airport.Please accept my appreciation for your wonderful feedback regarding your recent stay at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport. I was so pleased to know we were successful in meeting your needs and expectations especially with the clean rooms, easy check in and check out and the closeness of our location to the airport . We strive to reach this goal for all our guests and seems we were able to achieve this during your stay.We do look forward to the opportunity of welcoming you back soon!

1	Excellent service and room!!!. A huge thank you to Nicole, who was super efficient in finding a group of badly prepared friends, Wineries that stay open after 4pm at 15h50!!!! She was not phased at all, went online and found some AMAZING options within 10 minutes drive from the hotel. This is the hotel you want to stay in if you want to visit wineries that are still open after 4pm. The hotel rooms were huge with loads of space and big beds. More importantly there is a hot tub and pool that closes at 10pm. So after a day in the sun, it is a fantastic option. The hotel has a Denny's attached but also an iHOP within 2 minutes walk across the road. However, the hotel offers a substantial breakfast 'snack' of yogurt, cereal bars, fruit, tea, coffee and juice. Again, thank you Nicole for your professionalism, beautiful smile and calm approach! Thank you for your feedback! We appreciate your business and hope to see you again!
0	Would not stay at motel again. I stayed at the Best Western for one night on business. The floor was dirty. It had not been vacuumed well. There were crumbs on the carpet. There was also what looked like the wing of a cockroach (or some kind of similar insect) on the inside of one of my folded towels. Additionally the phone did not work, so I could not use it to call out or to receive a wake-up call. I would not stay at this motel again or recommend to others.
1	Coming Home. Always feels great to come back to this Hotel. Karla,Front Desk and Carlos,Chef, immediately recognized me as a frequent customer and made sure all my needs were taken care of.Once I realized that I forgotten my I Pad charger, they were both quick to let me know where I could find a replacement. Both of them are clear examples of Hospitality at its best!.Best Hotel for business near the airport! Don't search for more.Dear Ramon-33126,Welcome Back to our hotel. I was very pleased that you choose us once again, even though you have so many choices in the Airport area - we truly appreciate your loyalty and continued support. I thank you for your kind compliments about Karla and Carlos, please be assured I will pass on your comments onto them during the next staff meeting. I will share your comments with my team to reinforce that we are on the right track of keeping our culture alive.Thank you for making the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport your home away from home, we hope to be welcoming you back again soon. Sincerely,Alex BlancoGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando International Airport
0	Great Staff. The staff there were really good and the rooms comfortable. Hotel looks tired and its location good It was not too far from all things considered the likes of San Francisco, Napa Valley just to name a few
0	Don't ever stay here. Place is not clean. There were bugs in my room. The couches and walls were dirty. Glasses in the room were dirty. They did not pick up my dirty towels or make my bed. The manager contacted me and the staff still did not do...More
1	Pleasant visit. Pleasant visitI stopped in here to wait for an arriving guest from the airport--with time on my hands I went to the Pool Bar where the nicest English Gentleman named Wayne took great care of me-his whole attitude of Grand customer service and winning demeanor were palpable !! Never have I felt so well taken care of on an impromptu visit --ANYWHERE- He was courteous and funny and just full of JOY.-obviously loves his work. The Hilton properties are always sparkling clean and well appointed-obviously someone knew what they were doing when they hired this individual!!Stayed March 2017, traveled with familyThank you on behalf of the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport team for your kind comments on our performance, and I am glad you had a wonderful experience during your recent visit. We appreciate you recognizing Wayne for his excellent service. He truly makes a difference at our hotel. I am proud to recognize his passion at our next staff meeting in front of his peers, and congratulate him for doing such a great job. We hope to have the pleasure of welcoming you back soon. Sincerely,Michael GoldwasserGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport
0	Bugs everywhere, sadly falling apart, great location. A transient welfare hotel without amenities of any kind, but once a week, non-scrub housekeeping. No elevators despite 5 floors, no handicapped access, despite ADA laws. A non-responsive corporate office for this multi state, chain of single rooms rented by the week is less than 5 miles away, at Paces Ferry Rd., so there's no excuse. They don't return calls or emails.Most employees here are pleasant, but as we all know, one incompetent individual can bring down a hard earned reputation. Reservations were not recorded by the woman, and repair orders went weeks unacknowledged, including toilet overflowing issues, electrical hazards of broken sockets and short circuiting of outlets and kitchen burners. Thankfully, we rarely cooked. Good restaurants chains in the area are a plus. No air conditioning in the room or repair effort in six months. Must be owned by a billionaire I'd suppose, since rooms lay vacant and Ms. Murphy has no problem sassing the guests or playing the slumlord.Holes in the walls, the room was infested with bed and other bugs, mice. A dirtier room I had never seen before. A few hired hands, paint, steamer, laundry bug spray clean up a place well, if you need a good location, at a cheap price, which is what we did. Your own stuff, can make it comfortable for an extended stay. Security personnel, Miss Melanie and manager are excellent, polite, reputable and we never had any valuables go missing during a year using this Piedmont Circle facility.
0	Awful. I had booked at this hotel for 2 nights. I arrived to check in and was told that there was no reservation in my name (even though I had the confirmation number showing the reservation) and that the hotel was fully booked . The clerk tried blaming it on the booking company and then told me I should have booked through the hotel directly and that it was my fault for using a booking company. However I'm prerty sure the hotel jusy over booked on purpose. She didn't offer me any help at all so my 3 kids and I were stranded in an unfamiliar town with no where to go and a dying cell phone. She didn't offer any apology nor did she offer to call other hotels to help us find a room or offer any kind of information about where to go. Worst customer service ever. Stupidly small parking lot (that does not look safe at all). I would avoid this hotel!!!! We ended up going to a hotel close to this one (Pacific View Inn.....NOT to be confused with the Pacific Shores Inn)....even though that hotel was full too, the man working there took the time to help me out and made some great suggestions. I do apologize for the mistake of my hotel and your reservation. I will stress the importance of taking care of every person, whether a guest or not. I will use these comments in my next training meeting. Thank you for letting me know about your experience.
1	Comfortable stay, great location!. Stayed here on my last night in Hawaii. The room was very clean and comfortable. Location of hotel was excellent. Love that they give a reusable water bottle during your stay. Service at check in could have been a little more informative but every other employee I encountered was friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay here again! Hi kukla78,Thank you for sharing your review of your experience with us at Hyatt Centric Waikiki Beach. We're glad that you got to enjoy a memorable last night in Honolulu at our central location. The team appreciates your positive feedback and we hope to continue to serve you on future visits to the island. Mahalo!
0	Does not measure up.. My first and last stay at this property. I have stayed at several Courtyard's and this one is sadly lacking. Very disappointing. Upon check-in I was given a room that wreaked of cigarettes. I should have noticed it as I got off the elevator as it was evident in the hallway. Very disappointing. The front desk did apologize and provided... More
1	SF Vibe. This the first time to San Francisco that I have not stayed in the area of Fisherman's Warf, and the Hotel Vertigo has changed my perspective of San Francisco. The Warf is a great area, but it is all tourists. When we go to SF, we like to walk (a lot) and visit the places the locals go. The Hotel Vertigo is in a great location for branching out all over the city. And, on those days when you just want to hang out - there are plenty of restaurants and bars within blocks. Hotel Vertigo is a seven story boutique hotel. Over the last couple of years I have made the decision to only stay in boutique hotels, and Hotel Vertigo does not disappoint. The rooms are small, but very well appointed. It is apparent that my room had recently been renovated with modern chic. The bathroom was huge with a great rain shower head. The room was on par with some of my recent stays in Madrid and Mexico City. Excellent WiFi coverage all over the hotel. My only complaint was that I had an inside corner room (709) on the 7th floor that adjoined another room. The door to the adjoining room was not very sound proof so I almost clearly heard TV and conversation in the next room. This was only a problem one night for about an hour before a fell to sleep after a long day of exploring the city. The staff here are amazing. They were always ready to help us with directions, taxis and recommendations. The rooms are cleaned very quickly each day with great detail. My friends have been staying at Hotel Vertigo for years and I'm glad they convinced me to stay here this time. I'll be back in a few months with my girlfriend and I know she will love the Hotel Vertigo. Dear Cortesokc,Thank you very much for your comprehensive review of your experience in San Francisco while staying at the Hotel Vertigo. I'm delighted that took advantage of our location and neighborhood feel along with the wonderful interactions you had with the Housekeeping and Front desk staff. We look forward to you returning with your girlfriend to the Hotel Vertigo!Regards,Luis Morales
1	The best place on the San Diego Beach. Great place to stay!After 7 trip to San Diego beach area it was the best hotel. And the area is wonderful with great restaurants and bar. The room is perfect, and the pool and hottub were very clean and very beautiful. I reccomand to all people that are visiting San Diego. The boardwalk is just in front of the hotel, and for sure you will feel the life on the beach like people of San Diego.Thank you for giving OPI such an great review.Glad to hear you had a good time during your stay and enjoyed the amenities.Thanks for spending time at Ocean Park Inn. Hope to have you back soon.
1	Location, Location, Location. This place is so well located, you can take the blue line from the airport straight here and its a 4 min walk, with no changes.You are also so close to the river and next door to Les Miserables show at the moment, its easy to get around by walking or on the bus from here.Rooms are nice and free prosseco goes down well every day at 5pm.Great Art Deco feelHighly recommendedHello! We truly appreciate you taking the time to provide your comments. The Allegro is fortunate to have such a convenient location to share with all of its guests to make city livin' easy. Our staff (and complimentary Prosecco) will always be here to welcome you back!
1	Nice place to have event. I really enjoyed my week at the conference center and hotel. The service was good for the most part. Arthur is an amazing service provider and very eager to help patrons have a good experience. I really liked the conference center. The rooms are comfortable and the snacks were good. I'd like to see a little more protein in any and all good that is provided. The bathrooms were nice and the staff very easy to work with. I would recommend anyone to enjoy the conference center for training or event. The parking is decent and cost is a little high.Thank you for taking the time to share details from your recent visit with us. We are delighted that you enjoyed your stay but even more thrilled that you shared your experience with the thousands of visitors to Trip Advisor each day.
0	No haba chinches. Norman Bates fundo este sitio, seguro. Sucio y ruidoso, si, es un hostel, pero he estado en muchos y este se lleva la palma en sentido negativo, por suciedad, organizacin, etc. Solo merece la pena su ubicacin, que si que es realmente buena.
1	Nice for a quick night!. Got a great rate on priceline for 45 for night. Reg rate was 109 which I would still pay!Room was nice and inviting, very bright, the carpet felt nice and comfortable. Bathroom was large with jetted tub and seperate shower area. Bed was nice and comfy!!24 hours coffee/tea/cookies in lobby. We used the gym in the AM while small was more then enough. Only one bike and elliptical machine. Did have a pool that we did not use. All staff we encountered from front desk to housekeeping in the hall were all pleasant and greeted us.Would stay here again in Orlando however we usually stay more towards Disney/Universal.Dear guest Bucky101, I would like to thank you for your comments on your experience on your last stay. We know that when traveling our guests have many options to choose from and we value and deeply appreciate your loyalty and support. Your comments have been communicated to all our associates and posted in our bulletin board as a reward for a job well done. We are looking forward to welcome you, family and friends to once again provide you with an outstanding level of service and nothing less. Sincerely,Alex Blanco
0	Wouldn't recommend. The room was ok. The hall way was under construction so we heard constant banging all night. One of the hotel staff just walked into our room no knocking and then stared at us blankly asking if we had checked in. The wifi didn't work the front desk gave us a 1800 number to call so we could ask them to reset it. I would not stay here again.
1	Great trip to San Francisco. My husband and I go to San Francisco frequently to visit our son. This was the first time that we stayed at the Orchard Garden. The room was nice, the friendliness and service was even better. We always enjoy a walk through China Town which made to location of the hotel very convenient for us.I'm so pleased that you and your husband finally got a chance to stay with us, Terry! I couldn't agree more that a walk through China Town is a must while visiting San Francisco, so I'm glad that you enjoyed our proximity to the gate. I hope we'll have the pleasure of seeing you the next time you're in town!All the best,Collins C., Front Office Manager
0	Very noisy stay. This is old hotel located on a loud main road. Don't look for a good nights sleep here because of the noise from cars racing up and down the street. Other noise makers were the garbage truck is there at 7:00 am and someone was running a jack hammer around the same time. The curtain was ripped. Trim limbs falling on cars. The pastries for the continental breakfast were stale and only bananas were there for the fruit. Coffee taste like old motor oil.Dear Janet,Thank you for taking a moment to provide your valuable feedback. We would like to apologize that your stay did not meet your expectations or our standards. We are truly sorry the outside noise level was distracting. We will certainly look into your concerns regarding breakfast and the parking lot tree limbs as our goal is to provide each guest with a safe and enjoyable experience. Again, thank you for your time and feedback.
1	Remodel of lobby. Other than the fact that there was no real lobby this hotel was comfortable and clean. I was unaware that they were in the middle of a lobby remodel which made arriving and departing in the rain a hassle.Dear guest Jan S:I really appreciate your taking the time to share your disappointment with your recent stay. I want to personally apologize for the inconvenience that you experienced during your arrival/departure due to our renovation. Im happy to announce that we are back to a beautiful lobby for all our guests enjoyment and we would love to welcome you again to show you our final product.We value you as a guest, and I do want you to know that your concerns are our concerns!. Please stay with us again soon so that we can demonstrate our commitment to exceed your satisfaction. Sincerely, Alex BlancoGeneral Manager
0	Mold Alert!!!. The most miserable dump I've ever had the misfortune to step into in my entire life. Let me tell you why. Spoiler: It ends with this being a mold dump. The paint on the door is peeling. Door opens and we're slammed with a wave of moldy smell that's mean as hell and thick as grass. We're dead tired and we assume that maybe we just need to run the AC or maybe we just need to leave the door open for a bit. (The door needs to be shoved closed by the way.) The light in the bathroom buzzes like a chain saw and a quick shower ends with stained towels. Or maybe they were just dirty. Early wake up the next day and we come back to the same rancid smell. I investigate and realize there is clear water damage everywhere!!! Bu the door, in the bathroom, all over the ceiling. Thrown in damaged furniture and a sink that's falling apart and you really have an A+ dump. All this on top of a real health hazard. We checked out and went somewhere else at like 11 PM.
1	What a view. I attended a conference for 4 days. The room was ideal for what I needed. The upgrade to a suite allowed for business to take place in my room without a bed in the middle. The bathroom was fantastic as noted by others. I enjoyed the fitness area, although a little confined relative to the size of the hotel and the fitness-minded Seattle population. The cab ride isn't bad and is under 50. I had colleagues that did the train for much less money and minimal trouble. Walking distance to great restaurants and the riverfront made the location very convenient.
0	Dirty, poorly maintained, seamy activity in lobby. There's a newer Ramada closer to the airport, but because Ramada appears to be all franchise, you never know what you're getting, and this was bad. Our reaction confirmed by a fellow traveler, returning from Ecuador, the next morning -- her bathroom had pipes leaking brown fluid in wall. A woman possibly seeking trade was buying beers from the shop... More
1	Enjoyable Stay. Stayed here due to flight change and required a hotel for one night. Joined the membership program that offers a cheaper rate. Early check in was permitted and much appreciated after overnight flight, the front desk/ check in staff were fabulous with a friendly and informative attitude. We stayed in a corner suite room that was spacious and well appointed with a separate living area and large bedroom that also had a really nice bathroom with shower and bath. It was a lower floor overlooking the pool area-the pool itself was a shallow toddler type design with a slightly deeper jacuzzi attached. It was still popular with sunbathers but unfortunately you can't actually swim. The hotel had live loud music the night we stayed and was clearly audible until around 1030 at night. Higher floors or a room on opposite side of pool would avoid this. Overall a great stay here and even though it didn't have a balcony I'd definitely stay here again. The bed was super comfortable so a great night's sleep was achieved. Hi Nathan T,Thank you for sharing your review of your experience with us at Hyatt Centric Waikiki Beach. We're glad you enjoyed an overall great stay and appreciate your comments on our well appointed guest rooms and fantastic service. The team looks forward to welcoming you back again soon and wish you all the best in your travels.
0	Horrible customers service bedding. Well I thought for the price rate at the least you would get a good comfortable bed and a more professional look to bedding it looked so unprofessional who puts the pillows over the top comforter it makes me feel like the bed was sleep in . The office manager scott i think thats his name was very very rude... More
0	Waste of Good Money. This location was little more than a hotel 6 at 4 times the cost. Very disappointed with the accommodations. I choose Best Western as they have always been a great hotel...not this time. There seemed to be a bit of attitude because this is the wine country There are a lot of choice...choose wisely.
0	kathleen britton. I have stayed at days inn in the past this was the worst stay I have ever had I am disabled my friends were to stay close by to help me that is the way the rooms were rented that is not what happened they were put upstairs no air conditioner no phone hook up and maintence said what do you want for 40 dollars the worst stay I ever had the front desk girl 2nd shift very rude not acceptable
0	Beware!!!!. Filthy hotel! Bed bugs or fleas, not sure which but we scratched all night. Dirty rags, dirty tub, nasty carpet and sheets. Should have been tipped off when I had to wade through trash overflowing the trash can in the breakfast area. Mgr. wouldn't return phone calls (3) and when I finally reached him, he said he'd give me 10.... More
1	Overnight stay. Stayed at the Marriott for one night to go to the United Center for the Mary J Blige Concert. The staff was amazing and very accommodating. We dined in the hotel and ate handcrafted burgers and fries that was very delicious.The most accommodating part of our stay was the shuttle to and from the United Center. The driver drove us directly to the entrance of the stadium. The concert let out at 12pm and the driver was waiting or us!!!! The shuttle normally only runs until 9pm I believe but if they have guests that are attending an event the offer shuttle service too then they will stay available until the event is over. That is very accommodating for someone who may not have driven to the hotel or wants to avoid parking fees. The hotel was clean and very welcoming. The staff was very friendly and talkative too.
1	Wonderful family hotel for Las Vegas. We had a wonderful stay at the Suncoast our hotel room was facing the pool and the views were absolutely perfect. It's very nice to visit Las Vegas and kind of get out of the rat race of downtown. Nice location about 20 minutes from the strip. Hotel was very clean plenty of stuff for the kids to do also the arcade was inexpensive and the gentleman that work there was very helpful. The pool area was beautiful and they also have bowling with tons of lanes and a movie theater which neither did we get to explore. We were there to visit family and kind of busy running around. I would Highly recommend this hotel to people visiting with kids to Las Vegas. Pictures are Views from our room 455. The only reason I did not give it an excellent is because you have to walk through the casino to get to the hotel room and you feel like you smoke a few cigarettes by the end of the Walk. I'm not a cigarette smoker
1	Wonderful Experience! Beautiful Hotel!. We booked the Hyatt for our weekend in Seattle to see Steve Martin and Martin Short.The hotel is dog friendly and in walking distance of the Paramount theatre where the show was at.The parking isn't the best here but it's Seattle, so it's expected. We paid 35 for overnight parking. Once you get parked just walk everywhere, I love walking around Seattle.The only complaint I had was the pet fee changing from the time I booked it until the time we actually stayed. The fee had gone up 50. I didn't complain or say anything because I just didn't feel like having a dispute about it. I also wish they'd had an area for the dogs to do their business, luckily I always carry poop bags, but my Dog had to go very suddenly on the street because I couldn't find a green space close enough, so I just picked it up of course.I guess with big cities it's harder to have an outdoor area for pets.Now to all the great things, which was pretty much everything.The lobby was beautiful, nice lighting, everything was clean, there were large hallways and huge ceilings.Our check in was quick, easy and friendly.We were given a room on the 29th floor with a great view of the city.The room had huge windows, it was a really clean room, spacious and beautiful.The bed was really comfy and also very clean.The Bathroom was massive and I really mean that, it has a gorgeous soaking tub, walk in shower, toilet and vanity area. You have lots of amenities with this hotel.There is a nice hallway space and an awesome do not disturb button that turns a light on and you don't have to hang something on your door, loved that.We had food and drink options that were attached to the hotel in the front, which is always nice for a quick and easy option.We ordered room service with our TV remote. The breakfast that came was delicious, very prompt and with friendly service.We slept amazingly with the fantastic bed and black out shades.When we came back into our hotel on the Saturday afternoon/evening before the show we got on the elevator with a Seattle Mariner, that was pretty cool.Everything about our experience here was perfect from the moment we arrived to the moment we sadly left.This was a bit of a splurge but I hope that one day we can stay here again.I also wanted to add that every staff member I encountered was always friendly to myself, my DH and our Dog.Thanks for a great weekend in Seattle for the show.
1	Ritz on the park. Stayed at the Ritz for 3 nights last weekend with husband and daughter. The club level service was amazing, as was service all over the hotel, from the check -in to the door men to the people who cleaned the room. I used the concierge several times, and was able to get into a restaurant that showed up as nothing available on Open Table by using the Ritz' contacts.The club had (alcoholic) drinks available all day , or at least every time we stopped. The bites sized portions served at the pre dinner hour were plentiful and had great variety.Breakfast was nice. Would have been nice to include an egg option,maybe scrambled eggs or something. We had bagels with smoked salmon or oatmeal most mornings. The coffee was good as well.The only thing that was not perfect was that each bed nobly had to flattened out down pillows on it , so we asked for a couple extra which were brought up immediately with a smile.Thank you to the Ritz for a memorable stay !
1	Nice modern hotel. Very clean modern hotel with a nice bar on the main floor. They even had a band playing one night. Room was a good size , my only complaint was there wasn't a mirror in the bedroom area , only by the bathroom. Great location, within walking distance of everywhere we needed to go to. The Livealoft program is a great free concert series at most aloft's, so happy you got to enjoy that bit of local flavor while here. Be sure to check for concerts in your area at your local aloft. Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations
1	BEST SERVICE. I will say, check in was an adventure. I had read some reviews that had issues with check in and we sure had some too, but the staff more than compensated for this and I would still give full marks for the property and its people. Im going to single out Evan at the front desk and Lisa who is one of the restaurants servers. amazing service. Its nice to feel welcome in any hotel or resort, but these two staffers in particular really did make a great impression with their attention to customer service and great attitudes. It's not just the property that brings people back, it the people for sure and we will gladly return!Dear jjbozzi, Thank you for taking the time to review your experience at Estancia La Jolla. It's always a pleasure to hear when our team leaves such an impression. We will certainly share your kind words with Evan, Lisa and the rest of the Estancia staff. We look forward to welcoming you back soon.
0	Wedding trip. I will never stay at this hotel again as many things were either hard to turn on or not in working order. No coffee at breakfast as machine was broke, no sign hung on the machine saying that it was out of order. Cool shower every day. Stayed close to office and doors were being slammed all night long.Your business is very important to us and we value your feedback. By telling us what you liked about your stay and how we can improve, you are helping us deliver a superior experience for you and other guests in the future.
0	Cockroaches and brown water.. I arrived at this hotel during a work trip at 1 am. I encountered brown water coming from the sink and several cockroaches in the hallway. I slept there because I had nowhere else to go. In the morning I informed the staff. I received no apology, no refund and no follow-up phone call. Need I say more
1	Good But!. We have stayed at the Estancia several times we always have a good time enjoy the ambiance of the property. This time, weekend before Christmas was exceptionally quiet we took advantage of that because we've been there w/ one or two weddings or a jazz concert on their large main courtyard it gets very busy, crowded noisy!The grounds are very pretty, the large pool area very inviting heated! w/ a decent sized spa adjacent plus facilities. The resort sits on 9 plus acres, so you can manage to find manicured nooks, some w/ fireplaces to enjoy that quiet time. . Adjacent to the resort on a nice walk is the Salk Institute next to that the Gliderport. Something to see if u enjoy watching gliders along the beautiful coastline! Keep in mind this resort is not in the busy w/ tight parking La Jolla downtown area, its more of a relax get away stay put kinda place at least for us:)If you want right on the coast but in downtown La Jolla I would also consider the Pantai Inn.The rooms we have had are the standard w/ King although not very large they are comfortable well decorated. Small fridge available (used to be the locked booze bar). The bathrooms are also spacious w/ tub shower all amenities. There is a security safe for your valuables good coffee tea by a nook in the entryway available. On this outing we had a balcony but it only had room for one seat to enjoy the smaller court yard below.The But comes with our experience w/ Mustangs Burros their restaurant/bar w/ a beautiful large stone/brick fireplace seating area. Since TripAdvisor doesn't want reviewers to talk about restaurants on the Hotel review portion I will cover that on my separate review.Suffice it to say one gripe that ties in to the Resort policy is that we called to make reservations asked if we can bring our wine bottle provided by the resort (included in your resort fee).The answer was of course, yet when we got there the first thing the hostess said was you cant drink your bottle here! It went south from there:(The staff did a good job to be polite attentive I expected that on a very slow weekend.Be aware that there is a separate Valet only parking fee besides the Resort fee, but expectthat all along the CA coast resorts. In light of our issue w/ the MB restaurant/bar I would recommend visiting the Estancia, and I hope they review/revise their policy on that!Its such a pleasure to read such a positive review from a recurring quest! We are so happy that you enjoyed the resorts ambience, pool area, and most importantly the service. We are so appreciative that we have the opportunity to apologize for the miscommunication at Mustangs Burros and will be certain to look into the matter to prevent a mix-up such as this from happening in the future. Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us. We hope we are able to welcome you back again soon!
1	Up To Its Expected Standards. Short but very good stay! Very quick, pleasant and efficient check-in! Makes you wonder why some hotels still choose to go with the 10 minute check in scenario. Room was spotless with all necessary amenities. Staff also very polite both at Reception and Housekeeping. I was a bit annoyed that my card was charged without asking me as I wanted to pay cash upon departure. Perhaps in future it will be nice to give your guests the choice.Overall though a good stay! Hello DinosEdinburgh, It's a pleasure to hear your feedback about your check in experience. I'm sorry to hear about the advance charge, I believe this was only an authorization because we don't charge anything until check out. Our guests are always welcome to change their form of payment to cash upon departure. Thank you for choosing to stay with us and I hope we can welcome you back soon. Be well, Alyssa Turowski, General Manager
0	Really Gone Downhill. I stayed here a few years back, and it was pretty nice. Not fancy, but overall very good. Wow, what a difference a couple of years makes. Must have new management or something. First off, the cable was out (all but 1 channel). Not a huge deal for me, but was told other rooms had cable, so I switched. The... More
1	Pooch approved. Amazing stay at the Kimpton properties. Staff was extremely pleasant as soon as we checked in. Provided a cute puppy welcome bag with treats and pet friendly locations. Also pet bed ans bowls are available upon request. Celebrated bday outing and dropped off mini cupcakes and a hand written card. Complimentary cocktail social was great. Would highly recommend to those traveling with pets (no fees) and in an amazing location! Rooms were comfy and plush Happy to hear you enjoyed your stay and were able to take advantage of our excellent downtown location and complimentary pet amenities! Thanks again for choosing our hotel and we look forward to welcoming you and your pooch back in the future! Amber Bertsch Guest Experience Manager
0	worst stay...left early. The freezing pool. The broken jacuzzi. The unfriendly staff. The rattley old refrigerator in the room. The only cheapest harsh bright white lights used, no night lights. We could hear everyone above and beside us, so the construction of this place is very poor.
0	Worst. Dirty room,uncomfortable beds, tv remote didnt work, no parking space
1	Amazing hotel experience in a prime location. The Saint Hotel is a top notch hotel located only half a block from the action of Duval St. From the check-in experience, to the amazing upgraded room overlooking the beautiful infinite pool and the convenience of the prime location in Key West this place was awesome. Upon check-in I was helped to my room by the amazingly helpful and friendly staff and I was directed to some places I should check out for the nightlife all within walking distance. The next 2 days, I started my mornings with the complimentary continental breakfast followed by exploring the island of Key West on 1 of the complimentary hotel bikes. I was able to end my afternoons with some relaxation in the amazing pool area. The entire staff was extremely helpful and professional throughout my stay. It was great to see the manager Abraham was very active with the everyday workings of the hotel staff and guests to ensure everyone has a great, unforgettable experience at the Saint. I would without a doubt stay at The Saint on my next trip to Key West!!Miss Elissa, Very Nice, you told me you were going to write a review, but I didn't expect all this, your writing has definitely spread smiles throughout the employees. Thank You, the whole staff thanks you.

0	Worst management I've seen. I had a room reserved for me by the National Guard for july 15th and 16th. About 5:30 is when i showed up to the hotel on the evening of the 15th. I told the lady at the front desk that i had this reservation for tonight and that the national guard was the ones who had set it up... More
1	Customer service excellent and hotel very nice. Stayed here one night - got a great rate on Expedia (around 50). Checked in before 1:00 because we were going to a Dallas Stars game at 2:00 and they were able to accomodate us. First room they gave us on the third floor reeked of smoke (despite not being a smoking room), so we called to inquire abotu switching rooms and without asking they upgraded us to a deluxe room which had a larger bed and a couch, which was very nice. The room was immaculate and very comfortable. One thing they might do to improve would be flat screen LCD televisions but other than that we had a great stay. They have a great business center, always have hot coffee in the lobby (its good too), and the staff is friendly. Location is also excellent for the AA Center, and many other downtown attractions. Would stay again.Dear Valued Guest:I want to thank you for your response and selecting our hotel for your visit. If there is ever anything we can be of service, please let us know at anytime. We look forward to seeing you in the future and thank you again.General Manager - Blake Doran
0	2 room changes and poor service. Our first room we were placed in had a sink that didn't drain. We were moved within a few minutes to the second room next door and were told a bottle of wine would be sent up as an apology. The second room not only had a sink that didn't work, it was full of filthy black water. Gross!!! We were moved to a third room with a sink that didn't work very well, but we were so tired of moving we decided to deal with it. We came back from dinner and found no wine and it was brought up only after we had called. The final straw was the lack of room cleaning. The maid service didn't stop by despite our calls for 2 days and would only pick up towels and most days cleaning service didn't show up until 4-5 in the afternoon. Trying to bill this Best Western as upscale is a joke. The service was unacceptable and they deseperately need to work on their house keeping and sink issues.
1	Over the holidays. I just wanted to say that my family and I stayed there about a week ago and we were so impressed with the customer service skills from Staci, she did everything from making sure we had extra towels and face cloths in the room because thats what we noted in our reservation, checking us in early, she called us once we got in the room and settled to make sure the room was okay. She printed out directions every time we needed them and she was just a joy to talk with. She is really good at her position. The hotel overall was excellent and we will definitely return.On behalf of our front office staff we want to thank you for staying at our location. Stacey is one of our best employees. Our Count on Me Wyndham Culture was built on taking care of the guest needs. We believe at the Wingate that our customers pay our salaries and deserve to be served as guests. Please feel free to stay at our location on your next visit to Atlanta.Willis Blake DOS

1	Another wonderful stay at the Vagabond oasis!. This wasn't our first stay at the Vagabond- we love it! Whenever we're in Miami, it's the perfect landing spot. The service is consistently excellent. The staff makes a conscious effort to find ways for guests to be comfortable, leaving stress behind. The Restaurant there is so good.. farm to table, with great options. Shout out to Jennifer- the most personable waitress! The rooms are decorated and designed to step into a fully updated motel of the past- but better. There were NO motels like this in the 50's! The showers, the lighting.. even the smallest details lend themselves to the laid back environment. They have pool parties near the outdoor, colorfully lit bar each night- frankly they close down at just the right hour and we've never been disturbed. If you're looking for an alternative to 'South Beach crazy', this reasonably priced oasis is a find.Thank you for your return visit and so glad you not only enjoyed the pool bar but also the restaurant. We look forward to your return visit, soon we hope!
0	Cigarette smell. I'll start with the good, very near Sea World and easy drive to Disney. Delicious breakfast, fun pool, and overall kind employees. But one major negative problem was cigarette smell. Our room was almost uninhabitable due to the smoke smell, it hit you in the hallway as you open the door! It was so strong everyone got a headache, so we avoided staying in the room as much as possible. Supposedly non-smoking hotel but this room didn't get the message. We told the staff and reminded them everyday (stayed three nights), and they never were able to move us to another room. And I left my number for the manager and attempted to meet with him multiple times, but he never called or was available. So they made absolutely zero amends for the situation, not even a real apology. Too bad, because this place should be a great stay, but they shouldn't claim to be smoke free and certainly could be more professional in at least calling me back when there is a problem. So I won't be staying there again and would not recommend it after my experience. Good Morning Sir,I would like to start of by apologizing sincerely about smoke smell you had to endure during the duration of your stay. Our goal is to always make sure our guest leave here satisfied, and unfortunately we failed at meeting that promise for you. We are non-smoking hotel for this very reason, I would like to talk to you more about your stay, please, if you could please give me a call here at the hotel 407-239-4540 EXT 134, I would love to talk to you about this. Once again we sincerely apologize and I look forward to hoping in redeeming myself and our brand with you Sir. Thank you Les Harris
0	Buy earplugs. Hotel was functional. Stayed for one night and glad it wasn't any longer. Check in was easy and efficient. Parking is directly behind the hotel. There is a tiny little alley that you wouldn't notice on the left side on the hotel, there are about 10 parking spaces and it's first come first serve. This is a very industrial neighborhood....

1	Business Trip 3/2/2016. Great Stay-I was provided an upgraded suite room. Very nice. Room suite very spacious. All hotel amenities were readily available. Hotel staff was very courteous and helpful. I will definitively stay here again. I like the close proximity to freeway, shopping center and restaurants. Waffle house restaurant breakfast was fantastic and very delicious. Thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey regarding your recent stay at our hotel.Your feedback is very important to us and we can assure you that we will use this information to do everything possible to create an enjoyable experience for each of our guests. We hope to see you again soon!Sincerely,David FuentesFront DeskQuality Suites Mission Valley(619)-881-4000
1	Great place, great location and great service!. I traveled to New Orleans with my husband for a 3 night stay. This was our first trip here and we had a blast! The Drury Inn was the perfect place to stay! The breakfast was perfect, the free drinks/food at happy hour were a plus, and the staff couldn't have been more friendly!. Our room was very clean, bigger than I expected (just a standard room) and the bathroom had a marble look. The in-room fridge microwave was awesome. We utilized the pool every day and it was very quiet and refreshing. The fitness room contained 2 treadmills 1 bike and a flat screen tv. No weights, but at least there was a place to run off some fun from the night before! The location was a few short blocks to anything and everything! We always opted for the main streets, and never felt scared on any of our walks around town (even at 2am). We will stay here again the next time we visit for sure! Make sure to get a hand grenade at Tropical Isle. 3 will get the job done. Enjoy!!!!!
1	GOOD VENUE FOR BUSINESS MEETINGS. Recently had an enjoyable 3 night stay at the Westin. It is definitely a business meeting destination, but is well located in downtown San Diego. I do not recommend it for family vacations. The service from all was very good as were the meals. The rooms have different shapes, but are comfortable. The shower has a rain forest shower head plus a wand on a hose. The lighting in the bathroom is excellent. So if you are on a business trip you will enjoy.Dear Jim F,We are a great choice for business and leisure. Our location makes it easy to get to all of downtown San Diegos attractions. The Midway, Childrens Museum and the World Famous San Diego Zoo are only minutes from the hotel. I am pleased to hear that you enjoyed our Westin Heavenly Bath. Our showerhead, the drench, is there to help renew and relax your senses during your stay. Our signature heavenly mirrors in our newly remodeled bathrooms guarantee you put your best face forward. I look forward to seeing you again the next time you travel to San Diego.Remain Well, Alyssa TurowskiGeneral Manager
1	Great hotel. I booked this hotel after reading reviews on trip advisor and it was a really good choice. The hotel is clean, comfortable and very well kept. It's got a very modern, urban decor which may not be to everyone's taste but I loved it! My room was pretty huge and the bathroom was great with everything I needed. There was an in room safe, air conditioner and hair dryer so all the usual amenities. All the staff I met were very friendly and helpful. The hotel is just out of the centre, about five minutes walk from Bourbon street and the French Quarter so very handy for the bars and restaurants, there are also a couple of supermarkets nearby. The hotel bar is very nice too.
0	Terrible terrible hotel experience. I'm not usually a review poster but our stay at America's Best Value Inn in Grand Junction CO was so horrendously awful that it deserves some public attention. Our AC in our room was not working so we notified the front desk and someone was sent to evaluate it. No maintenance was done to improve the AC but the attendant... More
0	All the negative reviews are true...and much worse!!!. I am writing the review at the hotel. Lets just put aside the inconvenience of the location aside at the moment. I chose to stay here inside of the south beach because I want a quiet hotel but guess what, there are plane flying over my head every ten minutes! And guess what, when I called the front desk they told me they have never heard any plane noise. I went down to talk to the manager on duty and he claimed he has never had any complaints and he has been working here for two years. They are treating me as if I made this up. I invited the manager on duty to go to my room to prove that there are planes noise every ten minutes. He heard it himself very inevitably and instead of trying to solve the problem, simply told me that there is nothing he can do about the planes. I told him that I am aware of it but is the other side of the hotel going to be better I asked. Of course he can't answer the questions since he claimed no guests have complained about the noise before...well they must all be deaf. I requested to check the rooms on the other side of the hotel. We went together and it's slightly better, the catch is its facing a main road and there is traffic. I truly dislike how they handle my complaints. Now lets get to some other technical issue. The vents of the air conditioning blows directly to the bed onto my head so I can't turn any air conditioning on. By the way they don't give you adapters, they are part of the minibar item so you need to purchase them. Not to mention that one needs to purchase wifi connection. That is the least of the problems. By the way I asked the manager on duty in light of the noise of planes on the one side and the traffic on the other side of the hotel, which is the lesser of two evils for an insomniac like me. He said it would be the side facing traffic. Oh so he finally heard the plane noise So I didn't make it up after all! Shame on this mandarin oriental. The chain should disown this property to preserve its standard. Do not stay here!Dear Ms. Yao,I am very sorry to read of the noise disturbance you encountered which has also been brought to my attention by our Front Office Manager and our Rooms Division Director, who has tried contacting you.Please understand that Mandarin Oriental, Miami was built with the highest of standards and to withstand category five hurricane force winds.We are an urban city resort, tucked away on a semi private island, away from the traffic noise of downtown and the South Beach festive scene. We have never received a report from our guests of air traffic noise since the hotel opened and if you review other Trip Advisor reports, there has not been such an incident.I would like to assist in making the remainder of your stay seamless and enjoyable and would like to speak with you. Please contact me at your earliest convenience to see what we can do to help make your stay a restful one.Kind regards,Greg NunezHotel Manager
0	Mold in rooms. Mold in the first three rooms they showed me. Not until they sent me to the top floor in the fourth room did I find a room that didn't smell of mold. Good service willing to help, and very attentive, but they need to fix the mold in their rooms.
1	Excellent Hotel, great service. This is not your typical Drury inn! This is no cookie cutter hotel. We were very surprised at the lovely lobby and rooms at this hotel. We loved the staff who were very helpful on our first trip to New Orleans and the rooms have high ceilings with impressive tall windows.The beds were very comfortable and any troubles we had were addressed immediately. The hotel is within walking distance of the French Quarter if you want a small hike, but we did drive and park. There are closer hotels.They offer 3 complimentary drinks per night for guests and the free breakfast is very good.All this at a very attractive rate. We got there same day and were able to get a discounted rate.Overall, I would stay here again and again!
0	Aging, Needs Some TLC. I picked this location because it was close to MCO, relatively affordable, and had a free airport shuttle. The room was ok, though is showing wear (for example, bathroom tiles were cracked and some grout was missing). The linens were very cheap and coarse (I quite literally got rug burn on my elbow from rolling over in the night). The shuttle to the airport in the morning was fine, but I couldn't get the front desk to stay on the line long enough to get picked up from the airport after returning my rental car (seriously irritating when someone answers the phone and immediately puts you on hold before taking 30 seconds or less to understand the reason for the call). I spent about 10 minutes on hold (despite trying to call 3 different times) and eventually took a cab to the hotel (which annoyed the cabbie greatly since it was a short fare).Given this experience, I wouldn't recommend staying here unless it's the cheapest cost. It was reasonably quiet and I slept ok all things considered, but there are several options in the immediate vicinity.Dear Falconsview, thank you for sharing your experience and for being our guest. While overall you had a pleasant stay, we are unhappy with the lack of service received from our front desk staff. Please accept our apologies for any inconveniences that you experienced being put on hold for so long. We have discussed your comments with our staff to make sure each guest is greeted promptly and no requests are ignore. We would really appreciate you giving us another opportunity to prove ourselves the next time you are in the area. We hope to see you again soon.Sincerely,Michael GoldwasserGeneral Manager
1	Nice Hotel Near Airport and Very Pleasant. Went for a weekend seminar for my career and it was lovely. Decorations look very modern with dark furniture and orange/bronze colors. Lovely Conference and Ball Rooms. Food was terrific and served coffee, tea and water in glasses instead of paper cups. Quiet room, fairly large, ice on hallway and I had a card to get to the top floor so I felt a little safer since I was traveling alone. Price was reasonable, checkout under the door (nice so you don't have to wait in a long line) and they held all the bags with security in a special room until the shuttle took us to the airport. I was a late traveler going home and had free internet all day while working in hallway and conference. Lovely newer shuttle bus took me to the airport at 5:45 pm. Shuttle runs 6am-11pm. Then late travelers can call between 11pm-6am and they will drive there to pick you up. Grounds and pool seemed nice and restaurant and bar always packed with happy people. Great view of the city and hotel is on final approach of airport. It was rather exciting to watch the planes going over the hotel especially at dusk. Highly recommend this hotel. Also convenient to take the shuttle across the freeway to the train and go downtown.Dear Kristin H.:Thank you for taking the time to write about your stay with us. We greatly appreciate all guest comments and are certainly happy to learn that you enjoyed your stay. Wishing you safe travels. Dieter Heigl
0	Not a nice place to stay for the money. The hotel was noisey during the night with people coming and going knocking on doors and people walking around all night long. I could not reccommend staying there. The internet was not working and there was no attempt to get it fixed. Some tall black guy walking around minding everyones business.
1	Big Room. Arrived late Friday night. The front desk was very accommodating once we arrived. We were there to run a half marathon on Sunday and the start line was right out our front door. A few blocks off of Bourbon Street which was really nice to do but walkable, uber, streetcar. Just however you chose to get around. Room was spacious and clean, the staff cleaning was very nice. We didn't get our room cleaned on Saturday but were given fresh towels and wash clothes. Requested a late check out which was granted while we piddle around town bc our flight was at 6:30. I would recommend staying especially at the price.Hello Guest,Thank you for taking the time to leave us with feedback after your departure. I would like to thank you for such a wonderful review on behalf of the entire staff. We work hard to make sure our guests are happy and are always humbled to know when this shines through! Thank you so much for choosing to stay with us and we hope you will stay with us again soon!Teresa Munoz - Revenue Manager
1	Amazing hotel. Amazing hotel, great service . They make you feel like you are their main concern . The rooms are amazing very clean, and equipped with every thing. It's my forth time here and I'm sure I will be back here again. The hotel experience is part of what makes the trip :)Dear adeeyacoby, It was truly a pleasure having you as our guest during your recent visit to New York City.On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we are so pleased that you were able to experience our hotel again and enjoy the high service and quality levels which we pride ourselves on.Thank you for your time in reviewing our property on TripAdvisor, and please let us know when you will be returning, as we would love to have you back soon.Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager
0	Never again. I was very disappointed in this hotel. It was not what I expected since it was to be renovated. It took me about 20 minutes to find the entrance. I arrived late at time and a sign with a red background and red lettering was not a good thing. When you add in poor lighting, it definitely was not a good mix. When I checked in there were a few peopled in the lobby and outside. this raised safety concerns. I obtain my keys and receive directions to my room. Again, more people hanging outside. I enter the room and realized the mistake I made. The room was very small with no iron, ironing board or coffeemaker (most hotels provide these basic items). I read the booklet and I learned to enjoy these benefits, I would have to upgrade which I began to think it wouldn't be worth it. The next morning I left the room and there was woman sitting outside in a lawn chair. I returned 3 hours later and she was still there. If it couldn't get worse, when I returned later that night, two men were sitting outside a room, in lounge chairs, music playing and a small grill on the grass. At this point I was relieved that I was leaving in the morning and this would be a distant memory very quickly.
1	Oh my word - healthy room service!!!. I stayed at the Inn at Virginia Mason for a coffee conference in May and must say I was very pleasantly surprised by the excellent quality of room service food - many healthy choices and the menu had detailed nutritional advice. Hotel dcor is quaint and has a vintage feel - this is definitely an Inn! They could get rid of the heavy curtains, but they are efficient at keeping out noise and drafts. The facility primarily services medical patients and families and is on a steep hill. Good for walking off the wine!Hi Traveler - Thank you for your review. Yes, room service is healthy and a great value (just like our guest rooms). Please come see us again when you are in Seattle. Until then, safe travels!
0	Disgusting. This hotel is absolute garbage. From the quality of the rooms to the entire staff,absolutely nothing held up to standards you would expect from a 4 star hotel. Good luck if you want to actually make it to the airport on time, their shuttle service was a complete joke.
0	Not bad, but expect some noise around the corner. It's a large and clean room so quite comfortable to stay over night. But there was a thing that bothered me too much NOISE. You can hear from the train (near by, running late and early), and the door next room keeps bothering us with door shutting hard. We would be more appreciated if we're arranged different room and corner.... More
1	What can I say...... This is by far the best hotel in the USA we ever stayed in. Who cares the view on some backyard from the window. Not one sound from the busy Bush Street can be heard. The rooms on front should be sound proof according the hotel staff. The breakfast is basic and rather expensive. Cold hard boiled eggs, bread, coffee or tea and juices from the bottle and of course some cereals. For additionals high priced extras can be ordered. We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. The dinner food is great, but the choice very limited, so we had to go to the French restaurant Restaurant de la Presse on the opposite of the entrance in Bush Street. One remark about the sound proof quality of our room. At one moment it looked like our neighbours were really inside our room. They had a normal conversation and we could understand every word of it!!! So we were just lucky with quiet neighbours who did not shout or laughed loud or put on the TV set maximum! You better go for a room without connecting doors.The hotel is extremely green and was awarded for this, too. Free WiFi, which works fast all the time.A special compliment to the porters, who proved to be very helpful with good tips.
1	Quick retreat to Baltimore. Last second decision to visit Baltimore. We were greeted by Marq, a pleasant young man, who upgraded us to a king suite. She even provided us discounted tickets to the aquarium when we checked out the following day. The room was very spacious, clean and quiet. (Our room was close to the elevators but we didn't eben noticed it). The location of the hotel is central to the inner harbor offerings and to Little/Italy and Fells landing. There are many upscale stores nearby to browse as well as many fine restaurants. The gym was fine to work a quick sweat. Breakfast included was decent but nothing to rave about. Overall, the staff was very courteous and the hotel had a modern edge look which suited us just fine. Marq was the superstar during our stay. HIgh recommendation.
1	Great suite next to Angels stadium w/ 3 separate beds. Nice suite with 2 bedrooms fold out couch- was great to have 3 separate places to sleep, for 3 guys in town for LA Angels vs Red Sox baseball game.. Great ideal location for ballpark access- w/ parking included easy walk to ball field. Great breakfast. Best value for suite of any hotel i stayed in over my week in California. All rooms in suite were clean nice. (Would also be good for family going to nearby disneyland)We are delighted to have been your chosen hotel during your recent stay in Anaheim. It wastruly a pleasure to serve you.We appreciate your business and value your honest feedback.

0	Not for business travel. Rude customer service at check in even for a Hilton Diamond Member,noisy, only 1 elevator working. Large group of over 100 plus in the hotel breakfast area making it impossible to even grab a cup of coffee. Worst hotel in 11 years of business travel. Thank you for sharing your comments regarding your recent stay here at the Hampton Inn Atlanta Perimeter Center. Thank you for being a Diamond Member. Please except my apologies on behalf of our entire staff that our hotel while normally is quiet and busy, the hotel was noisy during this groups stay. We did have 5 bus tours of guests who were attending the International Rotary Convention. Sorry for the inconvenience that you were not able to get in to get your coffee during the peak time from in which most of the group had previously arrived. Once again my apologies , I hope that you will give us another opportunity to win you back. We do appreciate your business and we want you back with us.
0	Great Walking Distance to Old Town but a Terrible Hotel. The Hotel has terrible WiFi that randomly disconnects every few seconds. The parking is bad and there are only like 2 elevators. This hotel is not meant for disabled people or elderly, even those who have trouble walking up stairs or have bad knees. I had to carry all my suitcases up three flight of stairs just to get to my room. I even had to help two elderly people carry their suit cases up the stairs. The layout of the hotel map is confusing as it is. If anything the Hotel needs to add more elevators for each building and not only for two buildings. The only reason I booked this hotel was due to the lack of hotels during Comic Con. I won't be going to this hotel again.I am so sorry to hear you experienced inconveniences while getting around the property. This is not the kind of experience we want our guests to have. Our team can usually assist folks with luggage and getting to the room, as most hours we do have a bellman. Also, seven of our eight buildings have elevators. Again, my apologies we did not better anticipate your needs. If there is anything further you would like to add to your comments that would assist us in improving the experience, please feel free to reach out to me through the hotel.
0	Poor reservation help!. Rooms were fine, breakfast was fair and reservation were a disaster. Poorly trained reservationist, said room would cost one thing and said he'd call me back after specking with management for rate. He didn't. I called back the next day he quoted me higher rate...said rate had been approved. After fighting for it, an adjustment was made.
1	Awesome hotel location.. We stayed the weekend at the River Hotel and could not have been happier. The staff at the front desk was amazing. They provided us with coupons for a free appetizer or dessert at Lou Malnatis. They also provided some great recommendations for breakfast. The room was great. It was a little small but all Chicago rooms are small. It was clean and had a great view of the river and the Trump building across the river. The bed was comfortable. The location was close to all the downtown attractions with a big bus double decker bu stop right across the street.
1	Great location and close to attractions.. I recently visited the area for Spring Break. This location was perfect. Close to all of the major attractions (Petco Park, Sea World, SD Zoo, etc). We were very close to the interstate but the location was very quiet. Shopping centers, movie theater, and numerous restaraunts nearby. We had issues checking in and the room type we booked was not available the first night. We were put in a smaller room but we did get a discounted rate for the inconvenience. Breakfast included hot items but they left a bit to be desired but my kids loved the make your own waffles (get there early or prepare to stand in line for quite a while). The outdoor heated pool/hot tub area was nice and well stocked with towels. The rooms were a bit tight (family suites) but they were very clean and the beds were comfortable. There are lots of families that stay here so there was constant noise from children running the corridors so if you are looking for peace and quiet this might not be for you. Overall a nice stay despite a few issues.We are glad that you liked the location of the hotel which is very close to all the attractions, walking distance shopping mall and restaurants. Thank you very much for appreciating heated pool. We very much appreciate and value your feedback and will share it with our team. It is always a pleasure to receive positive feedback.See you when you will visit Sunny San Diego again!!!Sincerely,Sarika DesaiAssistant General ManagerComfort Suites Mission Valley SeaWorld Area619-881-4000
1	wonderful new hotel. Even though I'm a local I stayed here with a group before a cruise. Right across from the space needle and they offer a shuttle for the downtown area. Because its across from the Monorail station it makes getting downtown super easy. New rooms with electric shades, refrigerators and microwaves. While rooms are slightly smaller the furnishings are top notch. The breakfast buffet is great with an omelette bar and lots of fresh fruits. Lobby bar and restaraunt is very reasonable and good. I'd be happy to recommend this hotel to friends and travelers as its super nice.davidgmg,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your staycation here in Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor. We are thrilled to hear that you created wonderful memories and utilized the amenities within our beautiful new hotel. We are always trying to leave our guests with lasting memorable experiences. Please let us know when you want another getaway as we would love to you welcome you as our guest again!Sarah Junge
0	Needs updated. First room had an odor so they diid move us to another room. Clerk very accommodating. Hotel needs upgraded doesn't give the impression it is kept up as it should be.
1	No Regrets!. For a 3Star Hotel, we could not have been any happier with our selection! The hotel staff were super nice and efficient, especially Jeana at the front desk and Tatum in house keeping. The lobby is great with a very nice and plentiful breakfast, as well as snacks midday and coffee or lemon infused water all day! Our room was super clean and could not have been nicer, plus having two separate vanities/sinks really spoiled us. There was even a window in the bathroom for FRESH air. We found the French Quarters to be dirty and intimidating at times (so many homeless), so being in this area was another plus...surrounded by beautiful homes, trolley across the street, a few blocks from the Fresh Market grocery and the best bonus of all was the grassy park right next door which came in handy for those late night/early morning potty breaks for our dog. I am so glad that we were unable to find a pet friendly hotel WITH GRASS in the Quarters as we would have been so unhappy and absolutely loved our stay here, and this location for half the price also!! One more thing is parking...it was free and gated They gave us a remote control so we could come and go as we pleased knowing we would always have a free parking space waiting for us at the end of the day. Never saw a manager, but did not need to. Everything ran smooth and efficient. Good job!!
1	Good location, Very good service. We stayed here in March, 2014. They are having construction going on but it did not cause us any problem. We had a rental car and used the valet service. It was efficient and courteous. Check-in was easy.Security is good. You have to use your room key to use the elevator. The room was clean and had a mini-refrigerator and flat screen television that also had digital channel selections. The bed was very comfortable. The curtains kept the light out when closed.They have an evening buffet, which was very good. You also get up to three individual selections of beer or mixed drinks. Breakfast was very good also and has wide selection. They also have popcorn and soft drink area that is open until around 10 pm daily.The hotel is about three blocks from the French Quarter which is easy to walk and convenient. Getting in and out from the hotel by car is easy, much easier than from within the French Quarter.We had no problems here. The staff was friendly and helpful. I would recommend this hotel.
0	The room had a odor.. the staff was very friendly, but the room smelled musty and the carpet felt dirty.
0	Cockroaches. Nice location and convenient to the beach. The property is pretty old and outdated. The room had to many cockroaches. Cockroaches were on the desk and in the furniture. Would be nice if the rooms were pest free.
1	best deal for the price. I wanted to stay overnight for the Air Show there were 600,000 people in AC, so I knew we would have to pay top dollar to stay anywhere. All the Casinos were booked and all the board walk properties were also booked with the exception of the 2 star Days Inn which wanted 280 per night. I decided to go for the best western 129 even though I had read some questionable reviews. We were suprised at how nice the hotel looked. It was clean nice tiled bathroom new looking carpet on hall floors and in the room. The AC in our room worked fine and was on when we got there. There was a nice sized frige, coffee machine and blow dryer. The halls were warm because windows were open (no AC on). We had a great complimentary breakfast in the morning including fresh make your own belgium waffels, bagles, pastries, muffins juices and coffee. Staff was friendly and helpful. Being a city girl I was definately on my guard walking the one long block from the boardwalk at night 1AM but it was well lit and had several clubs and resturants along the way. It is also centrally located to all the Casinos and the beach has a boardwalk entryway with a rinse off shower and public bathrooms.
0	sleep on the street is better. I would sleeep on the street rather than this Motel.
0	Disappointed. False advertisement. No breakfast and no iron like quoted in description
0	One nighter. Room clean but......tv remote didn't work Tub stopper didn't work Security latch on door not secure, loose screws Sitting chair arm comes loose Door handle lock loose and comes open REAL easy, with the. slightest bump to handle, even though bolted!!! Quality control lacking at Quality Inn.
1	Close to Seattle Center. We ended up staying here last minute when other plans fell through and we were very pleased. It's within walking distance to Seattle Center which makes it great if you're going to the Pacific Science Center which was the reason for our visit. The room was great and the staff was very helpful. It's kind of tucked away in a semi-industrial looking area which concerned me a little bit at first because we had our young children with us but after walking around the neighborhood at night I realized it wasn't a problem. There is a QFC (grocery store) just around the corner which was great for grabbing snacks for the room and a quick bite before we hit Seattle Center. You can walk to Pike Market from here but it's about 1.5 miles away. We just walked there during the day and took a cab back to the hotel at night. All in all I enjoyed the stay there and would recommend it if you want to be in the Seattle Center area.
0	Absolutely Disturbing. I was please to see how close the hotel was to Kings Dominion (across the street) and a Denny's right next door. The good points ended there, however. Upon entering the room, we noticed lots of white hairs on the floor, so we requested that the floor be vacuumed. I requested a rollaway and we started to set it up after we came back from the amusement park. When I opened it, I found a blood stain on the mattress cover. The front desk was alarmed by the finding, but suggested we cover it with sheets (really). I had them take it away, so my little cousin ended up sleeping in the chair. Much later that night, the toilet was stopped up, but maintenance was to busy to fix it, so a plunger was delivered for us to do it. The toilet kept running the entire night. The following morning the toilet overflowed, so we weren't able to shower and we checked out. Each incident was reported to the front desk and we received a 20 discount, which was unsatisfactory given all of the issues encountered. Hotels.com helped to resolve the issue. Thank you Hotels.com! I would never stay at this location again. I would rather drive a few more miles to get the amusement park, than have the convenience of being close yet sacrifice great service.
1	Close to Pentagon and Metro but pricey. The Embassy Suites Crystal City is a nice hotel, the closest one to the Pentagon. They will drive you to the Pentagon in their shuttle but you have to walk across the whole parking lot to get to the entrance. If it is raining or snowing that might be a uncomfortable walk. The walk to the Metro is the longest in Crystal City but still not too bad, about 5 blocks. Their shuttle is great, they will drop you off to restaurants or the metro, but you might have to wait a bit to get a ride. My only issue are they do not have enough smoking rooms - they always say they are full and they have plenty of rooms and floors to add smoking rooms and it is pricy - but that is to be expected in DC.
1	Not so family-oriented. We had a long layover in San Francisco and chose to stay in Union Square. The St Regis met our needs in terms of a comfortable place to stay, from which to explore some of the touristy areas of SF. However, traffic getting into the hotel was a nightmare, partly due to Pride weekend when we were there, but in general it did take a long time to battle our way to the entrance every time we took the car out. Service was great at check-in, but when we asked for a kettle for the room and tea, it took about half an hour to arrive, with no tea bags. We don't generally enjoy the butler concept- when we asked for coffee, which was not available in the room like in other hotels, the butler charged us USD18. There was limited food options- a lobby restaurant/ bar and a second restaurant in the back. Food was extremely pricey. The pool was not something my kids wanted to use- a simple lap pool for adults. We are asked for the kids names and told the housekeeping would deliver something for them, but it didn't materialize, much to their disappointment. It is definitely geared toward the business traveler.Dear Globaltattler,Thank you so much for taking the time to share your most recent experience at the St. Regis San Francisco. We apologize that you experienced increased traffic over the Pride weekend, and that our Butler service did not meet your expectations. Here at the St. Regis San Francisco we truly strive to surprise and delight all of our guests, and we are always grateful for any feedback that will allow us to do that better.Please do reach out to me personally should your travels bring you back to San Francisco.Warm Regards,Andre BroseHotel Manager
0	Never again.. We were staying for one night for the BOA Marching band competition. I reviewed all the pictures online and read the reviews. You will always have mixed reviews. Based on the information I decided to book the night. The hotel lobby's door was broken. The front staff upon checking in were not personable. They provided us the room and upon entering that part of the hotel, it was not too clean and this had me worried. I had read about a newly renovated part of the hotel and prayed we would have it. No such luck. The room smelled, there was a dirty toothbrush in the corner of the room. There was also a burn mark on the carpet from an iron. I was so embarrased for my family that I actually booked this. We stayed anyway because I did not want to lose my money. Upon waking up my back hurt so bad I couldn't breathe. I could not wait to go home.
0	A Very Noisy Nights Rest!. As traveling thru Perry Georgia, we stayed overnight at Motel 6. Their was blood on the bathroom door. The bed was very uncomfortable, very old and worn out. The place was noisy all night long. Doors slamming, people yelling Wfi did not work.i Do not recommend.
0	bad customer service. This was worst hotel. Te service no good. They need training customer service.
0	Bad Condition. Old rooms that smell like an ash tray everything looks old
1	Wizard World visit. Excellent customer service and very easy check in process. The rooms are spacious and beds are comfortable. The location is great for not only the convention center, but is a quick subway trip or walking distance to most of Philadelphia most famous attractions. And having the Reading Terminal Market directly across the street is a great added bonus. There are several very good dining choices very close by. The added security of having to use your room key to enter the hotel and use the elevator is a great feature. Overall, this was a great hotel stay and recommend using Home2 Suites. We will definitely look forward to staying here again .Dear saturn445,I would like to thank you for choosing the Home2 Suites by Hilton Philadelphia for your recent stay. I appreciate all of your great comments and I am glad you enjoyed your stay with us! With so many choices here in center city Philadelphia, we greatly appreciate your business and look forward to welcoming you back soon, until then...With Hospitality,Jason Bloom General ManagerHome2 Suites by HiltonYour Second Home Away From Home
1	Great location for disney or business. If you are going to either Disneyland or coming for business this hotel is situated in an excellent way. Just a 15 min. walk from Disneyland and a 10 min. walk from the Anaheim convention center, thou it is a bit pricey but it is to be expected in an area like this. The rooms are very good and clean and check-in is very fast. Being a European i just don't like the fact that this hotel (like many other in the US) don't have breakfast but a breakfast to go good thing is that there is a dennys 20m away where you can have a decent breakfast, and they even have a small pool and jacuzzi if you want to relax after a days walk in Disneyland. Overall a very recommendable location.Thank you for your recent stay with us at the Best Western Plus Pavilions. We are happy to hear you found our hotel and location helpful to your travels. As you stayed we are just a short walk to the Anaheim Convention Center as well as Disneyland. We hope to see you on future trips to the Anaheim area. Thank you again.
0	Worst service ever!!!. I was unfortunate enough to stay here for 2 days and it was the worst hotel/motel I've ever stayed at....the room was very dirty a lot of things were broken bathroom/shower was terrible but worst was the Indian lady running the place.... she was the most rude and disrespectful person I've ever met a straight b.... check out was 1030... More
1	Great Place to Stay. All round wonderful experience. From the time we got there to the time we left the staff and service was outstanding. Ryan the Guest services person who checked us in set the tone for the rest of the stay. He was extremely courteous and helpful with all our requests, offered us advice on transportation and dining in the area which was great. We ate at the Quarter Deck restaurant he recommended all three days we were there for lunch it was so good. Cant say enough good things about the Virginian Suites!!! If your looking for a nice clean place close to everything at about half the price of the hotels downtown, you have to stay at the Virginian Suites. Cant wait to go back.
0	25.00 hotel room for 100.00. Took almost twenty minutes to check in says it's a ramada has different brand everywhere carpet in hallway looks like a murder scene. Not happy at all. By the way I will take pic of bathtub check it out. 99.00 rooms. Tried to use the phone from the early 20's but no dial tone.
1	Can't beat it for the price. Nice and clean. Decent sized TV that you can rent movies, N64 games, go online, or listen to music. Not much closet space, only get one dresser, but plenty of hanging room. Nice bathroom. Bed was comfortable, but pillows were a little stiff. Kitchen was large enough. Full sized refrigerator with freezer. They have some pots and a pan, and a broiler pan, but no cookie sheets. Plenty of utensils and glasses, and a few things like serving spoons. There's a dish washer, and they give you the detergent. Good microwave, and cabinet space. The oven wasn't the best, but good enough. Take advantage of kitchen, stuff down here is expensive. Friendly staff that was multi-lingual, but spoke English very well. I think their website said olympic sized swimming pool, but the pool was not Olympic sized. There was a lifeguard on duty, but he did not double as a pool boy so there was a good bit of leaves and stuff floating around. Overall I was very happy with the hotel and would definitely stay here again.
0	Worst motel ever. This place was disgusting. The room smelled like molded carpet. The handle on the entry door was broken. The door jam on the entry door looked like it had bee recently kicked in. I'm not sure why this motel would be part of anything associated with Windom hotels. I would like a refund. The worst part is that it cost... More
0	Under Massive Renovation!. I am sure at some point this was a grand hotel but those days are long gone. They are doing a massive renovation inside and out but how they are doing it makes for a terrible room experience. They are going to expand the rooms by 3 feet out to the outer ledge of the outside of the building out... More
0	Used to be great and now not so much. Bummer. We usually stay here every trip to Ojai, because of the Hippy Cali vibe, but this last trip was a disaster. We drove up Sunday night to celebrate my birthday on Monday and we advised the hotel we would be checking in later around 10PM. The front desk staffer called us at 9:21PM to see when we would arrive.

We arrived at 5pm as check in isn't until 4pm to be advised that Management had agreed to late check out on the ocean facing room we had booked and it wouldn't be available until after 7.30 pm (sunset was at 7pm). We were forced into accepting a side view room. Our plans of enjoying our ocean facing room sipping... More
0	Poor Experience on Multiple Levels. We decided on this hotel based on its consistently positive reviews, however this was not our particular experience. Expecting a charming if not quirky older hotel in the French Quarter, we instead encountered unfriendly staff, a poorly situated and crammed room (tons of foot traffic and loud thuds coming from the building door outside our window) a sticky carpet, and most notably, an AC that blew directly onto the bed at night, resulting in a chest cold for the duration of the stay. I wish there were nicer things to say about this Inn, given its location and historic clout, but the room and the level of service of the staff we experienced were not great. Adding insult to injury, the parking arrangement (28 a day) involved putting our car in an open air lot that didn't seem particularly worth the money...we also discovered a scratch on the bumper when the car was brought to us upon hotel departure. I understand that Trip Advisor reviews have been quite positive about the French Market Inn, but had we known our stay would have been so contrary to its online reputation, we would never have stayed. Something to consider if you're looking for a pleasant hotel experience during your visit to Nola.
0	This hotel was our worst hotel experience ever.. We arrived in town at 10am, and asked if we could check in early. We realized we were very early, but hoped we could check in before 3pm. We were told we could not check in early, even though the place was almost a ghost town (there were 3 cars in the parking lot (including ours), and I wondered if the other two belonged to the workers. When we came back at 4:30pm to check in, we were told we would need to get a second room as we had 2 teenagers (plus mom dad) and 3 toddlers. We asked if our toddlers could sleep in a pack n play or on the floor. They said no, so we asked for a refund, so we could make arrangements to stay somewhere that would be more accommodating. They refused to give us a refund, and called the cops. The cops arrived a few minutes later. After hearing both sides, the cops asked the hotel to give us a refund, but the hotel refused. After an hour and fifteen minutes, we agreed to stay there for that night and find another hotel for the next night, but still no refund was provided. To top it off, the hotel was terribly dirty and run down. The pool area needs to be painted as you can see the concrete all over. The room was dirty. This was our worst hotel experience ever.
1	have always adored the pearl !. long overdue, after a recent visit to the pearl for their famous movie nite (the royal tennenbaums !), i feel compelled to share my many great experiences there. my girl and i have dined, swam, stay-cationed, happy-houred, laughed and loved at this wonderful san diego spot.chef jaison rocks delicous meals (pork chop is a must have), queen emily behind the bar slings fantastic cocktails, all the servers are sweet and attentive...seems like one big happy family of pros that work there. adrienne captains the team and her care shines through in all they do.on the hotel side, all the rooms have always been creatively furnished (beta fish!) and spotlessly clean. nice strong coffee in the morning at the bar, swim in the warmed saltwater pool, and you are good to go for the day. try to book the adorably tiny room named the gem- your love life will thank you!On behalf of the entire Pearl crew/family. THANK YOU VERY MUCH for your review and continued support. Hope to see you again soon. Tell a friend.
0	Avoid Like The Plague. Horrible motel, rooms smell of damp, people wandering in off the street to do their laundry or use the pool. Security practically non-existent. Staff can't speak basic English and are constantly on their mobiles!!! You will not feel safe here especially if you have children. Awful!!
0	Very disappointed. We were very disappointed in this hotel. The cable was out our entire stay, the pool was not filled (in july) and the bar/restaurant was closed. We wernt told about any of this. Was not worth the amount we paid. Very disappointed!
0	Terrible. Most disgusting place I have ever stayed. Dirty smelly and unexpected vistors in the middle of night who had been given a door key from reception! Reported this incident to reception after getting rid of the man. She just laughed said the man was booked in the following day. After making further inquiries no one can be given a key... More
1	MUSC Interview. Hotel and room were very clean. I didn't need any extraordinary service but the staff was friendly and helpful during check-in and check out although they were a little slow and there was a ~5 min line for both. Free breakfast was the usual for a holiday inn express, which is pretty good as far as free breakfasts go. I walked from the hotel to Hominy Grill for dinner (.6 miles) and to MUSC for an interview. You are pretty close by but you have to cross multiple busy streets without a crosswalk or traffic light so it would not be walkable for everyone. Parking is free and the lot seems adequately big.
0	What a Ripoff. Charged me for the night that didn't stay. I booked through Booking.com and kept telling me to contact Booking.com and they didn't take any responsibility. There are no confirmation emails or calls for my booking. 0 customer service.Myat Thu L - After reviewing your reservations. I show 2 rooms that were booked for arrival of 12/06/15 through a third party website. You should have received confirmation for these bookings through the third party you booked them through.

0	It was bad to stay there. Building was old, rooms shabby, locker broken, shower rusty, carpet sticky, mattresses flabby, faulty intercom, AC non functioning, lots of insects bed-bugs. Breakfast available is a misleading statement, there is No free breakfast. Breakfast is available on payment. Staff was rude had poor management. Only thing good was its location.You should only stay here if u intend to carry along lots of bed-bugs back your home.
1	Diva Love!. My family and I had an amazing experience at hotel diva! From the great location, one of a kind interiors to their mid afternoon sake treats, hotel diva is a must stay to get the most out of your San Fran trip. Our host Kendra was so cool, kind and accommodating considering it was one of the busier weekends in the area (an international half marathon was happening a few blocks away). She and all her staff treated us all like VIPs! I'd highly recommend staying here!Dear Andro A,Thank you for sharing your experience at Hotel Diva with Trip Advisor. I'm glad you and your family enjoyed your stay with us. Kendra would like to extend her appreciation for your kind words. We look forward to welcoming you and your family back to Hotel Diva. Best regards,Virgil LopezHotel Manager
1	Continental breakfast a little misleading but we forgive you!!. As with other reviews, in spite of the freeway noise the hotel is above par, on the older side but extremely well maintained. A small but clean pool... a fitness room would be a plus. The neon sign claims that the staff are friendly - that is true - it also states that the hotel provides a continental breakfast. For some hotels that would be a few muffins, cold cereal and packet of bagels.... not so here. Cheese omelettes, bacon and hash browns as well as biscuits and gravy, lots of fruit and greek yogurt, and of course the obligatory muffins and bagels. This, in my estimation is not a continental breakfast but a great well balanced meal with lots of options. Would we stay there again... in a heart beat!!! Thank you for being a part of our weekend getaway. Location very central for out Annie Russell theater trip, dinner in Winter Park, Global Energy 10K at Festival park and Cirque du Soleil at the Amway.Thank you for providing us with your review of our property. I'd like to start by thanking you on behave of our staff and I'm glad that we were able to help enhance your time with us. Instead of having a fitness room, we did just put into action a new Fitness-in-a-bag system. We do not have the fitness room, but we offer this instead, so that guest may still be able to exercise in the comfort of their rooms with some of the fitness gear provided in the bag. We hope that you do choose to stay with us again soon.
0	Serious safety Issues. My grandson was locked in the bathroom for 45 minutes due to faulty bathroom door locks. Hotel staff had no idea on how to get him out. My husband figured out what the problem was with the door and got him out. Now my grandson never wants to stay in any hotel ever again!!! Traumatic experience!!
0	Most of the amenities of a low budget motel, but without the we care attitude.. Spent 45 minutes booking directly with Kimpton, with another 15 directly with the hotel only to discover 30 seconds on TripAdvisor would have yielded a better rate. An no, they don't price match, they just talk around the problem. We arrived to find a room so tiny it didn't even have a closet. We inquired, and I guess closets are for higher level Karma members. Only one robe was met with a promise that we wouldn't be charged for the second (Want a robe each Stay elsewhere.) The nightly screaming and partying from the neighboring room was not met with a room change but an lecture on how thin walls are in Chicago. The second night required security (twice) and no offer of a room change. We shortened our stay because it was so awful the dog, who is the greeter for an internationally known corporation and no stranger to noise, was so tired he couldn't walk, drink or eat. Bringing a dog to this hotel isn't a perk, it's animal abuse. My daughter was so tired and stressed because she was giving a presentation, she started to cry. Now for the amenities: there is coffee in the lobby in the morning because there are no coffee makers in room. Want tea in the evening Go buy some. There is a 10 in room certificate for Karma members, but that's 1 per stay, and the bottled water isn't free, it's 9. Want bottled water Try Walgreens. There is, like most mid level hotels, a wine reception from 5-6 ( shorter than most chains) but unlike most chains, there aren't even pretzels. Want a piece of cheese, fruit, vegetables or a chip Again, Walgreens. If you think this is a boutique hotel interested in offering a great vacation experience, you are very wrong. This is a for profit entity interested in warehousing corporate employees for a profit. There are two reasons to stay here: one is if your company is paying and you don't have a choice (you will then earn your road warrior status) or if there are absolutely no other rooms available in the entire City of Chicago. And then, check TripAdvisor for the best rate. And if there's a problem, don't waste your time complaining or going to management or even contacting corporate. This is a corporate hotel that caters to corporations. Individuals are irrelevant. You will get lip service but they truly couldn't care less.Thanks for taking time to provide feedback from your stay. We're sorry to see you had a less than excellent experience and would love to discuss the issues you experienced further, as this is certainly not the norm for our property. Please feel free to reach out directly at your earliest convenience to discuss. Thanks again for choosing our hotel and we look forward to hearing from you.Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager
1	Would stay here again in a heartbeat! Very Charming!. WOW did we have a good time in NOLA. It was our first time to visit this incredible city and our experience was a true delight. From the moment we walked in the door of this hotel, we felt at home. The staff was incredible. Glenn and Robert checked us in and acknowledged our 25th wedding anniversary with an upgrade. Our room (suite) was absolutely lovely, the courtyard is beautiful, the breakfast room, bar area and lobby are quaint. All of the staff at this hotel were pleasant, thoughtful and accommodating We just can't say enough good things about how we were treated and how genuinely nice and sincere everyone was. This hotel should be commended for their superior hospitality, they sure won us over. Room was quiet, breakfast was fine, just a few short blocks to Bourbon.
1	Classic, Comfortable Well-Located Hotel. From the front desk to the housekeeping staff, everyone was friendly and helpful. The property (especially the lobby area) is reflective of scene out of a classic 40's/50's movie...really cool! You enter through the street level, but you take the stairs or elevator up to the first floor where the lobby, check-in desk, bar and restaurants are located. There are 3 elevators, pretty busy during the 'rush' like check-in and check-out times, but most of the time we never had to wait too long to get into one. It helped that our room was on the 4th floor. Our room was nice, but anticipate it to be a little smaller than most, particularly the bathroom. This wasn't an issue for my husband and I, but had we brought our kid it'd have been tight. Bed was comfortable, and most of the usual amenities that you'd expect are available in the room. We LOVE the bath products...smelled marvelous! Had to request for a few more so we could take them back to Dallas with us, lol! Our room was located close to the elevator and in front of the ice machine room, but surprisingly we were never bothered by noise (and I'm a light sleeper). The rooms seemed sound-proof because we hardly heard the outside traffic noise or even from the loop train nearby. Also have to note that this hotel's location is on point. It is located in the financial/business area so keep in mind that most restaurants have limited hours during weekdays and are closed on the weekends. But we practically walked everywhere--fairly short distances to both Millennium Park area and the Magnificent Mile where you can find everything else. Also, we took the Blue line directly from O'Hare airport, and the Clark/Lake station where you'd get off is a short walk couple of blocks away from the hotel. So convenient!!Overall a very pleasant and comfortable stay. We love Chicago, and hope to return to this hotel to stay due to the lovely service we've received and how greatly located it is to everything. Wouldn't have done it any other way.Friendly and comfortable is what we aim for and we're so proud of our team! The rooms are a bit cozy, which is what you get in a historic 1920's building along with the charm! Come back soon!Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager
1	Good Value. I loved this hotel for many reasons. First of all, it was very clean. The room was spotless! The service was also good except that some of the staff were not very friendly :(. The buffet was a good value. They have cereal in little boxes with milk, the sausages which are great! They also have toast, pancakes, fruit etc. A good starter breakfast! We werent in the hotel except for breakfast and late dinner. For dinner we ordered Dominos pizza often. The rest of the time we spent in disneyworld, better than Disneyland in my opinion! Great rooms and value! Staff not so much.
1	do not stay in a front room!. I arrived after traveling for 20 hours or so and was given a great room 320. It looked the goods and was spacious..... really looked the goods. It was a Saturday night and the street noise did not let up, emergency vehicles, drunks, fights, cars honking.......even with earplugs it was impossible to sleep. Whatever you do, when you book guarantee that you don't get a street facing room.I moved to s smaller back room that was not as nice as 320 but managed to get some sleep for the remainder of my stay.- book well ahead if you are going during a conference event. I did not and paid more than 2 x what I'd expect. At regular rates it's well priced at conference rates I at least was gouged big time.- use the concierge's car service to get to the airport.....clean, comfortable, etc, etc- there is a small Thai restaurant that serves reasonably authentic Thai that's not badHi Kev O.,Thank you so much for taking the time to write such a thorough review to share with other travelers. It is very important for us to know what made your experience so special. Please let us know if we can be of any assistance in planning for your next trip to San Francisco we would be more than happy to find a room more suitable for you. We look forward to seeing you soon!Best Regards,Dana AndrewsGuest Relations
0	not satisfied. I could not get connected to wi-fi. They had to change my room because there was not any hot water. There was not any food available for lunch. The night time manager was very rude. The day-time manager was very nice and helpful and so was the breakfast waitress. I was not very happy with my stay.
0	Rodeway Inn is horrible. I would not recommend anyone stay at this hotel in Eau Claire. None of the staff have any idea whats going on when you check in. I had this hotel resereved for my wedding guests and everything got screwed up. We were all charged different amounts for our rooms, even after we were assured that we would only be charged this one amount. And the only girl who knew what was going on got FIRED!!! The NON smoking rooms were very nice but the smoking ones were horrible. Also plan to check out ...view moreon time becaue they call you right at check out time!! I would not recommend this hotel to anyone!view less
0	Never again. After reading that short term renting is a thing of the past I find myself with conflicting feelings. I stayed there many years ago the summer after 9-11. The place was a dive but all I did was sleep and store my stuff. I did several loads of washing in the basement and talked with several residents about the building and living in NY. It was great. Being so close to Lincoln Center and Central Park and the Subway was great. But I guess it will never happen again. Real Mixed feelings.

I will look into your wireless internet complaint as we recently upgraded the bandwidth to our hotel and it has been very reliable as of late. Thank you.
1	Good for the night. We stayed here only for one night, but our suite was beautiful! Modern, comfortable king size bed, outlets for charging devices, and view of the pool and well kept yard from our window. Had a drink at the skybar for happy hour which was okay... it's misleadingly on ground level in the lobby and we were the only guests there at the time and left to go somewhere else for dinner (Hooters - there's not too much walking distance to choose from).The buffet breakfast was also okay, maybe just stick with the continental or go somewhere else as it's nothing impressive. It did suffice as we were leaving for a cruise that morning, and the friendly hotel staff helped us set up a shuttle.Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts regarding your recent stay with us! It was great to read that you were so happy with your suite! We certainly appreciate any feedback you may have for us regarding our breakfast buffet and sincerely hope that you enjoyed your cruise!
0	Never ever. Never ever again. The rate for this rooms are to high. Dirty old room,smells like an ex smoking room. Keep the doors closed ,Highway behind the Window and Moskitos. Personal is not friendly. Badest Best Western i ever had.
0	Bulldoze it. Worst place I've ever stayed. Toilet leaked, shower faucet was broken. So noisy, was like sleeping on the highway. Beds old and not comfortable. Weird people lurking around. I just can't even explain how terrible it was except to say I recommend t they just bulldoze the whole thing.
0	Painful Staff - Please stay at one of the other Marriott properties downtown!. I am a native of Atlanta and have stayed at this hotel several times in the recent past 5 years. I can give them credit for consistently moving in the same direction though - DOWN. I stayed there recently for a weekend with my wife...MoreThank you very much for sharing your concerns. Please accept my sincere apologies for your disappointing experience. I have sent you a private message hoping to connect with you and have a follow up conversation. Kind regards.
1	Needed rest before a long trip. Our fight was leaving late and hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. breakfast was really good. Everything was where we wanted. Check in was smooth. The room was very comfortable and clean would recommend this hotel.Thank you so much for telling us about your recent experience at our hotel. We are so glad that you had a pleasant stay. We strive everyday to exceed our guest expectations. We look forward to serving you and your family in the future!Thank you for making it the Hampton Inn By Hilton Philadelphia Airport!Adrian Woods, Director of Sales
0	Disappointing Visit Customer Service. Management was difficult and unwilling to hear out concerns regarding my accommodations. The bathroom was unclean and patched up. Towels had random pieces of various hair on them and one had what looked like dried dirt all through it. I kept getting moths and did not know where they were coming from and the furniture had dust built up from... More
1	Great Stay. Good Place!. Hi, I bought tickets from the internet as a package with this hotel without reading any reviews in the first place. howver later we did ) and we was yeah.. scared and even chocked about others reviews. We got in touch with the travelling agency and there was nothing to do, abosolutely nothing what so ever. Hmmm.. We searched the internet and found even 200 dollars per night with bad reviews, hmmm. We my wife and I agreed upon that we would show up on our already paid stay at Days Inn and we did)! We arrived and had two pool side rooms situated on the 1st. floor. We basically invented the rooms and searched the rooms for roaches and bugs as described in previous posts. We found it very nice, comfortable beds, Wifi which worked all our stay for 15 days ). The pool was also amazing clean and house keeping was effective every morning (Hard working latin americans.) I can only tell that I didn't expected such a good service and clean place - we were ready to leave directly, but we were surprised, really!! Great place and no danger for children, we had 3 kids with us on 17, 14 and 7 years old. Absolutely no problem, respectful environment and no dirt as claimed earlier. If this place was situated in Italy, people would expect this older style. I have seen worse places in europe where its accepted because of its location on a hill side etc.
0	Will Not Return. I understand that this is an older hotel, but I would hope with the Days Inn name, it would be kept up better. The rooms are in drastic need of updating. The room was not as clean as one would expect, and the elevator was dirty. As far as the free breakfast....disappointing doesn't begin to express it. One guest advised one of the staff members that the hot food was not being kept at the required temperature (in fact, it was cold) and there was NOTHING done. The milk for the cereal was left in a pitcher on the counter to get warm. The staff that we encountered was pleasant, but it was not enough for my husband and I to stay there again.
0	stay away from this place. Rafael (manager) likes to look into peoples windows even with the blinds closed to see what you are up to while you are in your room. I appreciated the safety of his intentions but, I don't believe I ever signed up for that part of him being a manager. Joseph (male maid) likes to go into peoples rooms while they... More
1	Special and amazing place!. Stayed here a few nights before I moved to another part of the city for work. The architecture, the atmosphere, the decoration...everything is special about this place. Even in my room I could find Art Deco details. My room was compact but big enough, clean and cosy. The bed was good and the bathroom had a large walk in shower. Staff was very friendly and welcoming. You could leave your luggage in a safe place. Breakfast was good enough. The location is amazing. You only minutes away from the Chicago river and some of the famous landmarks like The Chicago Tribune Tower and the London House. Would go there again for sure!Dear KenDB1982,Thank you for taking the time out to review your stay. We are so happy to hear that you enjoyed your time here at The Freehand and that you liked the style of the hotel. We are definitely in a great location and are very lucky to have such amazing places nearby. I will pass on your lovely comments to our staff thank you again for taking the time out to give us your feedback, we hope you have a wonderful day!Best Regards,Kristen JacksonRooms Division Manager
0	No quality in it. Stayed there for 3 nights and can't wait to get out. Upon check in, there was no smile, or welcome, front desk staff looked really tired. Upon entering the room, small pieces of trash found next to sofa and bed, sign of not vacuuming. Upon entering the bathroom, ultra small space, broken towel handle, only 2 towels on rack. No sheets for sofa bed although we stated the room was for 2 adults and 2 kids. Called for sheets and pillows, went out to dinner and back, still nothing. 9am, went to front desk to get our sheets. I mean, we really don't mind to stop by the front desk if the staff had told us that she's busy. Communication broken right there. Breakfast is nothing to write home about which we expected. Breakfast area very tight and small, if you're going to eat during busy time, go early, otherwise, no table for you. Next day went to visit Atlanta, came back at night found that both bed and sofa bed were made, satisfaction didn't last 2 seconds when seeing our pillows and our kids' stuff animals were on the floor. Obviously, the maid came to make bed, threw everything on the floor, and forgot to pick them up. But that also tell us how inconsiderate were they. Would you ever throw your bed pillows on floor, and Did I mention if they even vacuum. Would not recommend, there is Residence Inn just 2 minutes away. We didn't use their kitchen, so no commend on it, we just need a place a little bigger since we have kids.Thank you for your survey. I am truly sorry about your experience with our hotel. I will address all the matters you have detailed with housekeeping, front desk and food service. Again, I am sorry for not meeting your expectations.
1	Loved it!. The Troubadour was an awesome hotel for us! I absolutely LOVED the decor. The bed side tables couldnt be beat! The roof top bar was an incredible view and it was even more special because thats where my boyfriend proposed! I couldnt ask for a better view. Its a nice central location and the food market next door was awesome! The only thing I wish was better was the valet service. They werent very timely and one of them gave us serious attitude. Other than that it was incredible and I would 100 go back!! Thank you so much for taking the time to share this lovely review of your stay with us at The Troubadour. It was truly our pleasure to be a part of this special moment and congratulations on your engagement. We appreciate having you stay with us and look forward to having you back as our guest anytime your travels bring you back to New Orleans.Best regards,
1	An afternoon treat in the King Cole bar. We took a break from shopping and treated ourselves to a cocktail in the famous King Cole bar at the St Regis. Great experience, it was fairly quiet and we were able to enjoy our drinks and have a chat with Mathias - who made our visit a fun experience.Can certainly recommend and will try to return before we head back to England!Dear grarus, Thank you for visiting our King Cole Bar, the home of The Bloody Mary and Maxfield Parrish Art Nouveau masterpiece the mural behind the King Cole Bar. We are thrilled you enjoyed your drinks. We hope you have a chance to visit again before your trip back to Europe. Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager
0	Very disappointed in Days Inn. I booked this hotel through a major web site. I was told I would get a king size bed, smoking room with refrig, microwave coffee maker. When I got there the man at the desk said I get a smoking room with 2 double beds, He said thats what the web site sent to them. I dont believe that, he wouldnt show me. So I had to take it. The elevator sounded like it was on its last leg. The carpets were filthy, no coffee maker, the mattresses and boxed springs must of been 10 yrs old very uncomfortable, even holes in the sides, pillows felt like shredded foam and to make matters worse, there were cob webs all up the walls and corners by the sink. The television was old in a huge coffin like tv stand, no channel guide, no dresser and no comfortable chairs. For a few dollars more I will go across the street next time.
0	The hotel is tired!. All the staff all looked unhappy, and miserable, I think the hotel is in dyer need of some TLC. Or serious attention. Quite lacking for its position and pricing. Waiting staff in the breakfast area were very helpful and attentive. Thank god the friendly staff next door at the Fontaineblur were there to save the days n nights!
0	It seemed to be a half way house!. Stayed in the hotel to try it out after very fond memories of staying in the Staybridge Suites in Ballantyne, NC (I did a company relo and my family lived in this hotel for 6 months - just a great place). I travel to Virginia for business quite frequently and wanted to try out a new hotel. I typically stay... More
1	Nice surprisr. My husband, daughter and I visited Orlando for a funeral. It was a stressful time and we had to book on very short notice. This hotel worked out very well. The beds were comfortable. The rooms clean, fresh and nice looking. Nothing fancy but unpretentious. It's three minutes to the airport so great for early flights. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet. Everything was fresh and came with the room for an extra 10 and the waitress was really pleasant. The pool looked nice though we didn't have time for a swim. My daughter stayed on the pullout couch. It was not comfortable but she didn't mind and enjoyed the private space. This is not close to the parks so I would not recommend for an Orlando vacation. It is close to downtown, which is experiencing a nice resurgence. There are decent chain restaurants and big box stores (e.g. Petco) within walking distance. We were sorry to hear of the reason for your trip and would like to express our condolences. Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts about our property and we are glad that everything was conducive to your needs. We would enjoy welcoming you back for a different circumstance next time your travels bring you to our area!
1	Best in show!. While walking Mid Town Manhattan, and Central Park, we found the best place to relax and enjoy a nice drink. Inside the Ritz sits a very nice, but small, intimate bar. We found service to be what you expect , outstanding! Simply put, they remember clients by your last names, and are very friendly as well. You feel like they are truly glad you stopped by. Norman has been there for 30+ years, and has the best Irish coffee recipe I have ever had. Drinks are generous, poured the old fashioned way, and served with a warm smile! The decor is classic, upscale,staff friendly and not at all stuffy. We came back the next evening for our last evening meal during our visit in NYC.
0	Dont sell your familes health for a discount. We stayed there for multiple nights and from a family of six three of us became sick and after passing it off as exhaustion we later found black mold on our clothes. Headaches sore throats and rashes and coughing all night .we stayed in a room right across from the pool which may have increased the mold and to honest I'm not from a high humidity area so maybe this is common but we have stayed other places in Anaheim for longer and have not experienced this. Everyone says we just need a place to sleep and nothing great .that's what you get here.
1	Nice service. The Hilton Miami Airport Blue Lagoon is a nice hotel to stay. Very close to Miami airport, a few options to eat nearby, comfy rooms, good gym and the breakfast was the best part of my stay. Looking forward to having that breakfast again :)Dear AleP219, Thank you for taking a moment to share your experience. I am pleased to hear you found our hotel and amenities to your liking and you enjoyed our breakfast, which is top notch and always fresh. We are thrilled to hear about your positive experience! We look forward to welcoming you back to our hotel in the not too distant future.Sincerely, Emily Varela Guest Service and Engagement
0	Not what it seems!. There are two different sections to this hotel: the nice part, called The Chelsea, and the not so nice part, called The Annex at The Chelsea. When I made the reservation, it was not specified which section my room would be in. I guess I ended up booking a room in the Annex part, which was obviously falsely advertised. They must use the picture from their nicer rooms to advertise because this room was a piece of crap. Crumbs on the floor, chewed gum on the bed headboard, lineoleum sink top was peeling off, dresser drawers were broken, and dust everywhere. Thumbs wayyyy down!
0	Awful wifi. I had zero cell reception with my carrier T-Mobile. Not the hotel's fault. But because of that, I needed regular Wi-Fi reception. This hotel, unfortunately, had awful wifi. I was on the first floot, at the end of the hallway. They need more or better...MoreWe wanted to take a second and thank you for your review of the Hampton Inn in Gloucester. You are correct that T-Mobile has very poor if any reception in our area. We are aware of the poor internet reception BUT we have great news!...More
0	WORST... HOTEL... EVER!!!!. Save your money- this was the worst hotel in which I have EVER stayed!!! We should have just turned around and left when we pulled into the hotel parking lot and saw a police cruiser sitting out front. The hotel stay went downhill from there. The side lot of the hotel is poorly lit and we did not feel safe parking there. There were ants in the shower, the linens were ripped, and the window had a 1/2 inch of dirt on the sill. Supplies to make a cup of coffee were in the room, but there was no coffee maker. We called the front desk to arrange for shuttle to the casino and were told it would be a 20 minute wait. After 30 minutes, we walked out to the front desk to find out how much longer it would be. The staff informed us that they had forgotten to put us on the list for the shuttle... we would have been waiting forever!! I plugged my cellphone in to charge overnight, and awoke to find that it had not charged at all... the outlet had no power supply.
0	Awful sadly affordable. Had to change rooms multiple times due to the condition of the rooms, most likely this is a where the not so decent people come to score
0	Worst Experience with a Hotel Ever. We got to the hotel about an hour or two early and asked if we could check in early and the receptionist said no, not until check in time. Understood so me and my friend grabbed food. We got back to the hotel and checked in. We walked into our first room and it was a disaster. There were holes in the bed sheets and they had a rank smelled. We went back to the front desk and changed our room. In the second room, the bed sheets had black stains and rips in them. So I went back to the front desk and changed again. The third room - one of the beds had holes and rips in the bed sheets. I went back to the front desk and expressed my frustration. She said she would have a house maid change the bed sheets. The next morning when we went to shower there was only 1 bath towel in the shower. We called the front desk and they said they would have towels to our room quickly. About 30-40 mins later, a hotel maid comes to our door and hands us a small face/hand towel saying all the other towels are getting washed right now. This was the worst hotel experience I have ever had.
0	Go somewhere else. Staff had a uninterested attitude. Room and bathroom were dirty. Breakfast was frozen tacos or sausage biscuits that needed to be microwaved. This review needs two hundred characters. The review still needs a few more characters.Greetings Thank you very much for taking the time to review our property.Your input, and the feedback from all of our guests is vitally important to us and we always want guest expectations to be met upon arrival.We hope to see you again in the future and you can reach us directly at (214) 353-8774 if I can be of any assistance.
1	Luxury and relaxation close to Suntrust Park. Had a corner room with a view of the ballpark across the highway. Our king suite was spacious and comfortable and the king bed with extra pillows was super comfortable!! The entire place was spotless and obviously well kept. The front desk even brought me up a complimentary razor when I called and asked if I could purchase one. The walkway over to the ballpark was a short walk and saves a hassle on game day parking as well as saves you a buck. We will be returning soon!I am glad you enjoyed your stay and look forward to have you back!
1	Just shy of 5. Everything from the room, to customer service was excellent. The Downside was just the breakfast items, they just were not up to par and took forever to get certain items. We didnt get a chance to hang out at the pool but were told bully other guests that it was amazing.Thank you for your kind review at the Hilton Garden Inn Dallas/Market Center. I'm pleased to hear your accommodations were to your liking and the staff made your stay enjoyable as we always strive to please each and every guest. We look forward to welcoming you back soon and hope you had safe travels back home!
0	Too bad. They don't cancel a reservation even when requested a week ahead of time. Be careful when you book this inn. I had to throw my money since they didn't give me a refund. TOO BAD!!!
0	Not a fussy traveller... but would NEVER return here. Ok.. before I start the review - Can I just say that I always stay at budget hotels and never really have any issues.The continental plaza is by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. We arrived on the 23rd of December and Natalia was on the front desk, probably the best member of staff that they have, and we had to change room 3 times due to the disgusting smell. We settled on room 408 (top floor and has a view of wet n wild and Universal-one of the only good things about the place.) One way i've been describing this place to friends is for them to think of 'my name is earl'. Basically you enter the room on a balcony and the outside wall is 1 big window.. so you can't leave the curtain open at all if you're in the room! There isn't a window to open either .. so the only way to get air into the room is with the air con which is loud! The rooms smell of damp and the closets have mould patches on them. The cleaners didn't clean the rooms on a daily basis even though the latest we left was around 11am (we even left some crumbs on the floor to see if they hoovered, but they were still on the floor for about 3 days). The sheets smelt weird and im pretty sure the top cover has never been washed! The hairdryer didn't work... there was no Iron in the room although there was an ironing board! The Safe didn't work at first! There were weird brown stains on the bath. The Fridge was so cold that everything we put in there was frozen solid by the next day. Some of the good things- 15 min walk to Universal Studios, Wet n Wild over the road and and iride stop outside the hotel. BUT there are so many hotels close by and you'd get these benefits and a nicer hotel! If this hasn't put you off then you'll have to learn the hard way! We had to and stayed there over Christmas! we even booked a night at a different hotel for 1 evening! Don't do it!
1	Nice property, clean and efficient. If you are looking for a clean, well-run hotel, here it is. Accommodations can be pricey in San Diego because of the great weather and many sights to see. However, this motel offers easy access to the freeway, is reasonably priced and pleasant to stay in. Friendly welcome and nice atmosphere. The street is busy but we heard no traffic noise. Good choice for families or business travel.Dear Rose C.Your review is exactly what we strive for, as obviously already know this site is all about guest satisfaction and we tend to rate highly with guests who want to get the most for their dollar, value cleanliness, appreciate genuine hospitality and have done their research.Thanks for choosing us, and for telling the world about it!* Book Direct with Us - For the Best Service, Selection, and Value! * Len ReganGeneral Manager
0	Cleanliness Issues. From the time I checked in (the employee on duty had no other reservations she was working on, but acted quite put-upon to even check me in and continued with her attitude for the time I stayed) until I asked to cancel the rest of my reservation I felt very uncomfortable at this hotel (previously called the Limited Inn).

1	This Hotel ROCKS! It was wonderful.. We booked a Partial View room, and requested a particular room number, and this exact room number was reserved for us. The room is very spacious, the view of the ocean is perfect. There is a large bathroom very new and modern, a comfortable king bed with lots of pillows, a pull out bed in an adjacent loveseat, a refrigerator, desk, and safe. There is complimentary Keurig Coffee and a coffee maker in the room. The Continental Breakfast was very well stocked, and super good. There are 2 large fish tanks near the breakfast area to enjoy. The staff are very friendly and knowledgeable. This hotel is centrally located on the boardwalk, and there are many places within walking distance to eat and drink. The beach is just steps away from the hotel. You can not do better that this hotel for the area. AAAA++++++
1	Last minute stay. My daughter and I usually stay across the street from the Disneyland main gate. This was a last minute trip and Pavillions was the only place available. What a pleasant surprise. Very friendly and helpful staff. We were able to buy to park hoppers at a discount. The room was clean and comfortable. Wifi worked well. The grab and go breakfast snacks were nothing special. The walk to the parks was doable. We cut through the cast member parking lot across the street to Disneyland Hotel and onward to Downtown Disney. Sometimes we used the Monorail. It cut out a lot of the walk. The only downside for me is no in room safe. In the future I will still try to stay on Harbor Blvd. but wouldn't hesitate to stay here if that didn't work out.Thank you for your recent stay with us at the Best Western Plus Pavilions. We are please you enjoyed our hotel and staff and look forward to seeing you on future trips to the Anaheim area. Thank you again.
0	WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!!. My fiance and I have a one year old daughter and wanted to have a nice night out just the two of us. I had only heard good things about the Chelsea, and the price range was very good for a Saturday night. We checked in around 10:30 pm. The first room they gave us had a leak in the bathroom, resulting in water all over the floor. The bathrooms were so outdated - like straight out of the 50's tile etc. We called maintenance and they sent us to another room. The bed was decent, but everything else was falling apart. The shower head was coming out of the wall, and when you turned the shower on water leaked all over because there were holes in the tile near the knobs. The light fixture in the room was busted in. It was just grimey and disgusting. Oh, and I can't leave out the fact that our room overlooked the lovely streets of Atlantic City where we heard EVERY car system bumping, people yelling, sirens and other loud noises all night long. Plus the fact that we heard every noise from the rooms next to us, people BANGING on doors, running and yelling down the hallway. Neither of us slept a wink, which was the whole purpose of our peaceful night out. After being up all night, finally at 5 am we proceeded to the front desk to check out. We told them that we never complain, but it was a terrible experience and I even showed them the pictures I had taken of everything that was broken and dirty in our room. Not to mention the entire building smelled like marijuana and vomit. They didn't even give us a refund, nor offered to comp anything. I WILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN OR REFER PEOPLE HERE! So much for a nice, quiet, romantic night out!!!!
1	Modern Accomodations. I used to live in Phoenix and I recently moved away. I love this area because of the restaurants and places to drink. I stayed here for a wedding that was at the Phoenix Art Museum and couldn't be happier with my stay. The hotel is very open and has a modern feel. The bar and restaurant are has covered outdoor seating if you want to enjoy some rays while enjoying a bite to eat. The Vietnamese Iced coffee drink was my favorite at the bar. The pool was on the smaller size and there weren't that many loungers to lay on, but there was good sun and good tunes. The studio room was modern, had a ton of towels, 2 bathrobes, and 2 slippers. The room is what I would want in a studio apartment with a comfy bed, a place to sit and drink coffee, and a desk for doing office-y type stuff. I don't like putting my clothes in drawers, so it wasn't a problem for me that there weren't any drawers or cabinets. A lot of places to hang your suits/dresses if you're in town for business or a wedding. Thank you so much for this awesome review. We hope you will choose us again when you make it back it to Phoenix.
1	Perfect spot to stay in downtown Seattle!!. Had an extended weekend stay to celebrate big anniversary! This hotel looked very nice and had a perfect locale so we took a chance. We made a great choice! The hotel is perfectly clean and very large. We got a suite with a bay view and it was perfect. We even had a view of the famous red Public Market sign! No trouble locating Pike's Place with that view! Room was spotless and bed super comfy. Pillows are little lacking too soft, no support but we still slept really well. Check in was a breeze. When they heard it was our 25th, the gal comped our valet for the entire stay and sent up a bottle pinot grigio! We appreciated her thoughtfulness and enjoyed the wine. Bathroom is luxurious and spotless. Huge shower and separate huge tub were glorious! First time spending a significant amount of time in Seattle and we loved every minute. Thanks Hyatt, we'll be back!
1	Nice hotel with exceptionally good staff!. All of our requirements were met at the hotel, and my wife and I were very grateful to the friendly staff at the hotel. I wish that I knew the names of the staff members at the reception area with whom we had contact, so that I could commend them, individually... but, anyway, they were all obliging and helpful. The breakfast area staff and housekeeping staff (esp. Vilma) were great, as well. The hotel's location (in the center of Waikiki) was good, too. If I had to criticize anything at the hotel - (1) the egg preparations at breakfast could possibly be better and more varied (from day to day) and there could, maybe, be more breakfast meat options (instead of just the alternating bacon-and-sausage option) and (2) the shower/tub in our room was a bit dated (although it worked OK, and was never a real problem).Aloha Jerome S,Mahalo for staying at the Waikiki Gateway Hotel. I am glad that you enjoyed your renovated room and our fantastic location within a short walk of all that Waikiki has to offer as well as several convenient transportation options right at our doorstep. Our friendly staff is legendary for their Love Aloha and I am glad that you enjoyed their warm hospitality. We are currently renovating our bathrooms and I would be very excited to have you came back and see the finished product. I hope we see you again soon.Love Aloha,Kai
0	Not Impressed. I was lead to believe through your site that pets were welcome and no extra fee was charged, then when I got there they told me I had to pay x-amount a day but since the only person staying the next night was my grandmother and I would be leaving with my cat that was all I would be charged but then I was charged 2x more and they said there was nothing they could do about this. I even confronted the same person and asked why I was paying 2x more and that this was not what you told me the day before, he said he was sorry, but I was to pay 2x more. I will never go to Days Inn again, x amount a day is ridiculous.
1	Great location for seminars and similar events. The hotel is quite close to the airport and offers free shuttle which is very convenient. In spite of proximity noise is rarely a bother. Bedrooms have a decent size and so do the bathrooms and housekeeping do their job quite thoroughly. Toiletries are nice, no showercap so bring yours if so needed. Towels very good quality. Mattress comfortable and so are pillows. Complementary good quality coffee and tea (would love some cookies).Staff is super friendly and will go out of their way to make you feel comfortable.The place is quite far from city at some 35USD in regular taxi and about half with Uber. There's a nice outlet close by and the blue line is relatively close. However, this is not a convenient place if you are visiting Chicago as will take you a while to get there, is great though for conventions and similar events. Has parking places but you may want to check price beforehand.Wifi great and tech support simply too good to be true. The restaurant has great options and both wine and cocktails selections very good but perhaps a bit pricey.If they also had shuttles for the city would be paradise. In any case highly recommendable for the kind of situations described above.
1	Braves Game. We stayed three nights at the Renaissance. When we arrived the bellman were great. They helped us get everything to the room and were very friendly. Everyone was nice and helpful. We had a problem with the remote and they sent someone up within 30mins to fix it. Hotel was very clean and quiet. They only person that didn't have a smile on her face was the lady who worked at the coffee/breakfast station by the entrance and she wasn't very friendly. We stayed in room 1234 and we had a great view of Sunburst Park. We opted for the package that included breakfast and the ballpark view. Breakfast was good, refrigerator in the room kept things cool and they had a microwave by the vending machines on the floor you could use. At night our room would go from cold to hot quickly. The air conditioner was running, it could've been us. Loved the extra room in this particular room. We had 2 queen beds, and plenty of extra room to move around in the room. NOW ONTO THE WALK TO THE STADIUM... So to get to the walkway over the interstate, you have to go to the back of the parking lot, up the side of the shopping center and then you are at the overpass. We were pushing two strollers and it wasn't very stroller friendly. When you get on the walkway, it is uphill most of the way and it ends in the red parking lot. The walk back is also terrible. We didn't ask the hotel if they provided transportation to the game because we have 2 strollers. If they do, I would suggest you take it or if they don't they need to provide transportation and make the passover easier to access. It's the first year and I know they will work out all of the kinks.Thank you for the helpful feedback, I appreciate it. There are a couple of different ways to get to the pedestrian bridge where you do not have to go uphill or use stairs. The next time we will direct you through the mall that is connected to us, it will take you directly to the bridge. I appreciate your business and hope to see you back!
0	Stay Away DIRTY SMELLY. Had 3 rooms for our group. One door wouldn't hardly lock. Had strong animal smell. We stayed 5 nights and they did not clean our room once. Definately would not recommend this hotel. Worse hotel I have ever stayed in.
1	Wonderful room at an outstanding price. Don't believe the negative reviews we stayed at this hotel for four nights and looked forward to coming home each night. My girlfriend used to work at a hotel and she thought the room was typical of hotels costing 50 more a night. Clean room, comfy bed, nice bathroom, friendly staff and free shuttle to the metro, which is half a mile away (takes about 20 mins to ride to Capitol). We heard sounds from neighboring rooms only once, and the noise was faint. Only complaint was the room service - it took 75 minutes to arrive but they gave it to us free. Reading other reviews, we were a little worried about the neighborhood. Don't be. Yes, it's not the best part of town but those who call it a ghetto are way off. We walked to the metro once (and back at night) and we always felt safe. This is a great way to see DC and not spend a ton at a downtown hotel.
1	Great Location, Cozy Rooms, Choose a High Floor. I stayed here during Oracle OpenWorld, which if you know of it is a massive event in San Francisco. Rates were great, and we booked several rooms here due to its close location to the Moscone Centre.Location - excellent just a half block away from Union Square! Convenient to walk anywhere downtown, or hop on a cable car, although not in walking distance to Fishermans Warf. Also just a few blocks from the metro station, with dozens of restaurants nearby.The lobby is elegant - you can feel the history when you enter, and their sherry in the evenings is an interesting feature.I lucked out with a room on the top floor facing Post Street. I wouldnt say there are any good views here, being San Francisco with skyscrapers surrounding it. I say lucked out as there was no-one above us, so we didnt have any foot noise above us, which others experienced.Rooms are tiny - think of European style with limited room if you have two double beds. Very limited space to use the desk, and if youre sharing, youll have to stack your luggage somewhere to be able to walk around. Same applies to the bathrooms, with some limited space.For summer, there is NO air conditioning. The only way we survived was to keep the window open and deal with the street noise - although there was a ceiling fan. However, it only moved hot air, unless you opened the window.Rooms have modern conveniences - flatscreen TV, fridge, etc., but I was told by the front desk staff that they wouldnt drink the water themselves. Meaning bring lots of bottled water, as the in-room Smart Water is quite pricey.There is no gym in the hotel, but apparently one close by - not sure about it, as I just elected to run outside.Hotel staff are friendly, the location is great, and Im sure its a nice location for a romantic trip - but not the best for business, or sharing a room.
0	Extremely poor Management. During our stay at this establishment a lead assistant and a manger handled themselves extremely poorly. They were involved in a conflict which lead to very disappointed children and adults. The management needs to be retrained in customer service and not yell and have attitude with guest. They truly do not know how to run a business and should be... More
1	SUPER NICE HOTEL!!. SUPER NICE HOTEL!! Highly recommend it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Super friendly staff, rooms are really really clean, delicious hot and cold breakfast items (complimentary) and are replenished the entire time, so you don't get left with the scraps if your running late, 24/7 hot fresh coffee in the lobby, and they even have yummy fresh cookies on the front desk to grab after a long day at the job. It's the small things, like the receptacle outlets located ABOVE the nightstand so you don't have to do furniture reconfigurations to plug in your phone! The internet stays on. Yea, it really stay on all the time with no unexpected drops. Also, the TV is real TV....not the Hotel-Guided limited channel system. So, believe me when I say this is a nice hotel. It really is. ) It's safe....quit looking.....book, now.
1	Safe, Clean Well Located Property Close To Old Town San Diego. Stayed 2 nights in April 2013. Well maintained and nicely landscaped property. The property is on a hill overlooking the Main Street of old Town San Diego with more Mexican restaurants than you ever thought possible. Getting back to your room on the hill may be a workout since you are going uphill. Bed was very comfortable and firm as that is my personal preference. The property covers 5+ acres so navigating the several different buildings can be a little tricky although they provide a colorful property map. The property is definitely older but it is clean and I did feel safe there at night although it is not the best lit property at night. Rooms are a little dark, however, and my room did not have a balcony and am not sure any did. They have two parking garages but small. They do charge 14/night extra for self parking. Overall, a good stay if you are looking for a sale, clean comfortable place to use as a base to do the tourist thing.Thank you for making the Best Western PLUS Hacienda Hotel Old Town your base for San Diego adventures! We appreciate the thoughtfulness you put into your review. It will be helpful for guests planning travel. If you have a specific preference of room location, please dont hesitate to ask before your next stay. Six of our eight buildings have elevators and our team is always ready to show guests all our property has to offer as well as assist with luggage. Please call ahead so we can greet you as a returning guest!
0	Very, very disappointed with this dump. I've heard such great things about the Chelsea, but their Annex is a dump. It really is. My bathroom was filthy. Neither my bathroom light nor my entryway light worked- we just had to use lamps. The room smelled like smoke or a gross cleaning agent, I couldn't tell. The walls are paper thin- I could hear a casual conversation in the room adjacent to ours. Even the elevator had 3 holes in its walls! Great location to Tropicana, but we won't stay there again.
1	Best Bar Staff Ever!. Recently stayed at this property and had the pleasure of meeting Sue, Lisa and Paul at the bar in the lobby. The ambient was very open and friendly, they made suggestions of where to eat and when we came back from dinner they followed up on how the other place was. Great service and always with a smile on their face! Recommend 100Evi - thanks for your 100 recommendation. I'll be sure and share your nice comments with our team and especially Sue, Lisa and Paul in the Nox Creek Lobby Lounge. We look forward to your next visit.
1	great place to stay. This hotel is great!!!! The staff are friendly and helpful. Great cocktail hour and a pretty good breakfast. The rooms are nice and a good size. Great parking rate! You get some great extras with your stay which is nice. The hotel is next to a trolley car stop which is nice. FYI if you have never been to the city buy an all day pass for the trolley. Its 3 per person for all day on and off stops. best deal around. It includes the buses in that pass as well. I have only two minor complaints and one is that the food during cocktail hour did not have healthy options for those that are watching their diet. The other was that we were next to the housekeeping closet and they were kindof loud early in the morning. Overall great experience and will book this hotel again!!!!
1	Very clean and Comfortable. Very clean, very modern Shower curtain should have been changed, it was vile, but within 10 minutes, it was changed and the staff were apologetic. Our room had a view of the freeway which we liked. The man checking me in was LOUD! like everyone in the lobby knew what room I was in, my name and my address because he was just loud, but I only spoke to him the one time so that was good. Complimentary drink coupons at check-in for happy hour at the bar were a nice touch. Very comfy bed an super squishy pillows. Very happy with the visit.
0	This is the WORST hotel and the WORST staff.. The staff here is horrible and the manager sucks!! The hotel was dirty and the bathrooms were disgusting and had no soap, the manager was extremely rude and inconsiderate and I will make sure none of my friends or family goes here, they are mean.
1	wonderful experience. we had an amazing time at this hotel def coming back for our next family vacation room was nice and cold and clean and for a decent price the staff was also very helpful and polite. Breakfast was good Dear Edith,Thank you for taking the time to leave us honest and detailed feedback on your recent stay with us.

0	Good for one night. Room appeared to have new mattresses which was good to see because I was a little skeptical after the looks of the rest of the hotel. Now they need to spend money on new pillows. The one I had was very lumpy therefore I did not sleep well. New towels would also be a nice touch. Didn't have time to... More

0	Shouldnt Have to GO to Head OFFICE to Get Result. We had no tv service and was told we could move or we could be taken care when we checked out.. we chose to stay in the room as we where unpacked , it was late and we were ready for bed. When we checked out we where then told we had to talk to the manager as we booked thru expedia. It took over week to track the manager down (i left at least three messages on her voicemail). Only to be told that their policy was to move us ... she was rude in her dealing with the situation...thats not what we where told at the time...when I pushed it i was given the option of 10 off my next stay..also ...it was a long weekend and the hotel was busy ... the breakfast area needed attended to...food running out and a little cleaning was in order...the front desk person was friendly and did her best to replenish and a very bus time for her at the desk...when i asked housekeeping for a new ice bucket (as ours had a crack in it and was leaking) she rolled her eyes at me and sighed like i was putting her out... this hotel could use some renovatons and attention in order to be up to Ramada standard. P.S. I fly alot and have used this hotel at least 3 or 4 times .... there will not be another stay there. and not recommending it.
0	No, no, no, never again!. Just dreadful, and scary. Was traveling alone with my dog. We were so tired, just needed somewhere to rest. What a filthy room, and the door did not shut tightly, you could see light through it...which wasn't too huge a problem until I was awoken in the middle of the night to loud party or something, which quickly turned into... More
0	I wouldn't suggest staying here.. The photos are very misleading. The ceiling in my room and bathroom was falling and bathroom full of mold. I complained but was told there was no other room available. I listened to numerous complaints from other guests while I waited in line to complain. The front desk gentleman was indifferent to the complaints and not much was resolved. I was in town for business and have never stayed in a worse down town 'hotel and conference center' in the hundreds of cities I've traveled to.
0	Stay Somewhere Else. The minute you step into the room at the Crowne Plaza Nashua, you can see that the they haven't been redone in decades. The wallpaper is even peeling off in the bathrooms. This kind of neglect can be forgiven if the room itself is comfortable. Unfortunately that was not the case. The bed in our room was one of the... More
1	Wonderful hospitality that's genuine. From the moment we stepped up to the checking desk to the time we left, the checking staff and the food-service people were warm, hospitabie, courteous, and competant. They seemed that they truly wanted our stay to be wonderful. The hotel was nice, and well located. They offer complementary breakfast, afternoon popcorn and sodas, and their 5:30 Kickback. I thought this was a little snack...but no, its a full meal with drinks included (beer, wine or cocktails). What a pleasant surprise after traveling all day we didn't have to find a restaurant! Tanya, Vickie Tyrone were extremely warm and kind to us the entire week. Drury should give these people a raise for the wonderful face they give to the property! They each went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we could want. Thanks gang for a wonderful week! We were so pleased with the warm reception of these folks that we'll look for Drury properties when we next travel.
1	Great price. Staff was great. Close by so many attractions. FREE parking and FREE WiFi. Rooms are decent for what youre paying. No complimentary breakfast, no acces to a microwave. Other than that it was a great experience, had no trouble at Check out. Thank you for the great review of our property and for being our guest. We are happy to hear you enjoyed our convenient location which is close to all of San Diegos attractions. We are also pleased to hear you took advantage of our free parking and Wi-Fi. We look forward to the opportunity of welcoming you back on your next visit. Thank you!
1	Excellent service, beautiful room gorgeous view. We live in Seattle but needed to get the baby out of our condo while it was cleaned. He had been sick for two weeks and needed fresh air while our tiny place was being cleaned from top to bottom. The guy in reservations got us a hypoallergenic room with a gorgeous view, crib, baby bathtub and baby products for a discounted rate. Mommy baby got much needed RR. Thank you! We will be sending our friends and family to the Grand Hyatt for the great service, beautiful rooms and gorgeous view! Room 2319 was perfect!
1	Amazing and Beautiful Property and Kalah was Awesome!. I had stopped by here with my family just to stop by. We did not stay, but rather wanted to see this new property. It is near the Napa River. There is also a Century theater and an In-Shape in the same parking lot. The grounds were immaculate. Once I walked in, all I could say was WOW!. It was beautiful, modern and I felt comfortable as I walked in. We purchased some waters from the gift shop as we were driving around through Napa, Calistoga, and St. Helena. Kalah (I believe that was her name- she had curly brown hair), was so warm upon us walking into the lobby. I asked if I could take a look around just to see what the common areas looked like, she said absolutely! It was beautiful. I am looking forward to my future stay(s) here. I will say as I passed a young lady, Danielle. It was like she did not want to be there or she was having an off day. She did not acknowledge me as a guest as she passed by or even at the desk. Overall still 5 Stars. Kalah (hopefully that was her name) was AWESOME! See you Soon!Dear LeMoura G,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. Your comments especially the Wow are bells to my ears. We truly do have a unique Hampton capturing the Napa Valley throughout the building. It was very satisfying to hear your awesome comments about Kalah. We look forward to seeing you on your next visit to the Napa Valley. Thank you, Serina Najar.
1	Give it a try!. This place is legit. It's definitely not the Marriott or Ritz Carlton but whenever you book this hotel the rate will likely be much lower than most others. If you're coming to the city to hang out in the hotel room then don't stay here....if you need a clean and safe place to sleep and cleanup at then this is the place for you. Free parking and an unbeatable location.Definitely get a room in the back of the hotel. Rooms are small but not claustrophobic. 15 min walk to Union Square. Located by several fantastic shops and restaurants.
1	BEST location in downtown Seattle. The absolute BEST location for a downtown Seattle hotel just steps from the Space Needle, EMP Museum, Pacific Science Centre, etc.. Fully equipped kitchen in the suite and LOTS of space -- larger than most one-bedroom apartments! Excellent buffet breakfast setup with top-notch food quality and very comfortable seating with views of the Space Needle, etc. The rooftop deck has lots of comfortable seating and fire pits etc,, so a wonderful place to wind down and end your day. Too bad the parking stalls are extremely tight limited however, it's to be expected for such a prime downtown location. We will be back for sure!877tiffanyl,We are thrilled to hear the Hyatt House met your needs and appreciate the positive feedback. Im glad you were able to take advantage of the kitchen facilities in the room, complimentary breakfast spread in the morning and rooftop terrace. Its wonderful to know when guests have a comfortable stay as we are grateful of the comments. We look forward to your next visit in Seattle!Sarah Junge
1	"Very pleasant weekend!. Very pleased with our overall stay. For the most part, staff friendly and helpful especially the concierge. We were disappointed with the menu at the Barbados Room. We were hoping to just enjoy a nice dinner upon our arrival and were not prepared to go searching for a reservation outside the hotel after a day of traveling. After reviewing the menu, we realized there was no real ""dinner"" menu. Just sandwiches and pizza etc. What a waste of such a lovely room. And the drinks leave a lot to be desired. Pool and outside courtyard are lovely. Hotel is very clean. We did encounter some really rude loud guests who decided to continue their party in the hallway at 3 a.m. Easter Sunday. But guess you cannot do a background check of incoming guests."
1	Luxury comfort in the heart of NOLA. We booked Nopsi for my 40th birthday and this hotel lived up to my expectations. My spouse is a lifetime Marriott Platinum member so we have had our fair share of hotel stays. The service and hospitality was amazing. The staff was courteous without feeling stuffy...the best way to describe them was authentic with a large does of Southern hospitality and they were all wonderful.They upgraded us to a better room which comprised of a wrap around view. The upgrade was complimentary even though they were fully booked. Two thumbs up and what a wonderful way to kick-off my birthday.The hotel bed is amazing. I described it as feeling hugged but not hot. I received the best sleep and my spouse said the same. I'm a side sleeper and he's a back sleeper so it's shocking that we both like the mattress.The bed was so comfortable that I emailed the hotel to get the make of the mattress and will order it for our own home.We frequented the lobby bar and the drinks were on point.I don't recall the name of my drink but it reminded me of salty plum but our bartender described it as vinegary. Personally, I thought it was well-balanced. The Frenchman was also well-made here. The rooftop bar was a scene but not compared to Orange County or LA. Much less pretentious and the skyline was pleasant.As others have mentioned, the hotel is not in the middle of the action but walking distance to Bourbon St and many of the best local restaurants (GW Fins being my fav for the grilled oysters and desserts).Bottom line, I would stay here again the next time we are in NOLA.Sara, thank you so much for choosing to stay at NOPSI! Its wonderful to learn that you had such a fun and memorable 40th birthday with us. We love making all occasions special, and were delighted to have won you over. A terrace room overlooking the city certainly provides an unforgettable experience. We hope you and your husband will make visiting us an annual birthday tradition so that we may treat you to more pleasant surprises!Warm Regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager
1	Plant a tree for us!........................ Stayed here for a week with my husband and two teenage sons, I choose this hotel because of the reviews and location.Check in and out was very efficient carried out by friendly and helpful staff, Concierge Staff were equally as helpful and professional through out the week.Our room, and indeed the whole hotel, was very clean and tastefully decorated.There was enough space for all of us and we each found the beds to be very soft and comfortable. Only downside was, although it was great to have a small coffee machine, it wasn't big enough nor did we have enough tea or coffee, or even cups for four people. I did ask on several occasions for more, but I did get fed up asking. This also went for the towels, having asked, again on several occasions, we only received three bath towels! We were there 7 days and I had paid for four adults so I am a bit of a loss why this kept happening. It was a bit irritating and slightly lacking on such a good hotel. I hope this will be rectified for future patrons.There is a small gym and a business centre with two computers and a printer, very handy for checking in to your airline and printing out boarding passes.The terrace garden is small but it was lovely to have a picnic alfresco in the city.I can't comment on the food here as we ate out all the time as there are loads of places to choose from locally. Walgreens Supermarket just up the street and left on Powell. Union Square just a little further down.In my book a clean hotel and location is key for me and the location of this hotel was spot on, easy access to all forms of transport, BART from the airport, trams, buses, muni metro and streetcar. Right next to the Chinatown Gate and easy access to all the tourist spots.We all really enjoyed our stay at this hotel and in San Francisco in general, lots to see and do and the people are really friendly and welcoming where ever we went, and to cap it all off the Giants won the World Series and we were treated to a Homecoming Parade in their honour.....awesome.This hotel has good Eco friendly practices and will plant a tree for every review posted.Thank you for your great review, and as promised, we will definitely plant a tree for you for leaving a review on TripAdvisor! As you know we do this for all reviews, but are happier when it is done for a positive review. I'm so sorry to hear that your requests for tea, coffee and towels were never appropriately met. Although it sounds like you enjoyed your stay overall, I will make sure to work with the team so that going forward they can improve their performance. I'm happy that you were able to take full advantage of the public transportation and enjoyed all the sights this beautiful city has to offer! If you ever find yourself traveling back, we would certainly love to host you again!And we agree a clean hotel and location are vital to a great staySincerely,Bruce P.Front Office Manager
1	Comfortable stay prior to flying from Orlando. The hotel was meticulously clean, well decorated and welcoming. The room was comfortable, including the bed and bedding. We stayed over night to catch an early flight from Orlando. We had parking reservations near by, so this made the hotel a good choice, meeting our travel plans. We will use this hotel again.Thank you for staying overnight at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport. We are delighted to know you were impressed with every aspect of our hotel, especially with our well-kept property and your comfortable room. We look forward to being of your service again whenever your plan brings you our way! Sincerely,Michael GoldwasserGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport
1	Friendly and helpful staff. This hotel is on the edge of the French Quarter but a short walk to all the action with lots of bars and restaurants near bye. It has a nice pool located in the centre of the forecourt with plenty of loungers and tables around it. The inclusive breakfast was good and plentiful but ends at 9.30am on a weekday with extended times on the weekend. Rooms are clean and comfortable but as is fairly common now, A/C units are located in the rooms and can get very noisy at night. If it's not too warm it would be better to keep it down or turn it off as it can disturb sometimes. Overall a very nice mid range priced hotel for the location. Staff are very friendly and able to arrange the booking of various tourist attractions if required.I am pleased to hear you enjoyed our hotel and staff.. I hope the next time you are in New Orleans you will come back and see us. Sincerely, Chastity
1	A nice little hotel that has it's own style. The hotel is quite a nice little hotel for the money you pay, especially at late notice. They handled my booking very last minute and accommodated myself at a late hour, preparing a room specifically for me. Having been in the area for a meeting I was also provided with an early breakfast which was more than adequate. The bistro at the hotel is actually really nice, I loved the food there and found myself wanting more before I left, it's a nice touch because it gave me more to do while I was waiting around. The room's are exactly how you see in the pictures and are decent for the pay, the bathrooms are very clean and seem to be maintained well. I had an issue with not being able to get hot water at one point but that was fixed within half an hour. The staff at the hotel are very friendly and happy to help, they spent a lot of time helping me find my bearings and arrange transport which I appreciated as I hadn't got a very good knowledge of the area. I did find it a bit of a trouble to get on to the wifi which was frustrating but I was given assistance and after a while it seemed to sort itself out. The style and the artwork of the place is actually quite stunning, it made me feel like I was in a special little hideaway, and the area surrounding is quiet so I wasn't disturbed at night. I may not get chance to visit the area again but if I do I would be returning here, it was a nice experience.
1	Almost 5 Stars. I got this room for 87 on Priceline with a Name Your Price room at 4 stars. I wasn't familiar with the brand, so I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived. The staff was so nice and welcoming on my arrival even though it was late. The room was very comfortable. The carry Aveda products in the bath, so that was a nice touch. It was also close to several shopping centers and restaurant options. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there was hair in several different places in my bathroom. It still seemed very clean, but definitely a let down to find that. I would stay here again at that price.I am very sorry for the way in which you found your room. I will review with my Housekeeping Manager and follow up. This is not typical at all for my hotel, we run among the highest cleanliness scores in the company. Please come back and see us soon!
0	Absolutely Disgusting!!!!. This hotel is absolutely disgusting and is in violation of choice regulations. When we checked in there was excessive dried up pee and pubic hairs on our toilet. I contacted the staff immediately and I asked the old man behind the desk for a discount and he offered to clean it. He did state that it would take some time,... More
0	Historic but uncomfortable. This Hotel, formerly a prestigious bank, may be attractive for history buffs, but is an expensive and horrible place to stay when you visit New Orleans. The rooms are SMALL, unattractive, with terrible old bedding, virtually without windows or amenities. Parking was 38/day, and it took 35 min. to get your vehicle. Almost no lobby or sitting area, the restaurant was small, understaffed, with a severely limited menu. The commode was crammed into a tiny bathroom, and we had to call down to get them to bring up an old beat-up refrigerator. There are SO Many other more attractive places to stay in New Orleans, less expensive, I would avoid this place like the plague.Thank you for your review. I'm sorry to hear that we did not exceed your expectations but we'll use this information to provide better services in the future. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to hear about your visit. Sincerely,Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
0	Weekend at Wingate. The staff were delightful and most helpful, with special mention of the front desk! Check-in was a struggle for the staff - quite a few people arrived at the same time. Fortunately for us we were related or attending the same event and were not frustrated or anxious, but there was one person at the front desk. It was unfortunate... More
0	Worst hotel ever. I am 71, have been travelling around the world all my life, and your hotel is the worst experience ever.My room has been booked through Booking.com for one month.I arrived Friday Sep 9th at 2.45 pm. I know that the check-in time is 3pm but no room was available and I had to wait till 3.15 !No luggage rack in this tiny room and I had to call three times before I got one (check the records of the Housekeepers phone)When I came back at 6 pm after having walked in the city, I wanted to take a shower. The water was cold (around 30 degrees Celsius ). The Housekeeper sent someone who was unable to fix that. So I went to the reception desk who gave me another room .The first room was on the 28th floor, the 2nd on the 4th so I had to repack and go from one room to the other 3 times THRU THE LOBBY, because the elevators are not the same . No one would ever propose to give me a hand !I gave two trousers to be washed and ironed. That was done at 8.30 and I was supposed to have them back by 6, that evening. Nothing. I had to claim them the following morning . That doesnt fit with what is written on the laundry service paper.This morning, I ordered black tea with milk in the Coffee Shop downstairs. The waitress brought me tea with bergamote, which is not a tea in which you can put milk. She had to go elsewhere to find the suitable breakfast tea, and I had to claim for sugar which was not on the table.
1	First time in Philly!. Requested a corner room with a city view at check in. The man at the reception desk graciously found the perfect room and provided it for us. The view of the city was spectacular especially at night. We received great suggestions for lunches and dinners within walking distance. One night we were too tired to eat out and snuggled into our comfy king bed and ordered room service late. It came in rapid order and was delish! Can't wait to return to Loews in Philly! Highly recommend!Thank you for your recent visit to the Loews Philadelphia Hotel. We are delighted to hear that you enjoyed your visit, especially the view from your room, our central location, and the delicious food from in-room dining. We look forward to welcoming you back for your next visit.Scott N.
1	Very pleased!!!. My husband, and I just visited San Francisco last weekend. We stayed two nights at The Orchard Garden Hotel, and we were very pleased with our stay. The hotel was clean, roomy, comphy beds, and the staff was very friendly, and very helpful directing us to different locations. I would definitely stay here again!!!Hearing that you'd definitely stay with us again has put a smile on my face. I'm thrilled that everything form the service to the room were well enjoyed by you and your husband! I certainly hope that we'll be seeing you back again soon.Safe travels,Collins C., Front Office Manager
1	Excellent hotel, a lots parking spots, great breakfast. This is an excellent hotel in my mind, there are a lot of parking spots for use, you ALWAYS can find a spot for parking any time. great breakfast with apple or banana. hot tub and swimming pool make you a enjoyable stay, very clean in room. You can enjoy very strong Wi-Fi. It is the best value for the money I paid. No safe box in room.Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts on your recent stay here at the Best Western Mission Bay. I am very happy to see you were satisfied with our rooms, staff, location,breakfast and service. I apologize for not having in room safe, though we have safe deposits available for guest at the front desk. We work hard to provide a superior guest experience, and I'm glad we were able to provide that for you. When you to return to San Diego, please do not hesitate to contact me directly at 619-275-5700 x 393 or lpradohotelpros.biz for your reservation needs.Once again, thank you for your return,Leidy PradoFront Office Manager
1	Great value and location. Overall great value for the price we paid. Rooms are clean, comfy beds, a little dated but I enjoy the retro look so worked for me!Highlight was definitely the heated pool and hot tub, our kids never wanted to leave...the grounds were beautiful and well kept. We ate at the restaurant 5 times and the food was good, nothing outstanding but hit the spot and service was great.Another bonus was that it was close to the fashion valley mall transit location so we were able to get around and see the sights and beaches with public transit easily and a day pass for adults was only 7. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend to families with kids and travelling on a budget!Thank you for the nice comments. We glad you enjoyed your stay and were able to take advantage of many of our amenities. We hope to see you again real soon. Thanks again.
0	Embarrassment to the company. We have stayed at a Hampton Inn several times because we are family of 5 and it is accommodating. Since the rate is usually between 125 and 200 you get what you pay for. This time we definitely DID NOT GET WHAT WE PAID FOR. Because it was Easter weekend, we were charged 350 per night. What we did get... More
0	So old and the smell was horrible. I went into the dark room and the lights did nothing to brighten it up. Also when I drove up I thought the place was deserted and shut down. I turned around and left...even though I was losing over 100.
0	Not even a complimentary bottle of water for 200/night. For the rate of 200, it would've at least been nice to get a complimentary bottle of water with the room. There's a hampton inn down the road that is just as 'nice', would rate as average, and provides a breakfast with the rate. I guess if you're getting reimbursed for expenses, then your rating would be higher.I am sorry to hear your stay with us did not quite meet your expectations. However, we do appreciate your feedback and thank you for sharing your experience on Trip Advisor.Sincerely,Rachel PackardFront Office Supervisor
1	Nice hotel with great location. - The Location is very good, great bed ( pillow good as well), good room and nice amenities. The staff on the reception desk and the bell mens are kindly and willing to help.-Shower is weak, can hear people talking on the other room. As it is a small hotel not a big chain doesn't have room service except for breakfast... For people who have small children it's nice to have a room with a microwave just to warm food for the baby whoever the staff was great and warmed the food for me in their backroom.It's wonderful to hear that you felt well taken care of by our staff, Miguel! I'm glad our amenities and the room was to your liking. Our entire hotel is built to meet certain eco-friendly goals, so that is the reason for the lower water pressure. If you have any questions at all or concerns about your room, please don't hesitate to let us know! Safe travels home, and we hope to see you on your next trip to San Francisco.Best,Collins C., Front Office Manager
0	Horrible Experience. Very outdated hotel rooms. TV did not work - no signal. Called desk, they said change the channel. Why, I don't know. Still did not work, they said they will send maintenance. 45 minutes later still hadn't arrived. Called desk. They said change channel. said we went throough that drill and were waiting for maintenance. Person said she would call as there was no record of the prior call. They came about 15 minutes after and had to replcae cables on tv. Extremely poor food and bar service. Ordered dinner at 10 pm (they serve until 2 am). Food finally arrived at our table around 11:40 pm. No comment from staff or anyone as to poor service. Wait staff contact with table to refill drinks, etc. during wait was once. Had to go to bar and try to flag down bartender if needed anything. Thank you for submitting a review about your recent experience. On behalf of the executive team allow me to first apologize for the service levels you experienced which failed to meet your expectations and our minimum standards. Wyndham sets the bar high when it comes to service standards, understanding the importance of taking extra steps to ensure our valued guests have a wonderful stay. I can assure you, your experience is not typical of the Wyndham Garden Dallas North and hope you give us another chance the next time you are in the North Dallas area.
1	Most excellent. I have used this hotel many times and will continue to do so. The staff members are always friendly willing to help in whatever capacity necessary. On this particular visit, they allowed us to check in a bit early so that we could actually enjoy a bigger part of our final vacation day in Orlando. In the past, we have enjoyed their buffet breakfasts which were quite delicious!It is great to hear that we were able to make your last vacation day a little more special and your kind comments have been passed on to our team members. We appreciate your business and your continued loyalty!
1	Family friendly in location, amenities and price. The Four Points was a great hotel choice for my family of 4. We booked online through their website using a AAA discount and scored a two-bedroom suite with a mini kitchenette for about 240 a night. The suite was spacious, and having a coffee maker, microwave and refrigerator made our stay in Seattle feel like staying at home. The lobby and my suite were clean, modern and renovated. The beds are comfortable -- even the convertible sofabed in the living room. The hotel is located a little less than a half mile north of the Seattle Center where the Space Needle, EMP museum and Pacific Science Center. My family had a great time in that area. The location is in what I'd consider a developing area. It's not touristy it's near a few auto shops, a business plaza and a few blocks from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. We felt perfectly safe walking in the evening and there are plenty of eating options, like a nice Pho Viet Anh and the corner QFC market which is open 24 hours.We took the monorail for 2.50 each way to get to Pike Place. That walk was a bit much for my 5 year old, so we took a taxi the next time and paid about 15-20, I believe. We stayed there for 3 days before the cruise, and I would be glad to stay there again. If you can afford it, you might want to stay closer to the Downtown area or Pike Place, but if you're looking for an affordable, spacious, comfortable and clean place, you might want to consider this place.
0	Money was stolen from our room. We are DVC members for the past 3 years and have had great experiences before this trip in late November. We had almost 500 taken from our room during our one cleaning experience. We were not aware that the room was being cleaned on day 3 of our 9 day stay. We had our money out in plain view in... More
1	perfect!. This was the hotel our son and daughter-in-law chose for out-of-town wedding guests for the days surrounding their wedding. The rooms were stylish, newly-renovated, super clean (large rain shower bathroom), and the beds were very comfortable. The staff and admin were all so welcoming and accommodating throughout our stay and even let us enjoy the pool area after checkout! There was a Happy Hour party the night before the wedding and lots of guests were hanging out around the pool for several days (and nights!) surrounding the wedding. The vibe at the hotel was very chill. The food at the hotel restaurant was very good, according to those who ate there. The day after the wedding, we were up early and had coffee from the free continental breakfast area, but walked to a nearby diner rather than wait for the restaurant to open. There was even a free yoga class going on by the pool that morning. I would highly recommend this hotel for its ambiance, value, and comfort.Seems that everyone from the wedding group enjoyed their stay last weekend and thank you for leaving us a lovely review!
0	Super 8 Vandalia, OH.. Room was dirty, black hairs and grass on bathroom floor, tub liner was disgusting, old tube style TV and only had 1 washer and 1 dryer. I have a handicap and was put on the 2nd floor about 11-12 rooms away from the elevator. No luggage carts available which made it difficult for me to bring up my belongings. I would NOT recommend this Super 8 even though it was close to all we wanted to see in the Dayton area.
1	Great 4th of July Birthday Weekend!!!. Check in was 7/3/14, and we arrived early. This front desk lady explained that we needed to wait a little longer for our room but gave us a parking voucher for our car drink coupons. We didn't mind, as it seemed there was plenty to walk around do while waiting. My birthday was the next day on July 4th our reservation was for 3 nights. I was using BWR points that I'd saved for 3 years, as I am also a Best Western employee in another town. Later at check in, a different front desk lady issued our room keys, but had us scheduled for only 1 day, (checking out 7/4/14). After I questioned her, she fixed it in the system, but did not fix my keys, even though I asked her if my keys were ok, she assured me they were. She seemed like a new employee, but said I was good to go. She did not explain that breakfast was NOT included in our stay, nor did she mention a 14 fee for the parking voucher per day. We did know about the 20 per night pet fee. We went to breakfast the next morning, July 4th, and had to pay for it. That's how we found out about the breakfast vouchers. So upon returning to our room later that morning, we were locked out! My husband was upset, so I took the long walk down to the lobby to fix it. The front desk lady was very nice fixed my keys then gave me 2 breakfast vouchers for the next day 2 more drink coupons for our trouble, and cuz it was my birthday. We ended up giving our 6 drink vouchers to a couple in the bar it made their day! Later that afternoon I ran into Douglas Frost, a Front Desk Manager. He liked my puppy Gizmo. I told him it was my birthday explained that I work for Best Western. It was a pleasure talking to him. He was genuinely concerned that we were locked out and not informed of the rules regulations of his hotel upon checking in. He said he would look into it and get back to me. He must have got busy, as I never did hear back from him. However, at check out my parking pet fees were wiped off my credit card. We did use 1 breakfast voucher on Sat another on Sun. My husband doesn't eat breakfast, but we both got to have coffee at the restaurant both days. Nancy cleaned our room that afternoon, minutes after we asked. Thank you for that. A huge Thank you to Hector the bartender for a birthday flan bowl equipped with a lit candle. The Mariachi guys sang Happy Birthday in Spanish English to me. They didn't know my name so they called me Miss America! It was really cute. Upon leaving for the fireworks show at the beach, I slipped on the curb outside the Tequila Facory, cutting my ankle foot in 4 places. The beach was beautiful, however there were no restaurants available, no restrooms available barely anywhere to stand, sit or walk. The fireworks were Spectacular! Found out the next morning that there were over 1/2 million people at the beach for the show It took us 3 hours to get back to our hotel by trolly. Overall, I appreciated the friendly personalities of TRUE Best Western Family Employees. It's easy to see that Best Western cares about their guests, regardless the circumstances. Thank you for a great time.Happy Birthday and thank you for staying with us! Your review is meaningful and we do hope to welcome you (and your pup) back to the hotel again soon.
0	Super bad staff un professional and rude.. I would advice not to go for this hotel. The staff is higly rude and they will over charge u. Very un proffessional behaviour will keep u waited un ncessary.
1	My stay. I have always stayed at Best Western when travelling and have no intention of changing. I have stayed at the Best Western in Pollock Pines in California and also the Best Western in Placerville also in California. Was extremely pleased with those two as I was pleased with Best Western Mission Bay.Hello,Thank you so much for taking time to review your stay here at the Best Western Mission Bay. Im very happy to see you would consider staying with us again.When you return to the San Diego area, please feel free to contact me for your reservation needs. You can reach me at 619-275-5700 ext 393 or Lpradohotelpros.bizWe look forward to your return!Leidy PradoFront Office Manager
1	Very excited to go back. The hospitality was the best!. Target, Wal-Mart, food establishments are in walking distance. The airport is 10 mins away and the shuttle is always available. The property is brand new, every inch of the suite/room was magnificent with the marble in the bathroom. I washed clothes (complimentary wash/dry). Loved it. Workout room has all the up-to-date equipment. Front desk hospitality from beginning to end of my stay. I'm from Los Angeles/Orange County, California, and a very neat and clean person. I will most definitely be back. The drive to Virginia Beach is very close, freeways are right at the location. Highest recommendation and respect for this hotel.
1	Great value, interesting place. The rooms are small but cozy. Very well located to many tourist locations including Pier 39 and Lombard street. Hopefully you aren't a light sleeper, though, since the walls are made of paper (not even cardboard). You can hear every little conversation. A white noise app or making use of the ear plugs provided are a must.Thank you for your review. We are glad that you enjoyed our location and cozy rooms.Our goal is to please and each one of our guests. We have made every attempt to preserve the design and integrity of the building architecture as it was built in 1906. The original plaster walls are still in place and have been wall-papered. We always appreciate our guest feedback, and we will strive to improve.It will be a pleasure for us to welcome you back at our San Remo Hotel.
0	Worst night ever. Wedding party outside in pool area until 4:30 in morning. Very loud. Front desk was ignorant to whole event even tho you could see outside tables from lobby. Room was below average with door that seemed broken and toilet rocked on floor. Worst night at a hotel in 30 years. Unconcerned personnel with indifferent attitude was the worst. Never stay... More
1	Best hotel and even better staff!!!. I got married here in May and it was the best experience of my life. The manager Mrs. Monroe helped me plan everything. She did all the leg work, provided me with contacts for music, hair, minister, everything. Since this was a destination wedding that was incredible. She is my fairy Godmother and provided my husband with wonderful wisdom. The staff helped with everything from unloading the car to decorating to rubbing my feet!!! They even danced with us in our second line parade. I highly recommend this hotel, I will never stay anywhere else in New Orleans ever again. They really treat you like family here!!!We are thrilled you had such a fantastic wedding experience and stay with us! We certainly loved having you!! We hope to see you again soon and congratulations!!
1	Great Customer Service. We stay frequently for our daughter who is at SDSU. It is our go to place for location, value and customer service. Parking can be tricky when they are booked up solid but so far we have not had major issue. We always book the King Jr Suite and find that it more than meets our needs. The cost value makes it possible for us to come and stay more often.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for your five star review! We are delighted to hear we continue to be your go to place during your visits to San Diego!We concur with the accurate description you have given about our Inn! We believe our AAA 2-diamond hotel is well located, friendly and very clean. As you mentioned parking can be a bit tricky at night, due to it being one of our many free amenities we offer it tends to get full quickly. I'm glad the King Jr Suite suites your family perfectly, on your next trip you can check out some of the other room types we have available. Again, thank you for taking the time to review us. We hope to serve you again soon!* Book Direct with Us - For the Best Service, Selection, and Value! *Yours in Hospitality,Gilda Prado Front Office ManagerBest Western Lamplighter Inn Suites at SDSUVisit our Hotel Website or Call Us at (800) 545-0778
0	Not so good. Very disappointed in cleanliness of the room and daily cleaning. Greeted by indifferent desk clerks...not close to good restaurants. The renovation which has apparently been going on for a long time meant there was clutter in the entrance and hallways.
0	Disappointing experience. My husband and I stayed for 4 nights with my 13 month old son and our experience was disappointing from the moment we checked in. When we made our reservation on the phone, we requested a crib for my son and were told it would be no problem. When we arrived we were shocked to see a pack-n-play rather than a crib and they didn't even provide us with a sheet. We called the front desk and demanded a crib. After a few hours, a crib was brought to our room... without even a crib sheet. After many phone calls to the front desk asking for a crib sheet we received a full size sheet for a crib. Apparently not a single person who worked there even knows what a crib sheet is. In addition to the crib and sheet fiasco, the carpeting in our suite was buckling and we almost tripped over it several times. There were also some sink holes in the bedroom. It seems that the hotel is about to undergo a much needed renovation, so hopefully they can also improve their customer service. The location of the hotel was the main reason we chose it, and it does have the potential to be a lovely boutique type hotel with some updates.Thank you for your candid feedback. I'm sorry to hear we didn't meet your needs initially with the crib. We've found that most prefer a soft-side crib over the steel framed ones. Once your requests were understood, though, our desk agents promptly retrieved a crib that was to your liking. We truly do appreciate your feedback and will use to provide better experiences. Thank you. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
1	Top to bottom renovation.. Fine location, next door to Corner Bakery, one mile to Lenox Mall, which was an easy walk. Rooms quite small, but comfortable. Standard free breakfast. Weekend stay, very quiet. Two caveats: No micro in room. No safe in room. Courteous staff.Thank you for reviewing our hotel! Our close proximity to the premiere shopping and dining venues in Buckhead make us a favorite of travelers visiting the Atlanta area. We try our best to make sure that our guests are comfortable and that our guest rooms are clean, comfortable and offer all of the conveniences of home. We will have microwaves in all of our guest rooms when our full renovation is complete. Until then, to ensure that our guests have everything they need, we have a microwave available 24 hours in our cozy breakfast room. Thank you for staying with us! I hope that you will visit us again when you come back to Buckhead!
1	Clean modern and good location. Nice spacious and modern room. Two large double beds.There was a nice gym that i used everyday which had just enough equipment to keep my happy.Walking distance to union square and most places aren't too much in a cab.Nice coffee in the room and in the morning downstairs.I would recommended this hotel. Dear Blackrose31,Thank you for an outstanding review! We are elated to hear how much you enjoyed your stay. We sincerely appreciate the time you took to provide your comments and feedback. We are pleased that you enjoyed our gym, the complimentary coffee in the morning and great location! We hope that you'll join us again soon, and we look forward to your return!See you soon,Jaime GonzalezFront Office ManagerHotel Vertigo
1	Hotel for 4 nights. This was a beautiful boutique hotel with lovely rooms. We had a fabulous stay. it was positioned well for Bourbon Street, Frenchmen Street, French Market, The Paddle steamer and the Trolley. All around a lovely place to stay. The staff were lovely. Breakfast was ok. You need to get there early as once they run out of things they don't seem to have any more eg certain cereals, muffins, pastries etc. It was however a lovely place to stay.We are so pleased to hear you've enjoyed your stay with us! Thank you so much for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor we greatly appreciate your feedback. Please do come see us again soon!
1	Wonderful hotel great staff. An overall excellent experience. The hotel staff was consistently friendly. Well situated to the French Quarter, Riverwalk, Harrah's and much more. The complimentary breakfast had a lot to offer - fresh fruit, waffles, scrambled eggs, sausage patties, yogurt were only some of the items available. There's also a complimentary happy hour with food, but we were out about. The rooms were nice - the beds suited us, there was a small refrig the shower was OK. An appreciated detail was that there are an abundant number of outlets throughout the room. If driving, it's not too far off the I-10 hotel parking is valet only.
0	DON'T STAY HERE!!  You have been advised.. Worst hotel experience I have ever had. While waiting to check in, I overheard the 2 gentleman in front of me, basically planning their party in the room they were getting and the reception told them where the liquor store was. The reception clerk was nice, and checked us in quickly. That was the best thing about this experience. My wife and I walked into the room and we're immediately hit with a terrible smell, and before we could complain the phone rang in the room, which was the reception desk calling to tell us that she should not have put us in that room because of the smell, and to come to the desk for new keys to a different room, which we obliged. We got our new keys and went to the new room, which smelled better, but looked sketchy, so we pulled back the covers on the bed to see ants crawling around. This was the moment we decided to check out and went right across the street to the Hampton Inn, which was great and highly recommended. We never stayed at this hotel and never will. All I needed was a clean bed to stay in for a few hours so I could catch a flight, but this hotel couldn't even provide that. In fact this hotel just seemed like a party spot for locals and would not feel comfortable even parking my car in the parking lot. It's really a shame that this hotel is like this. It's in a great location and could be nice. Shame on me, as I did not heed the warning signs from the other reviews. Thought it would be okay for a few hours sleep. I was wrong
0	Needs Improvement. Better maid service
0	i would not stay again here. i sat on the bed with my feet on the floor. kicked an empty pop bottle out from under the bed. the towel bar was loose and kept falling on the floor, there was no holder on the toilet paper holder to hold the roll on. there were kids books in the drawer.(probably from the people who own and run... More
0	Dirty rude service. Let me begin by accentuating the positive, check in staff and shuttle drivers are friendly and efficient. Room is dated but not dirty. Air didn't work properly. Lunch buffet although tasty is no where worth 22.00 for 2 meats , 2 vegetables and salad.pool and hot tub were gross. A dirty film covered the water. Hair was everywhere. Very dirty. Wait staff at the bar are rude . They act like you are bothering them to ask for service. This hotel is no where worth the they charge. Also watch your bill. They tried to charge me for items that I didn't buy. The Marriott just across the street is a much better option.On behalf of the entire hotel staff we appreciate you taking the time to write a review, Thank you for the nice comments on our staff. Our lunch prices are comparable to the other full service hotels in the market, We will have our engineers check the filtering system at the pool to see if there is an issue. We will address your comments about the service at the bar with the Food and Beverage Director.
1	Great location. This location is a mile from the airport. However it was very quiet,and we could walk to the restaurant next door. Well staffed with helpful and friendly staff, and very clean. Good amenities including towel bin at outdoor pool. Will stay there again.Please accept my appreciation for your wonderful feedback regarding your stay at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport. We are so pleased to read that you loved our convenient location, friendly associates and our well-kept amenities. It was great to have you here, and we look forward to your next stay with us soon.Sincerely,Michael GoldwasserGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport
0	Final Four 2013. There is nothing Quality about Quality Suites. The room was on the third floor and there is no elevator. The parking lot did not have enough spaces. I complained three times about the lack of hot water, cool shower is not what I expected. Carpet should be replaced, it is beyond cleaning. Hotel is a dump! Will never stay in another one. Staybridge suites across street is far superior!JohnThank you for your feedback. We apologize that your recent stay did not meet expectations and certainly take your comments very seriously as we continually strive to improve. We will soon be making property enhancements, including the addition of elevators, and hope you will give us another chance in the future.
1	Great location. Hotel is good for a very short stay. I had a partial view of the beach which was good. I was 1/2 block from the beach. I was 1 block from the main st Mission ave and several blocks from the main drag where all the shops and restaurants are. Found a cute coffee shop as I needed a real meal with fruit which was not available at the hotel. This cute shop in a house is called Cafe 976 and has Gluten free items. It is on 976 Felspar st. Cross mission 1 block to Felspar and then turn right, then walk about 5 blocks. You can't miss it. I wish my room had a table. It had a huge lounge chair too big. There was also some water leakage from the shower which had damage the lower door area. I thought i saw traces of mold but I tried not to think about that. I made a note of it when I checked out. The bed was very comfortable. The TV worked ad the workers pleasant and helpful. They might add fruit to their breakfast bar, after all its Califormia!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1	SD Ho'olaule'a. Nice and clean hotel, price very good, staff very friendly and helpful. Would like more stores closer to hotel, very close to beaches and point of interest places around. Need more parking, Had a problem hooking up to the internet but all in all the stay was good and would stay there again. Would recommend others to stay there too.Hello,Thank you for completing the survey regarding your recent stay with us here at the Best Western Mission Bay.Your business is very important to us and we value your feedback.

0	Run from this hotel till it was not 100 renovated and refurbished. The building is well located next to Union Square in San Francisco, 2 steps from Cable Car station. a Theatre occupies the first floors of the building.At the reception the staff is very standard, nothing more.Room I was given (and I was upgraded on last floor) is so old that no other word come to my mind than dirty. No Air conditioner, a fan is at your disposal on the ceiling, above the bed, and you can open the window.Bathroom is small, and especially needs to be renovated.For the same price you can leave in a much better Hotel in San Francisco.Dear Matthieu L,Thank you very much for taking your time to share your comment with us on TripAdvisor. I am so sorry to hear our hotel didn't meet your expectation. Our hotel offers different style of rooms and I wish we could offer you a different room if we have known this during your stay with us. Our hotel just recently updated all the guest rooms furniture such headboard, dressers, night stands and mini fridges. All the guest's floor hallway carpets are renewed and as well as lobby furniture. We are going to renew the guest's room carpet very soon, and also working on minor renovation in each guest's room. I hope you would give us a second chance for your next visit in San Francisco. Thank you again for staying with us.
1	Better Than An Ordinary Room!. We loved our room at Wyndham Canterbury! It included a small kitchenette with a dining table, a sitting area, and a separate bedroom. While there were only two of us, we certainly enjoyed the extra space. This would be a great place for a small family! And it's only a couple blocks to Union Square.Good Morning JudyZ24,We appreciate the time to comment on your stay with us. I was happy to read that you enjoyed your room and the amenities that we provided during your stay. We hope that you will come back to stay with us again soon.Regards,Matthew JonesGeneral ManagerWyndham Canterbury at San Francisco
0	Very Disappointed. We were staying here for a seminar. I contacted the hotel and left messages for a return phone call for the seminar rate. I had to push to get a return call. Spoke with the sales manager and requested a room with a king bed. Upon arrival, they had booked us in a queen bed room. Staff was not friendly and we were told they were totally booked so were were stuck with the queen room. The hotel was noisy during the day due to construction and public bathrooms were out of order. I had asked for a bottle of water at the desk and you have thought I asked for the world. Not impressed at all.We're sorry we didn't provide the high quality of services you deserve. This is not typical of our hotel and staff, and we have addressed the issues you mentioned with the appropriate team members. We try to make each guest experience a great one at our hotel and your satisfaction is important to us. Thank you for your feedback and we hope you will give us another opportunity soon to make your stay the best it can be.
1	not bad. The hotel itself is lovely and the staff were very kind and helpful. Just a couple of downsides the shower gel was low throughout our stay and you could get hardly any out i was a bit surprised this wasn't checked during housekeeping. The shower itself also wasn't very powerful. We had a clock in the room but it wasn't showing the right time and appeared to be out of battery didnt think this looled very good. The air conditioning was quite noisy but you could get a good temperature. We enjoyed our stay though as i said just a few minor things.
0	SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN. This place should be closed. It is dirty and un-safe. Upon check-in, the woman at the desk said she required credit card or cash payment up front (should of been our first clue this place a disaster) She would not hold payment until our check-out like other hotels. When we got to our room, what we found was outrageous. The... More

1	Reynaldo the van driver is great!!. I was placed in this hotel by the agency that hired me because the Hilton Anatole had no more govt rate rooms available. Now I am glad that they did . Its smaller and more managable than the Annatole which is HUGE. Room was pretty standard but did have microwave, refrigerator and coffee pot standard. Bathroom was on the large size. Cleanliness was not the best, but certainly not the worst. No Bed Bugs. Hotel business center is free! Yeah HGI. Also there is high speed internet in all the rooms. And you can send printing to the business center from your room. Highlight for me was the van service, especially when Reynaldo was driving. Because I am short and have a prosthetic leg I needed a stool to get into the very high 15 passenger van. He found one and every time he picked me up or took me across to the Annatole he had to run around and find it again. THEY SHOULD HAVE ONE PERMANENTLY IN THE VAN. My room was not ready when I arrived at 3:30 PM. The desk clerk offered me a snack from the little store. Or to have the van take me to a restaurant. She recommended several restaurants we settled on one. When Reynaldo and I were talking enroute, and he learned it was my first trip to Texas, he asked if I liked BBQ. He then took me into downtown Dallas to Sonny Bryans. It was great! The highlight of my whole trip as I never had another chance for a real meal again. On the way back to HGI, Reynaldo when he picked me up drove past the Book Depository Museum and pointed out Dealy Plaza and the grassy knoll. I never would have seen either were it not for him. Other employees were adequate in the restaurant etc. Other van drivers not so good--no stool etc. Desk employees were pretty efficient and well informed. The restaurant in the hotel in only open for breakfast and dinner. Breakfast is full (eggs, bacon and sausage, pancakes, omlets cooked to order) or continental. There is a pretty complete buffet with hot and cold cereal, muffins, bagels, toast, fresh fruit, yoghurt, etc. Its pricey at 12 but free to government employees. Dinner menu is limited and there is a nightly special. Not on the menu, but available is a soup and salad combo for dinner at 7.95. It was exactly what I wanted. Room service is available.Dear Valued Guest:I want to thank you for your comments and feedback as this allows us to improve our products and servcies for you and all future guests of ours. I appreciate your business and loyalty to Hilton Hotels and truly value your feedback. We have purchased 2 new stools for the van so that we are proactive and have them available at all times. Thank you for recognizing our van driver for his services provided and he will be rewarded for his exceptional service. If there is anything I can do for you in the future, please let me know at anytime. Thank you again and have a wonderful holiday.Best Regards,Blake DoranGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Dallas Market Center
1	Great, quirky, chintzy place!. We loved this hotel. It's chintzy splendour harked back to another era. Those who love cool and modern will find it not to their taste but we found it charming. The lobby's clearly had a bit of a tart up in recent years which is a shame as it's black and purple theme is more Prince than Chintz and out of keeping with the rest of the hotel's faded splendour. Put it back to how it was please NHH! There's a sweet little Italian bistro attached to it which seemed to be quite busy. The rooms were very clean and very comfortable. Reception staff were all really lovely and helpful. We'll definitely stay here again when in SF. The location too was ideal - a few blocks from Union Square - very central.
1	Super relaxing stay on beautiful grounds. We only found this hotel halfway through our stay in La Jolla, and we wish we had found it sooner! A friend and I brought our teenage daughters to La Jolla in search of beach and pool time. The Estancia met all of our expectations. The grounds of the hotel are beautiful, clean and well-kept, with a sparkling pool and a relaxing whirlpool. The rooms are pretty too, with newer tile baths and even a complimentary bottle of wine! The resort was so quiet and peaceful, it felt like we had stumbled upon a well-kept secret. The hotel is situated about a 5-10 minute drive from Torry Pines State Preserve, where there is a nice broad beach for swimming and exploring. You can also take a two mile walk to Black Beach, where the surf conditions are epic. I would say the one element of our stay that was less than excellent could be the food. The poolside lunch was pretty average. But our dinner at Mustangs Burros was tastier. We much preferred this location to the hotels right in the village of La Jolla. Estancia felt more like a real getaway. We are already planning our next visit there!Thank you for taking the time to share detailed thoughts from your stay in June 2013. Your 5-star review is much appreciated! We are pleased that you not only enjoyed your overall stay at Estancia La Jolla, but also you got a chance to experience the Torrey Pines Golf Course. Again, thank you for your review. Please come back and visit us again soon!
1	Huge, clean room!. Stayed here for 4 nights. Price was on the lower end of choices on Key West so we were prepared for some short comings. We were very surprised at the cleanliness of the grounds and size if the room given the price bracket. We had room 146, which put us on the inside, bottom floor. Very comfy king size bed, small fridge, dresser, and desk didn't come close to filling up the room. I paced it off to about 20x16! The bathroom was also spacious. No tub but a glass enclosed shower the size of a tub with plenty of pressure and hot water. The included breakfast was what I'd call a Continental Plus, as it also had scrambled eggs, sausages, and DIY fresh made waffles. Heated pool and pool bar too! Would definitely stay here again and highly recommended! Thank you for your comments. So glad you enjoyed our spacious clean rooms. Thank you for staying with us and recommending us to all of your friends.
1	Awesome modern Boutique Hotel Vagabond in Miami. Beautiful new boutique hotel with spacious, clean and fun rooms, decorated in Art Deco style and lots of room! All the rooms are located around a nice swimming pool with outside bar that have a dj or band at night. We were there during Halloween and the vibe was really good, locals came out to the bar to have a cocktail at the pool and enjoy the music. They also have a very good restaurant with small fusion-like bites, very cool! De staff was very friendly and lovely cute breakfast buffet where you an sit in peace watching the morning news. When in Mimi will definitely return to the Vagebond!Thank you for staying with us and we look forward to your return visit. Glad you enjoyed the entertainment by the pool. We do have DJs Friday and Saturday nights from 8 to midnight.
0	Not Impressed. The location is nice as well as the hotel staff, but is not a good place to stay if you need to get any sleep at night. I stayed there twice and both times I had to call down to the front desk and have security come up and investigate noise issues. Guests seemed to congregate in the hallways creating lots of noise into the wee hours of the mornings.
0	The freshener of the room was too strong it smelled like a men cologne. The freshener of the room was too strong it smelled like a men cologne. Bathroom smelled like pee. Also when I was trying to check in the staff (2 of them ) were just talking to each other I had to wait a cool 3 mins to get help. Thank you for the feedback, we are extremely sorry to hear your stay was less than excellent. I can assure you this is not the experience we strive for and will review these comments with our team to help us improve moving forward. We hope to have the chance to impress you on a future stay.
0	Must be better options around. Booked for overnight stay prior to cruise. Arrived at hotel around 2PM amid lots of ongoing confusion with other guests in the lobby. When our turn came we were told our room was not ready with no real specifics as to when it would be. Was told we could go around to shopping areas while waiting. Decided to wait in... More
0	Run Down but Cheap. This property was probably very nice in the 60's. It doesn't look like its been updated or cared for much since. Toilet tank dripped so they put a trash can under it to catch the water. AC never got room below 76 degrees. Curtains were falling off the wall. Old style TV. Screen door had no spring so it blew...

1	Perfect. This Marriott is right across the street from Rush Medical Center, which is where I had scheduled knee replacement surgery. Many out of towners like myself, who are having surgery stay here, including the rich and famous. I had expected convenience but there was so much more. First, the food is remarkably good and the service was good as well. But what sets this place apart is the staff they are incredibly helpful to and supportive of the patients are are there for anything you need. So if you are coming to Chicago for surgery or other medical care, stay here!Thank you so much for your feedback! We are glad you enjoyed your stay and the food in our dining outlet. Our staff looks forward to accommodating you in the future.
0	Not even a chance to check in. The parking lot was covered in trash, which would turn out to be the cleanest part of the hotel. The lobby was filthy. There was a half eaten meal on one of the coffee tables and dust everywhere. The receptionist was on her personal phone, discussing her plans for the weekend. She held up a finger, turned her back to... More
0	Be forewarned, ceilings are thin... you WILL hear neighbors. While the hotel is clean and in an excellent location, you will NOT get a good night's sleep here if you have neighbors above you who need to fulfill their 10,000 daily steps in the middle of the night. Of the four nights we stayed here all four nights were full of different neighbors above us who for some reason need to walk back and forth around their room ALL NIGHT LONG, banging cabinets, doors, etc. Complaints to the house host were not helpful at all. We never got a decent night sleep here. Also, don't believe the shuttle stuff. We tried every day to get one, first being told just call 10 mins before you need one, then told you must come downstairs in person and wait, and oh by the way it would be a 40 min wait (when the shuttle only goes a 1 mile radius I do not understand). Never was able to get a shuttle the entire time we were there. The staff at the morning buffet were wonderful, friendly, but the hot food was not hot, the selection was small. And lastly, take the stairs. The elevator is S-L-O-W. We often waited more than 5 minutes. I would not stay here again, mostly because of the noise factor.Hello, Julie!Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us. We are sorry to hear that you did not get a good nights sleep - that's the exact opposite of what we are shooting for! Noise complaints are relatively uncommon for us, and we will investigate a bit to see if anything can be done about the particular room you stayed in. I am sorry too to hear of your experience with the shuttle. I know it seems crazy, but with traffic sometimes a shuttle run for several passengers within a mile can take much longer than expected. It sounds like we could have done a much better job communicating with you though. We appreciate the feedback and will certainly use it as a training opportunity internally. Thank you again and we hope to have the chance to serve you again - with a good nights sleep!
0	I liked the beds but the smell of the hall ways were of arm pits. I had the suite on the 2nd floor. Every time some one walked on the third floor suite the entire room sounded like a stampede. My girls cried until the people went to sleep. The floor boards need to be redone. The staff were top class and very accommodating for us. I would stay there again but I would need to make sure I bring fabreeze and even more disinfectant spray.Please fix the leak in the ice room.My daughter liked the flower pictures on the guestroom walls.Dear 746tabithal,Thank you for your kind words regarding your stay at the Hawthorn Suites Dallas Park Central. We were glad to have you as our guest, and appreciate you taking the time to comment regarding your visit with us. We have gone over your review, and have address the issues you expressed concern with in the halls, and ordering new Ice Machines. As a hotel that was built in 1997, we are looking into ways we can minimize or soften any noise between floors, and are addressing with the hotel's ownership. We look forward to the opportunity to host you again the next time you are in the Dallas area. Thanks again for being our guest! Best regards, Charlie Westhoven Operations Manager Hawthorn Suites Dallas Park Central
1	Cute, quirky, and comfortable. I stayed at this hotel while in town for a conference. The main conference hotel was fully booked so I used Trip Advisor to look for an alternative, and found the Horton Grand. I wanted something interesting and authentic rather than international-hotel-chain-plastic, and the Horton Grand really delivered. Yes, it's shabby in places and some of the wooden furniture and fitments are chipped and knocked about, but that really didn't matter. Staying here was lovely. With the benefit of reviews from previous guests on TA I asked for and was given a room at the back of the hotel. People coming out of the nightclub opposite still got a bit noisy on a couple of nights (I was there over the Memorial Day weekend) but I'm a light sleeper and it didn't disturb me over-much. There was worse noise from the room upstairs: the floors (although carpeted) are wooden, and there must have been a family of elephants staying up there! It still wasn't enough to put me off though. If you want a quiet hotel, don't stay in the middle of the entertainment quarter!Service was good, my room was clean, and breakfasts were fine.If you want an experience that's a little different from the McDonald's type of hotel, this one is for you :-)
1	Just what we wanted!. From the minute the car pulled up outside, I felt we were in for a treat. It is not a place for minimalist loving, clean lines types but if you want old world grandeur a cosy, shut out the world, maybe even a club feel then this is the spot. Great staff, good food, very comfortable ensuite bedroom. It was tempting not to leave the hotel at all (we did!) due to the heavy rain just curl up on the sofa in the Fireside Room with a book (we did that too!) A very contented few days!Thank you so much for you comments, Mayloughlin! We're so glad you appreciated our quirky coziness and our staff! We hope to welcome you back again soon.
0	Big disappointment...Hotel was great, but staff just missed it big time!. Kimpton Hotels are an amazing brand if you never have tried them I would recommend it!Hipster hotels, free wine/beer hour, great style and good experience most of the time...With that said we booked months in advance and worked with NickHotel Solamar on this being a special birthday weekend and we wanted a room with a view of the ball park as we where coming in to scout the hotel for a major event happening in Feb 2015 Petco Stadium.This was Labor Day weekend but we checked in on Sunday mid day and it was train wreckLine of people 20 deep waiting outside for valet, so it kept people from being able to get in, no bell staff helping new people coming in only people leavingWe stood there 15+ min before I had to yell to get a bell men to help No staff to open big massive doors and we had to drag in our own luggage By the time we get to front desk the agent seemed a little put off with helping out and told us our room would not be ready for a few hours then points back out side to stand in line to get luggage stored Seriously You would think in a big weekend you would have managers or assistant manager downstairs directing the chaos but didn't see anyone of authority Its now 5p and we get a call our room is finally ready so we come back in to the same person and she is still in a put off mood and never tells us about the pool, free bicycles to use, the wine/beer happy hour etcIts interesting that some younger people in the hospitality industry forget how big a part they can play in a customer experience after all most of us our on pleasure vacations at the time we come and interact.The hotel itself in beautiful deep wood tones, velvet, lot of room and open space which for downtown San Diego is rare! The room itself was very big (King special) very nice open with big windows that...wait for it...Over looked a massive construction site the website doesnt warn you about nore did the front desk etcSo be warned its a high rise coming so this build may take years do not get a room on the north. The pool was nice but not a lot of shade and it was hot that day. Great Happy Hour on Sunday/Monday holiday.Staff was hit and miss some could care less when you came and went and no interaction. Bell men never greeted or open the doors which when you have packages from shopping, a dog etc...its simply courtesy! Crystal the from desk was so nice stopping us asking how are day was, where had we gone, and always had a treat for our dog!There is a lot of places to eat in the area, lot to do, light rail is right down the street, Petco Stadium is a block away, convention center 2 blk away, Horton plaza a 20 min walk.Would we stat again..I dont think so, with Hard Rock, Omni, Hilton Bayside, even the Hyatt Grand at the other end of downtown there is just to many options for other hotel when you have bad service that didn't live up to the Kimpton Experience.Side note the management comp the room etc after that fact which was thoughtful but hoping a major retraining on hospitality going forward.Dear RollPositive Thank you for your feedback from your visit over Labor Day weekend. As previously mentioned in our prior correspondence, we agree, it was a busy weekend and we could have certainly done a better job to be prepared. We are happy to share that we have addressed this opportunity with our leaders and are better prepped for the future. Thank you again for your feedback.Terry BuchholzGeneral Manager
1	Great Visit to Seattle at the W. Love the W Seattle, it is close to everything in downtown and the service at the hotel is great. We had a nice time in the bar/restaurant as well. It is a great area to hang out and relax as well as talk to friends. The bed was very comfortable and the room quiet and clean.Hello ggpmb, many thanks for your fabulous review of your recent stay at W Seattle. We are thrilled that you had a great time and enjoyed the hotel so much! Our team works hard to make sure that our guests have a great experience, and it sounds like you did! We hope to welcome you back next time you are in the city. Thanks again!
0	Clean but old. The room was very clean but the property is old. The bathroom ceiling looked moldy. It did not smell bad.
0	Over 30? Stay away!. Two positives: the front desk staff and the lobby. ALL downhill from there. Reservations did not confirm booking with Hotels.com so I had to wait at the front desk for 45 minutes while they sorted that out--the staff who helped me were very apologetic and helpful, however. The room and the annex in general is one of the worst places I've ever stayed. From the stench of the hallway to the dilapidated condition of the room, the free WiFi with no connection, and the balcony with its rickety railing and beautiful view of the parking garage and liquor store next door, permeated by the sounds of drunken kids in the hallways all night long and the cacophony of constant EMS and police sirens that never seemed to stop. If you're over 30, you DO NOT want to stay here. EVER. I will never stay here again--for the same money you can stay at the EconoLodge next door--certainly no better, but how could it be worse
0	Nothing went well. Power went out at only this property for several hours. Staff was not equipped to deal with it. Breakfast in the morning the worst ever at a Hampton Inn. Total cut corners property. Will not stay again
0	Could not enjoy ameneties. The pool and hot tub was filthy. Tried to call front desk and was unable to reach anyone about it.I apologize your stay with us was not a pleasant one. I have shared your comments with the entire staff so we can address concerns such as yours to make sure we do a better job in delivering a great experience.
1	extremely pleased. My husband and I stayed 5 nights and were extremely pleased with all aspects of our stay. I had been a little apprehensive prior to arrival because the price was so good, I feared that the room might not be as nice as we wanted. However, we were thrilled with the appearance, cleanliness, service, and friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. We would definitely choose this hotel again.Thank you for your kind review and I am glad to hear how much you enjoyed your stay. The Hawthorn Suites Dallas Park Central is perfect for long stays and I hope you will visit us again the next time you are in Dallas.
0	No parking spot as a guest. I asked for my parking spot as a guest and they respond they were full and send me across the street to park my car to Komo plaza and pay 60 usd by my own for 2 nights. At least I was expected any courtesy or a refund of 60 usd from the hotel.Too bad.
0	WORST HOTEL EVER. we booked this hotel and they told us we could cancel our reservation 24 hours before the stay.i read the reviews and saw the hotel was bad. So i canceled. They said there was no cancelation policy. So I canceled my credit card. But then I found out that the charge went through.
0	Close to CTA train and airport. Stayed 2 nights for a conference. This hotel is very close to the airport. I used Lyft to get there and it took 9 minutes in morning traffic. The CTA blue line Cumberland stop is literally in their parking lot and I used it to get back to the airport. I also took it downtown to sightsee one night- was about a 35 minute ride to be dropped off right in the heart of the city by the riverwalk and magnificent mile. I was able to check in using the app at 9:00 and by lunchtime I had a room key and could grab a quick nap. Using the app I requested a shaving kit (an option listed as available) and a refrigerator which the website lists as available upon request. I received a chat message that a fridge was on the way up to the room and would be placed in the room. I left to sightsee and returned 7 hours later with a bottle of wine and left overs expecting to have somewhere appropriate to store them. There was no fridge or shaving kit in the room. I wouldn't mind but when they offer to provide me with anything I forgot (how do you fly with a razor nowadays anyhow) and tell me that something is on its way, then I expect it to be there. If they had replied that either were unavailable it wouldn't have been a big deal. Conference services were okay. Meeting rooms were comfortable temperatures. Food wasn't great but I passed other meetings with amazing looking food so I feel like my organization just picked the cheapest option. The grilled vegetable sandwich boxed lunch I was provided was quite good. No where around in walking distance for toiletries or food. Grub Hub was limited to a Denny's, several Mexican restaurants and a subway. Pretty much forced to travel to eat or eat at the hotel restaurant which is okay but nothing spectacular. I wouldn't probably stay here unless it was required for a conference or the location being by public transportation. Thank you for your review. As we pride ourselves on delivering a memorable hotel experience during your travels, we have unfortunately fallen short of our goal during your recent stay. We apologize for the shaving kit and refrigerator issue you experienced. It has been addressed with our housekeeping team. Thank you for staying with us, and we hope to see you the next time you're in Chicago.
1	efficient digs in middle of downtown ATL. Having tried to book a room at the W hotel in midtown only to find that it would run close to 500/might, we reserved at the Aloft which sits right next to the site of the new Georgia Dome. The Aloft is very similar to the W, but without some of the frills, which is fine when you save over 200. The rooms were quiet and self parking behind the hotel is secured and only 25, unlike some exorbitant valet fees you can be charged in the ATL. The rooms have complimentary coffee machines included as well as the Bliss bathroom amenities you find in the W. breakfast is self-serve, a-la-carte and offers hot prepared to order sandwiches for 6 - a nice break from the one-price buffet option that many lower cost hotels offer. I hope SPG continues to build these properties as we will seek them out in the future.
1	Wonderful trip. Very helpful staff members. Everyone was nice and courteous. The rooms are much bigger than the other reviews state. You can hear the ocean waves at night. There is beach equipment such as surf-boards, beach umbrellas, beach chairs, and bikes that are free to use which will save you money. Thanks for staying with us! We're thrilled to hear that our hospitality was well received, we work hard to provide our guests a welcoming environment. Next time your ready for a bike ride on the Pacific Beach boardwalk, give us a ring and we're happy to extend you a special rate for returning guests. Thanks again for staying at Pacific View Inn
0	Expected so much more. I requested a non smoking room. When I opened my door I could smell heavy scent is stale cigarettes and alcohol. Every thing in the room seemed dingy. So much so I had to go to the local grocery store and buy sanitation wipes.and come back clean my room. The AC did not work well at all. The next morning I go down to the breakfast and there is the front desk in the dining area yelling at a couple because they were eating there. And then he goes and gets another female employee and she goes over and starts yelling at them. Granted the couple were not guests of the hotel. But everyone knows you should put on a professional face at all times. The could have asked them quietly to follow them out. Then after work I returned to my room to find that the maids and come in but didn't even replace the towels. This is the worst experience at a hotel I have ever had. I will not be returning, and I do travel to DC about every other month for business. And this hotel will permanently be marked off my list. Needs a total face lift and brand new well trained staff. I would wipe it clean and start with a brand new clean slate... With everything.
1	Friendly. Older hotel. Always clean. Staff is always pleasant. Todd at the front desk must have a stash of happy pills. They will eventually loose Brenda at a high pay waitress job, as she can do it. She and Greychen. do a great job with breakfast. Always clean. Always friendly Thank you for taking the time to leave us your feedback. I'm glad that our staff was able to enhance your stay with us and I will make sure that Todd, Brenda, and Gretchen are all aware of your review and are acknowledged at our next meeting. We hope that you will stay will us again soon.
1	Wonderful final room, but check-in service was lacking. We were charged for the first night of stay even though we were not in SF yet due to a sudden death in the family. In addition, the room we were given the next day was one of the smallest I've ever had, even though we had requested ahead of time to an upgrade. Told we didn't get the upgrade because we weren't there to check in. Throughout our four-night stay, one elevator was out of service and the other was very slow. We resorted to using the stairs to our third floor room. At checkout, we waited almost 15 minutes for an elevator because our luggage was too heavy to carry down the stairs. HOWEVER, for our final three nights we were upgraded to an Oasis Suite for no additional charge (beyond the night we were charged and didn't use). Very quiet, spacious room facing courtyard. Location is great for all SF tourist activities and shopping. Ate one night in the Italian restaurant. It was decent and the service was good. If check-in and the first night had been better, I'd give it a 5, but the poor first impression dropped the overall score. Hope both elevators are now functioning!
1	Great place to stay!. Great value for a great location! Rooms are big and spacious, bathroom is a great size. All rooms come with free wifi which is fantastic, and there is free parking (which we didn't need). If you don't have a car you can catch a bus right at the front or you can walk the short walk to Fisherman's Wharf. Additionally if you want to ride a bike around the city there is a place next door that rents them. The staff are quite friendly and helpful for when asking questions about the city.If we do go back to San Francisco in the future we will return! Thanks for the great stay!!
1	Nice Spot In the Heart of Philly. The staff and hotel were very nice. The rooms were modern and obviously recently redone (at least our 13th floor room was.) The building itself is old, but it looks good inside. The lobby and bar are clean and modern. There is a pool table and lots of games to entertain kids and the young at heart in the lobby area.Downtown Philly is heavily populated with the homeless. The Methodist Church across Arch St from the Aloft Downtown seems like a focal point for them. Several times I was approached for a handout, but never felt like my wife, son and I were in any danger. I wouldn't necessarily recommend walking alone after dark in the area, but it is a bustling area during the day. We walked back as a group to the hotel from City Hall subway station after a Phillies game (maybe 11:30pm) and it was fine.It is very easy to get to a bus or subway train in a 5-10 minute walk. The views of City Hall are stunning and Love Park, the Reading Terminal Market, even Independence Hall and the Museum of Art are all walkable. The Convention Center is right next to the Aloft, so it would be a good place to stay if you were attending a conference there.There were always Uber and Lyft drivers a minute or 2 away when we needed to get anywhere. There are also cabs and the hotel offers Valet parking for 50 or so a night. There are also several parking ramps and some street parking in the area as well.There is a McDonalds across the street, but no restaurant in the building. There is a small store for food and drinks inside the lobby and a 7-11 convenience store a block away down the street on Broad St. Otherwise, I didn't find a ton of food options immediately around the hotel, but there are a lot of options a couple blocks away.It is certainly not cheap, but I liked the hotel and I would stay there again the next time I go back to Philadelphia.Hi JW, Thank you for the FIVE BUBBLE review! We get excited when our guests connect with our hotel and city as you did. Your last line I would stay there again is what we all work hard to accomplish. We also appreciate your taking the time to provide other travelers your experience outside the hotel. Our pride extends beyond our hotel and into our community. It's great that you're sharing personal and authentic stories, thank you for that. I hope all your travels bring you much joy!Evan
0	Wyndham doesn't care about needs of guests. MoreMore
1	Great location off strip. This place is an average hotel. No casino, no room service, no glitz or glam. BUT it has clean rooms, clean pool w/free cabanas, a small nice restaurant, and nice staff. Location is next the Wynn and Encore close by Circus Circus. Across the street from a 24hr Walgreens and Dennys. I wouldnt call it a family place but its not bad for families. Some young and old partiers but not overly loud or obnoxious. If youre looking to go and dont need the pricey amenities then this place is right. It could use some updating but we werent in the room staring at the walls.
0	Poor job cleaning. So I stayed here for one night in room 114 (their only king 1 bedroom suit) and it was ok but looked like they just gave it a quick once over after the last guest stayed. Didn't think much of it as I was planning on checking out in the morning. I also noticed a small stain on one of... More
1	An Absolute Gem, Superb Staff, Bliss! Every Boutique Hotel should use this as its template. Even before I arrived at Soniat I had an insight into the warm hospitality that was the theme throughout our stay. From the warm, helpful welcome from Mark and his coleague, to the professional manner of Calvin, the housekeepers and the managers, they could not do enough. I hesistate to use the term hotel to describe Soniat, that's like calling Buckingham palace a house. The rooms are luxurious, I really want that bed in my home. Situated on a peaceful street, with a church next door, and well situated to get around the French quarter, and other attractions. Everything is quaint, peaceful, and friendly, a haven. The setting is beautiful courtyards, with water features, classical music played softly, and a well stocked honour bar, what more could you want...wait did I mention breakfast No meals are served apart from breakfast and I absolutley rate it as a five star experience, my first taste of American biscuits was fab, they have to be the best biscuits, fresh orange juice, great coffee (apologies I'm drooling just thinking about it). It was a great choice, we hope to be back and I am more than willing to recommend it to anyone looking for an oasis of calm, warm hospitality. Go, you won't regret it.Wow!You have made my day!What a kind and thoughtful review. Thank you so very much for taking the time.It would be a real pleasure to welcome you back.
0	Royal motel. It the worse motel in Baton Rouge LA.it has bedbugs don't rent from them the rooms are nasty rotten mattresses in them the owner gets rude when you tell her about it the health board should be notified cause there is black mold in rm 5 along with bedbugs
1	Great Value. We just returned from a 6-night stay at the Ocean Tower and we loved it. Great location- less than a block from the beach. We knew it was an older hotel with rooms that needeed some updating, but the rooms were fine. Very clean and with comfortable beds. Our room (906) had a terrific view of the ocean and it had a balcony with a view of Diamond Head. It was probably the best room in the hotel. The hotel staff is great! Very, very nice and helpful. The free breakfast is coffee, juice, and sweet rolls. The coffee was available starting at 6 am and the rest was available 7:30 - 9:30. Breakfast is adequate. Again, the staff are always there to help. We were given some juice at noon as we checked out.This hotel is a great value. It may not be a 4 or 5 star hotel, but it is more than acceptable and a real bargain for the money. The managment has big plans to upgrade the rooms. We were shown two rooms which have just been remodeled and they are awesome (an oriental-type design with plenty of high-end amenities). Look for the remodeling to take 12-18 months to complete. They plan to remodel 2 floors at a time. When the remodel is done, this will be an excellent hotel. As a smaller hotel with only 9 floors, it offers a more intimate atmosphere and there are no long waits for the elevators.We highly recommend this hotel!
1	Great Staff. My sister and I stayed here in between a week-long camping trip and a reservation at Gunshow. We were a little early for check in, but Emma was very kind and found us an available room. We had plenty of time to clean up and head to the restaurant, which was close enough to get to in a timely manner, even at rush hour. Beds were super cozy, breakfast was extensive and decent: waffles, biscuits and gravy, cereals, yogurt, fruit, good coffee. Candace checked us out and was genuinely concerned that we had a good stay. Like she owned the place concerned. Rare and wonderful service. Only complaint was our shower rod was a bit rusty and the hot/cold valve a bit temperamental. Would definitely stay here again.Julie R. G,Thank you for posting a review. I am glad to read that you were happy and comfortable with your stay. I do hope you are able to stay with us again. Best Regards,Enoch D.
1	While overall I was very pleased with the experience, I had higher expectations. The Scene: I stayed a few nights here for a work conference that took place within the hotel.The Experience: I ended up in a room with two beds. I thought perhaps a platinum elite member would be guaranteed a room type (I prefer King). Nope. Perhaps because I booked under a conference rate, there was no leeway. The hotel rooms were clean with a nice setup, no complaints there. Meeting rooms were great, albeit it got a little chilly sometimes. Got a drink at the bar, prices will make you wince. Be ready to pay for parking as well. I get it that nicer hotels charge more for the same experience elsewhere doesn't mean I have to like it. Service was great, one of the better experiences I've had.The Verdict: When I think of the Marriott chain, I attribute the JW Line to be the best-of-the-best aside from Ritz-Carlton. I thought I'd be able to drown myself in opulence and feel special. It was pretty, there were certainly great views, and it is in an awesome location, but I just felt underwhelmed by it all. Can't quite put my finger on it, but there were some things that were missing and a couple of missteps that soured the experience. I'd go back if I can get a great deal, otherwise, I'm willing to stay further out and deal with the drive it's just not worth it to me.
1	Hidden Gem. I love this hotel. I went for Mardi Gras. The room was very clean. The free breakfast was delicious. It is a bit of a walk from Canal but you are saving hundreds. Just make sure you watch the parade in a spot where you can freely get to Rampert and are not barricaded in on the wrong side of the street. This is a clean sufficient hotel that will allow you to have money to spend on others things. You will be just fine walking down Rampert at night. Checkin was flawless. Thanks Best Western for the very good first impression.
0	Business Trip. Very disappointed, fake advertising, not worth the money, Valet sucks, staff rarely speaks English. I wont ever be staying and recommending anyone to this property ever again that is for sure. Find alternatives.Dear celo104, We are sorry for any inconveniences you might had experienced and we are taking your case under investigation to further address the issue.
1	Hampton Inn Review Philadelphia International Airport. Now, of course this is not a huge Time Share resort or anything like that . But looking at hotels like the Comfort Inn, Best Western , Etc ... this is how i view this hotel. And it is specifically the one at the Airport in Philly. This is a great hotel easily my favorite out of them all. Whenever we go away Internationally or within the USA we always stay here. Also love the Park and fly where they watch your car while you are away. This hotel did something for us that no other hotel has ever done . When we went away to Paris many years ago while we were sleeping they sent their driver out overnight and in the morning they gave us 2 Plane pillows to have on the flight. Those are a good 20 each . Just to say have a good time. Who does that !!! As a TY we brought them back some souvenirs and try to always give them something when we come back. We also Love the breakfast. Always at least 2 hots included and there are waffles you can make . Food has never run out . Recently late late at night the coffee was a little cold. I would have dealt with it but they insisted on me having hot coffee. They tied me up and made me wait for it . It was not so bad because i also had a cookie . If you have a flight before breakfast they have bag breakfast you can take with you. Of course drink the water before you get to the airport. The Park and Fly is great nice to know your car is safe while you are away. There is a Ruby Tuesday right next door too if you want dinner. When we got there they offered a wine as an arrival treat. Also a new nice touch is they actually when they pick you up at the airport offer to take you back to the HI for a nice drink before you leave . This is new and a nice thing to do. The only things i can say that would be better is work something out with the restaurant next door where maybe we get a discount or something. HI must give them a TON of business. A lot of places we stay we get a discount at the adjoining restaurant when you show your room card. Also it was a bit confusing in the airport looking for the kiosk that has the HI number to call for pickup. They moved everything and i wandered around looking for it never found it. Luckily i saw the van outside and he waited while we got the luggage. Other then that it is our favorite hotel to stay at for the Airport Stay.Thank you for your kind words and feedback in regards to your recent stay at the Hampton Inn Philadelphia Airport. We look forward to serving you again soon if your travels should bring you back to Philadelphia.Director of Sales

The towels were ruff and smaller. Breakfast was a surprise and decent. It had hot waffles, but there was not fruit available. The street getting to this hotel had huge pot holes that could not be...

0	Avoid this under renovation overpriced place. The bathroom was disgusting it was not cleaned, hair in the bathtub, cracked base, dirt, dust. Hotel is under renovation, the smell in the hallway is horrible. The noise was unbearable. The location is good, you can use this hotel to store your luggage...: nothing elseThank you for taking the time to review us. I am very sorry your stay was less than excellent. We take cleanliness very seriously and I will report this feedback to our team to help us improve. Thanks again.

1	Great Location Great People!. First, perfect location for PETCO, Convention, and Gas Lamp!Spent 3 nights at Solamar for a convention. First upon arrival I was quickly greeted by the valet and taken care of. They offered bag service but I was okay handling my own. I checked-in quickly with Q and headed straight up to the room on the 7th floor. When I arrived at my room the door was open. It was rather strange but I made sure I knocked and called out because I didn't want to walk in on anything I didn't want to see :)The room was clean. I had a window with a view of another building. Nothing too much there. The TV was massive and to be honest was pleasant because I didn't sacrifice my NFL experience away from home. Here's where my experience got a little ruff. At 4:30 am I was woke up by a screaming child in the adjacent room. I get it, kids are kids, but this screaming was more of an attention getting scream because there was no crying, just screaming. So I tried to sleep and eventually the child stopped screaming. Then at 6:30 the kid was playing and screaming at the same time. That was it, no more sleep for the day. I got up to take a shower just to leave, and that was when I noticed the shower head was leaking from the top, mildew in the tile cracks, and heavy mildew at the drain. Blocked that out of my head and just showered up. I will say the water pressure is on point. When I returned to the room later that day I tried to just relax, and then the kid started screaming. I didn't want to judge the kid and become angry so I called the front desk. Q answered and I explained to him what was going on. He even mentioned on the phone that he could hear the kid through the phone. He quickly provided me two options, I chose one and I was set for the rest of the trip. I moved to the 8th floor, view of the pool and not a peep from anyone or anything. In summary, Q is the reason my review is 4 stars. He saved my trip and experience. I was able to sleep uninterrupted! I knocked the score one point for the cleanliness of the bathroom in 706. The 8th floor bathroom was noticeably cleaner (816). Thanks for a great experience Q and Solamar. Will consider this location as an option in the future!Thank you CAm2317 for this detailed and candid review. I couldn't be happier to see that Q saved the day on your seemingly frustrating visit. I'm very sorry for the experience you had. I have shared your feedback regarding the door having been left open and the shower issue with our Executive Housekeeper for follow up with our team. That feedback is very concerning, it has not been taken lightly and will be used as a training opportunity for our team to ensure that such an experience does not repeat itself. Please feel free to contact me prior to your next visit and I will ensure you have a fantastic visit. Thank you again for writing. All my best, Shannon shannon.fosterhotelsolamar.com
0	DO NOT STAY HERE. My family and I checked in on Thursday 9/21 around 9pm. The parking lot was very small and hard to get a spot. When we finally got in the lobby, it looked clean and presentable. Our room was an entirely different story. It was facing outside by the pool. The light was already on in our room before we entered. Once we got in I was immediately disgusted. It smelled horrible (almost like a really bad sulfur), room looked very outdated and unappealing. Room was small, beds were old and I was so grossed out. I went to the front desk and explained how disappointed I was and they let me look at a few other rooms they offered--all of them terrible. We stayed put as there was no sense in moving to another awful room and quickly went to bed. When I woke up the next morning there were TWO cockroaches in the bathroom. YUCK! Southern California, I get it, bugs can happen. Every other hotel we stayed at for the rest of the week was so lovely. Very clean, up to date, and well kept. We had a few other family members that stayed in different rooms at this hotel and they were all equally displeased. STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL. It ran me 135 after 12 for parking. We had 3 more rooms reserved at this hotel again for that Sunday but we canceled them immediately. Gross, outdated, smelly, and OVERPRICED. Never again will I stay at this hotel! BUYER BEWARE. Also, when I checked out of the hotel, the man at the desk asked me how everything was. I told him You don't want to know and the didn't have any response...not a sorry, to hear that, nothing..Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey regarding your recent stay at our hotel. On behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for failing to exceed your expectations. Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you provided to make improvements to ensure we offer an exceptional experience for our guests in the future.I hope that you will consider staying with us again so that we can have another chance to provide you with a superior experience. Sincerely,Laura Benson Operations Manager Quality Suites Mission Valley
1	Great Girls Weekend. Estancia was perfect for a girls weekend (bachelorette party). Brett the concierge called the day prior to check on the reservation, and also worked diligently to get our group of rooms together. The grounds are beautiful and the rooms are very nice- especially the FRESH brand products in the bathroom!The highlight of the trip was the service we received at the pool. We rented 2 day beds for the day and Himiko was amazing. She was always checking in on us and provided fast and accurate service (our many drink orders were always right!).Dear RaRaP123456, We're delighted to hear that you and your friends had a great girls weekend at Estancia La Jolla. We're especially pleased to know that Brett and Himiko helped make your celebration special. We appreciate your feedback and hope to welcome you back soon for another La Jolla getaway.
1	Good Value. Not realizing it would be Father's Day, and the golf tournament was going on, I was finding it difficult to book a decent and affordable room for this weekend. We were very pleased to find this place, perfectly located for the things we had planned in Seattle. The customer service was wonderful, the building was nice and clean and safe. Free breakfast and parking too. Only downside Other guests who can't be quiet. Some of us like to sleep past 5:30 am! I called the front desk to comment about it on the second morning, and I think they called the offenders, because it did quiet them down a little.Thank you for your feedback. We are pleased to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us, and we hope to see you again the next time you're in the Seattle area!
0	Would never go Back. Days Inn Orlando Fl 5858 international dive by Wet N Wild, 7-11, and Red Lobster.Would pick a better Hotel next time. For starters they advertise to give shuttles to the parks however that shuttle service is one drop off time and a few pick up times. We were going to Universal Studio which opens at 10 but the shuttle doesnt leave until 10:45. The park closes at 8 but the shuttle picks up at 7:15 and 10:15. However Universal studios is in walking distance, so we choice to walk. It took us about 20 minutes to walk along with a wheelchair, so many may be able to walk faster. Also the shuttle require a 24 hour notice for wheelchairs. So since we didnt know exactly when we would need them ahead of time we were not able to use their shuttle.We started in room 275. We let the front desk know that we needed a fridge, as we have meds that have to be kept cold, and they did get us a fridge. The fridge does keep things cold but doesnt seal on top. You can put your finger right into the fridge. So we put a towel on top to help keep things out and the fridge cold. Fridges and Microwaves are available for an extra 10 charge. However, the next day, we found some uninvited bugs in our room. Not the end of world but I really am bug-a-phobic. I called the front desk and asked them to send someone to spray while we were out. When we got back they had the fan on in the bathroom and we didnt see anything.. But the next morning we I had to turn the light on for the bathroom we found more. We quickly got dress as we kept finding more and my husband went to speak the manager. We were asked to wait a half hour for the manager to come in. Half hour later, the manager was in a meeting so my husband told the front desk lady the issues. They called in a contractor to spray and moved us to room 105. The new room was much bigger and nicer looking. Plus it had a table and two chairs which was not in the other room.The door to room 275 didnt really seal at all. You could see the light from outside and pizza places where putting ads/coupons in the door frames. The ads would come right through the right side of the door and fall to floor a few feet in. In room 105 the door sealed better but there were people outside smoking and talking and you could totally hear them plus smell their smoking in the room. At least the ads got stuck in the door. Everything went ok after that except for toilet overflowing once. My husband quickly shut off the water to the toilet and we put down towels on the floor. I called the front desk and a lady came down to our room and asked what was wrong, although I explained it over the phone. They sent down the maintenance guy who just fixed the toilet. My husband asked if it was going to get cleaned up and we were told yes but that is housekeepings job. 15 minutes later we recalled the front desk and asked if someone was going to clean up the mess and bring us new towels. We had used towel to clean up the water. Housekeeping was around shortly after to cleanup and put in new towels. Other issue with the room beside it being run down was hearing everything that was going on outside.The hotel does not have a continental breakfast but they told us there is a Deli but we just went to Wal-Mart for quick breakfast foods. There is also 7-11 two spots down and Dennys and I-Hop are across the street.The interest is also issues at this hotel. There is Wi-Fi here but often the internet will not work. I know the issue is not my computer as my laptop is running just fine. I took the downtime to do extra maintenance work and write start to write this review.Our children did try the pool but shortly came back because they said it was cold and not that clean.. However it was a windy day so that may be why. Over all about a two star hotel which does have some issues but they are in the perfect location with Wet n Wild being about a block, Universal Studios in walking distance, and the I-trolley stop for SeaWorld and anything else on international drive as one the trolley I-ride stop is just across the street. For me I would rather stay at one of the nicer hotels, which seem to be closer to SeaWorld as the ones on the south side of International Drive look a bit older and run down.
1	Fabulous. We stayed at Pantai for 12 days for our 36th anniversary. We thank them for an exemplary experience. Our room was immaculate, quiet, with a gorgeous view. Just be aware that some of the rooms are a bit dated, and some are also near the staff work areas and can be noisy. The best part of Pantai is the staff! Every one is friendly and professional. Thank you especially to Nina for reservations, Alfred for all his recommendations for things to do in LaJolla, and to chef Fernando for imaginative and delicious breakfasts. Pantai is run like a family business at its best, with caring and attention to all detail. Thanks for a great vacation and we plan to return in a year for a wonderful break from our Wisconsin winter. Lynn McWIlliamsDear lynn m,Once again, Congratulations on your 36th anniversary! Were thrilled you chose to spend your time at the Pantai Inn. It was truly our pleasure. You left a lasting impression amongst our staff and we are excited for your return next year. Thank you very much for staying with us and for delivering such generous feedback. I especially appreciate your warm words about our staff. We take great pride in our service and its so nice to hear that positive affirmation from our guests. I will be sure to share your comments with everyone here at Pantai Inn. Thank you again for staying with us and we look forward to your return.Warm wishes,Dan Priano
1	Good base for exploring. We stayed here for five days in the beginning of November. The location is fine for exploring San Francisco, close to transportation and only about ten minutes away from Union Square. The staff were very helpful and friendly. Our early morning wake up call for the half marathon was as requested. We really enjoyed our stay. The coffee in the lobby is great for early mornings.Thank you so much for your review and the compliments about our location, coffee and our friendly staff. I'm delighted that you had a good stay and that you had fun running the half marathon. We look forward to having again.Jaime GonzalezFront Office ManagerHotel Vertigo
0	Falsely advertised. Sorry to have to say that this was a total disappointment. When I checked in, I was told that someone had called and cancelled the last two nights. I informed the clerk that did not happen and she argued that there was a note on the booking. I should have left then. The room was sprayed with something to cover... More
1	A Quality, Service Minded, Modestly Priced Hotel in Napa!. I coordinated a group of 23 visiting Napa during the grape harvest in October, and we booked the entire group into the Best Western Plus Inn at the Vines. First, let me say if youre a snob and really into posh places with fancy marble lobby floors, fluffy robes on the hook, perky concierge behind a big desk, etc. this may not be for you. But if you like to get real value, service and comfortable accommodations for a modest price, you cannot beat the Inn at the Vines. It is family owned and operated (several generations), and the service and sense of community are notable in this day and age. The place has been updated and has all the features you need..clean well furnished rooms, flat screens, very comfortable beds (we had king bed rooms), great towels, and organic soaps. To some earlier reviews about highway noise: we found it minimal and no one in our group complained. Yes, I did hear the occasional truck early in the morning or California kid with a Flowmaster exhaust doing a jack-rabbit start from the intersectionagain it was not a problem. Ask for a room in the back of the hotel. Front Desk Manager Shanirra did an exceptional job booking our customized winery tour, restaurant reservations, and balloon rides. As our person on the ground in Napa she was in our corner every step of the way and played a large part of a successful three days in Napa! At the front desk Melody, Shawn and Bertha were always helpful, upbeat and service-minded. Complimentary hotel breakfasts are a joke at many hotels.not so at the Inn at the Vines. There is a Dennys on the property, and you get a legitimate complimentary hot breakfast at the restaurant not some dinky room off the lobby. Try eggs any way you want, bacon/sausage and pancakes/toast and coffee. You cant beat it unless you must have Eggs Benedict and mimosas. The owners are continuously making improvements to keep up with newer hotels. During out stay a fitness center and business center were under construction. Botom line: when visiting Napa in the future I will stay at the Inn at the Vines again. Our entire group was pleased.Ed,it was a pleasure meeting you and hosting your group for your stay in the Napa Valley. I enjoyed hearing your story of what happened at the Castle. Yes, Shanirra is a great employee who is always the first to try out new restaurants and tours. All of our employees keep up to date on all there is to do in the Valley. We are family run (4th generation), and as you saw, we take pride in our Hotel. I am glad your group enjoyed their stay and maybe we can make this an annual event.
0	smell. I had booked this hotel for my mom on a last min. when i tryed to call to see if my mom checked in thay did not ansewer the phones for about 2 hrs straight had to call the 800 to see if she got there.. she had told me the next morning that the room smelled musty and was not as clean she expected paying 100.00 + for the night we will say we will not be back there...
1	A Quiet Retreat on the Edge of the French Quarter. This small, almost boutique hotel on the boundary of the French Quarter offers a quiet respite from the hullabaloo of Bourbon Street, and the French Market just three blocks away. In the centre of the hotel is a shaded, landscaped courtyard with an al fresco dining area, and swimming pool. The rooms are clean,comfortable and roomy, with good amenities. The staff are very welcoming, friendly, and helpful with booking tours, and answering questions. Breakfast was varied and delicious. There is a welcoming bar and lounge, which is a great place to meet fellow travellers.Thank you Sue for taking the time to write such a detailed review about our property! Our future guests will be able to use this to help picture their stay with us. We greatly appreciate you staying with us and hope you will come back and see us again soon.
0	IS THAT URINE. It's motel 6 so of course I didn't expect the Taj Mahal but when your on the road for hours and are looking forward to paying for comfort but when you arrive there are tweakers all over the stairs and parking lot, dogs barking in the next room and the room you PAID for has an the overbearing stench of... More
1	Unlucky room. The hotel was located near union square, which is a good place to get anywhere else in the city. However, my room was located on the ground floor and my window faced a dark alley, so I didn't get any daylight. Plus it was really loud even at night which made sleeping difficult. The hotel and service were great otherwise, I guess I got a bad room and no discount on it, so for me it wasn't worth the high price.Thank you for sharing your recent stay with us. We are happy to hear you enjoyed our friendly service and central location. I am very sorry you were unhappy with your room. We do have staff available that can assist with a room move if we have something different available. We greatly appreciate your feedback and hope to impress you on a future visit. Thanks again.
0	Did not clean my room. My brother was in the hospital, and I needed to be there for him. Did not want anything problems until this hotel was not very satisfying. The first night, the hotel only took the trash out in my room. So I made a comment to the front desk, is this unusually just to take the trash out. So she made a note to the cleaning dept. The next night my room was not cleaned at all, so you can imagine how upset I was. One night not cleaned, but two nights. When I complaint again, the front desk just told me it's not there problem. It's the cleaning employees so this upset me even more. They did give me some clean towels for that night so I can shower. Also, I felt the breakfast area was not kept up with the cleaning. Very messy. I would not recommend to stay here. But I did have a king size bed, and it was very comfortable.
1	Great hotel for families. Nice hotel for families. We booked a 1 bedroom suite with 2 queen beds room. Lots of space and very clean. However, these rooms unfortunately do not have a very good view - they look into other rooms and courtyard. I think the studios have good views of the Space Needle. The breakfast buffet is great. Location is great - right across from Space Needle. We walked to Pike Place Market - a long but very doable walk.SFCALUSA,We are sincerely appreciative of your complimentary remarks on your experience at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown. I have shared your feedback with the team as we pride ourselves on the things we do right and how we can continually improve. Safe travels we hope to see you again while visiting the area!Sarah Junge
1	Perfect Spot for a New Orleans vacation. If you want a hotel close to the French Quarter rather than in it with all its noise, crowds and street entertainers and scam artists this is the perfect place. You are only four blocks from Canal Street, Bourbon Street and Royal Street or the streetcar stops right outside the hotel if you don't feel like walking. 3 for a 24 hour pass is a good deal and an easy way to move around all the key tourist areas. The Drury Inn offers excellent accommodation for the money: we had an oversized 2 room suite King Bed Non-Smoking suite for five nights which was clean, comfortable, well laid out. The Breakfast and Kick Back offerings should be seen as a bonus: it's quite naturally geared to US tastes and if you like what's on offer then enjoy (we did for the most part) if not then there are plenty of good eating spots within easy reach. As for the three alcoholic drinks each night what's to complain about Just be aware there are quite long lines on Friday and Saturday nights. Finally, many thanks to Kyle, Assistant General Manager, for the useful chats we had about New Orleans/ Memphis and Daniel always helpful and courteous in the dining room.
0	TERRIBLE HOTEL. THE STAFFS HAVE NO MANNERS, THE ROOM WAS DIRTY, PILLOWS WERE STING, THE ELEVATOR HAD WATER, WE NEED TO BRING OUR LUGGAGE UP TO GET OUT OF THE DIRTY WATER.
0	If this is a Plus property....yikes!. I wish tripadvisor had 1/2 stars for our use because I would have given this a 2 1/2...3 is too high. This was our first hotel of 8 different ones on our Napa/Pacific Coast vacation, so I have a lot to compare it to. I have many other reviews on this site and I try to be fair when reviewing any property we've sayed at.Having said that.....It was my first experience at a Best Western brand and if this is a plus property I would not want to stay at a non-plus one.I disagree with the person responding to all of the other reviews...this is not a good value or comparable value to other hotels in the area. Who are you comparing yourself with When comparing properties you need to look at the amenities of hotels in your price range. You are priced as high as other properties but those properties have better/more amenities or are closer to vineyards, therefore it's not a fair comparison. It's like comparing apples and oranges...both fruits but there are many different qualities. Now back to the property....Don't expect to see any vines even though the word is in the name. This is located on a very busy road surrounded by stores and restaurants. If that's what you're looking for, great book it, just be aware that there will be a lot of traffic noise and light polution.Cons....The pool's capacity is 8 people. That should tell you something about the size. I'd guess it's 8X10' (that's probably a generous estimate). In my opinion putting in a couple of extra hottubs instead of the tiny pool would have been more beneficial. The balcony we had was so closed in and dark. The solid front and sides don't allow you to see anything when sitting in the chairs, not that the view was great....we looked out over Denny's roof and a traffic light. Oh, Dennys. sigh.....went our first 2 mornings. Ordered the free entree of 2 eggs, 2 pancakes and 2 bacon or sausage. Getting a hot entree I guess is impossible, the food was cold to the touch. My husband faced the kitchen and saw the breakfasts sitting up on the counter for a long period of time before the waitress bothered to serve it. There were maybe 4 other parties in the restaurant at the time, not busy at all. The tea water was luke warm at best. Total waste of my time.Location...not your romantic getaway place by any means. About 20 to 25 minutes to the heart of Napa's wine country depending on traffic. In hinesight I would not have booked this hotel if not for the MANY( now suspicious in my mind)...reviews. I find it hard to believe that this many people think this hotel is the best. Really After spending 3 days in Napa and seeing many other hotels closer to the wineries, I question the validity of these raving reviews.Pros....Yes there are a few...I promised a fair review and that's what I deliver.Shower....best shower head of any hotel. In fact I'm looking for one for my own shower.Cleanliness....our room was very clean. Small in size in comparison to other hotels on our trip and just an armoire instead of a closet. Microwave, fridge and coffee pot was a nice convenience.Bed/pillows....very comfortable.So if you're looking for a clean place to sleep that's a bit overpriced than book this hotel. If you want to see vineyards from your balcony and sit by a nice pool...don't book this property. At most I would expect to pay under 100 a night for this property based on it's location and lack of amenities. All the renovations in the world don't matter to me if they're not available when I'm there. They need to charge accordingly.We paid 537 for Saturday, Sunday and Monday evenings. I now know we could have spent the same money and stayed at a better property. Oh well, live and learn.Thank you for your detailed review. First, we do compare our hotel to our competition by actually going to all the hotels in our class and looking at their rooms and overall condition of their property. Each hotel will have their pluses and minuses. We also shop prices on a daily basis and we make sure we are competitive in our market. We actually have all the prices of the hotels on the days you stayed and only one hotel was less than our price and its located 9 miles south of Napa, further away from the vineyards. On average you would have paid between 75 -200 more for your stay in a comparable hotel.All Best Westerns that have at least a 3 diamond recognition from AAA have the opportunity to be a PLUS property as long as they have a PIP( property Improvement Plan) in place. With the cost that runs in the hundreds of thousands of dollars it will take time for each property to complete. There is a time frame on completing this and we are well ahead of the deadlines. Our rates are similar to last years (before Plus) and we have added breakfast at Dennys and many more amenities. We never hide the fact that we have a small pool (12x 184). There are pool area pictures displayed on our website and other 3rd party sites. When a guest inquires about the pool we let them know that we have a small pool. We recommend other hotels if a guest are looking for a larger pool.As for reviews, all reviews are honest and we know that there will be a difference of opinions and as you can see we are rated in the middle of the hotels in Napa. We are a family run hotel and take pride in our hotel and are always looking at ways to improve. TripAdvisor is way too smart to let suspicious reviews slip through as it is their reputation and ours.Thank you for your compliments on the cleanliness of our rooms, (we are an ultra clean property) our shower heads and beds. The shower heads are by Delta and Ive actually seen them at Home Depot. The bed that was in your room is a Cheshire IV pillow top by Serta. Thank you again for your review.
1	Great hotel. This hotel was awesome the rooms were great the staff was awesome the location was perfect the only draw back to this hotel is the 40 for valet parking however there are other cheaper options close to the hotel the roof top bar was really cool the breakfast was excellent overall the hotel gets a 97 out of 100 score from meThank you so much for taking the time to share this great review of your stay and we are delighted to know how much you enjoyed our property and service provided. There are cheaper options of parking around the area which is due to them having less labor and security costs than ours but yes they are conveniently located should guests decide to utilize those options. Your business and feedback are very important to us and we look forward to having you stay with us again whenever your travels bring you back to New Orleans.Best regards,
0	Horrible. I hate it very disappointed. It is a dump I wouldn't suggest this place to my worst enemy!!
1	Good choice in NOLA. Staying in NOLA during Jazzfest-I opt to not stay in the French Quarter-too congested and noisy then. This is a perfect location for me: easy to go to CBD and Quarter (by car or Streetcar) and free parking. And easy to go to the Uptown area restaurants and clubs. Staff is super, and genuinely nice.There is so much to do when Jazzfest is going on in New Orleans! It sounds like you had a great time while you were here for it. Thank you for taking the time to review your stay with us. I'll pass along your compliments to the staff! Give us a call the next time you are ready to visit New Orleans!

0	Fourth Visit starting off like last. Last trip I refrained from reviewing after a rather bad experience. I believed it was a one shot occurrence. Last trip, I was given room keys that didn't work for the parking. Returned to the desk and received a lukewarm sorry. I stayed for 4 nights. My room was left completely un-cleaned one day and not well cleaned the other. When I informed the front desk, another lukewarm sorry. After I asked to see the manager, the desk person offered reward points instead because the manager was not available. Arrived today, front parking attendant asked for my car key while I checked into the hotel. Mind you, the front desk is in view from the entry way. I haven't been asked that in the last 2 visits. I asked him why and he said that people parked there and left their cars. He needed my key in case I did that. He reluctantly gave me a ticket after I asked - his reasoning was I can see you from here at the desk. Huh Wasn't that my reasoning as well except as the customer A rewards member, I was asked for my information though the person making the reservation a month ago took all my information. Got my keys - one opens the parking deck and one opens the room door, but neither does both. Can't wait to see what else I encounter while here.
0	very poor motel. The worse motel stay. I will never stay here again. Corrosion on the faucets. They stressed no smoking in the rooms and have you sign acknowledgement. However, when i entered my room the smell of cigarettes met me at the door. After I complained they sprayed a deodorizer. Let me say cigarettes and deodorizer cover don't smell good. I then... More
0	Huge Disappointment. The hotel is in a wonderful location near the river. Unfortunately, they have too many issues. The rooms are outdated and many of the basic features (outlets, dresser drawers, phones) did not work. The food was consistently cold and of poor quality. Most importantly, the customer service was exceptionally poor throughout the entire facility.
0	Just a terrible hotel in a great location. Location: The location is great. It's just a few minutes to the 72nd street subway, The Dakota where Lennon was shot, Central Park and Strawberry Fields. The neighborhood is very residential and in a no-honk zone which makes it quiet. This is about the only good thing about the hotelHotel: The hotel can't even really be called a hotel. It's a youth hostel without an age restriction. In each room you get a bed, a small TV a mirror and a sink. That's it! You have to leave a deposit at the front desk for sheets and they are not the cleanest in the world. The bathrooms are shared. Each bathroom has a toilet and a shower. Imagine how long it takes for you to wait to do your business in the morning! The lifts are ancient and slow. The front desk could really care less about you being there.The only reason we booked this hotel was because we needed to get to New York on the cheap for my wife to audition for the show Project Runway. There was some other even going on at the time and hotel prices were 3X what they usually go for. For 100 a night, we weren't expecting much. I think that I would have felt ripped off at 20.Stay away...stay FAR FAR away!
1	Warm cookies.... great stay. I stayed at Hilton Garden Inn, Miami for a business trip. It's a nicely built hotel with good service and close proximity to the airport and business centers. Shopping is also not far away with Dolphin mall near to the hotel..... great place to shop.....you may want to take help from the front desk for nearby attractions (not many for a city like Miami though)Nicely kept jacuzzi pool are added advantage.... try the warm chocolate cookies at the reception, they are nice after a swimming session....Shuttle service to/from airport is useful, and if you're lucky, you may get dropped /picked from some shopping malls near by as well :)Good hotel if you have to stay near airport for some reason....
0	Time to close the Waterfront. Have used the Waterfront for years, through different owners, and know it will soon become Marriott. In the meantime it should close. Staff remain friendly West Virginians, although almost all were 'trainees thats the high point. Room had the dirtiest carpet I have ever seen in a hotel Dirty towel was found hanging over the shower rod. holes in the... More
0	Not the worst place I've stayed... Believe it or not. After a very busy day of Driving and a long Chiefs game down in Syracuse we made our way towards the border to get back home, Watertown, NY was the last stop, it was late, everything in town was booked solid, EVERYTHING... Even My hotels.com account wouldn't show results. We were referred to The Roadway Inn by the night shift... More
1	Would stay here again- good value in New Orleans. My husband and I stayed here during Jazz Fest in early May. The hotel isn't much to look at from the outside- it appears to be an older building. We had a king room on the 7th floor- the view was of a parking lot with graffiti on the walls. The room was perfectly adequate though- the bed was comfy, shower pressure good, and we didn't hear any noise from outside or within the hotel. Nice and quiet- we slept great. The 5:30 kickback was great! Free drinks and appetizers. I just wish it lasted more than an hour since we didn't make it back to the hotel in time each night for it. The breakfast was fresh and plentiful as well. Waffle maker, hot buffet items, juices, etc. And included in the cost of the hotel room- a great plus. The hotel was a short walk from French quarter and other areas of interest. The city bus ran close by to the hotel- we took this to the City Park and rode bikes, as well as to the Jazz Fest. The price for our room was pretty steep since it was during Jazz Fest- but we still felt like it was a good value and in line with other hotels in the area. Parking was 25 a night plus tax. The hotel is still undergoing renovations- it looks like the parking garage will be attached to the building rather than 10 minutes away which will be nice. Overall would recommend staying here- no reservations!
0	Disappointing We would look elsewhere next time. Just finished a 2 night stay. There were a few positives but my initial 3/5 evaluation was influenced downward by the unfavourable opinions of my brother and adult son who traveled with me. Pluses included a breakfast with hot options and adequate space for seating, not always a given. The front end staff were friendly. The room was good value for a name brand this time of year.The small room however was below par in several ways. Had I been with my wife, I would have requested a move. Most critically, it was excessively musty smelling, noticeable as the door opened. The carpet felt damp and the issue was illustrated by the delamination on the doors of the cabinet. This had to be an undoing issue. There was a large piece of sticky green gum stuck to the seat of the lounge chair, impossible to miss during housekeeping. The toilet ran constantly. Lessor issues include limited toiletries such as a single bar of soap to share between the sink and (separate) shower areas. The lighting in the shower area was weak leaving the shower in shadow. All in all, given the miriad of options in the area, I'd suggest guests look elsewhere.
0	poor visit. Room had funny smell, bugs, no phone no clock, no iron, bathroom was dirty. The room was just not very nice and they couldn't put us next to our family even though there was no one in the room next to us the entire stay. The only good thing was it's location and price but I guess you get what you pay for. They only had one room key. We be choosing another hotel next time...and we don't recommend it. I have stayed at Days Inn hotels and have had nothing but good experiences until this visit.
1	Thank you Hampton Inn for thawing me out!. If you've seen the movie Trains, Planes and Automobiles, you can partially gain an insight as to what my staff and I went through during the 2007 Valentine's Day storm trying to leave New York City to head back to Los Angeles. I'll spare you the ugly details of what happened, but I can say that the ordeal ended on a very positive note. Somehow we wound up in Philadelphia en route to the Philadelphia airport and needed a clean, warm, close place to stay along with important features such as free hi-speed Internet access and a hot breakfast. The Hampton Inn was remarkable. The staff was gracious and the rooms were very pleasant. Little touches such as a long Ethernet cable that extended across the room, warm fresh cookies served in the lobby and free shuttle service from the train and to the airport made all the difference in 16 degree weather. We made it back to Los Angeles a few days later than planned, but the Hampton Inn made that delay manageable.
1	GREAT STAY. We checked in late on Friday night. The desk clerk was very friendly and quick to help us get checked in. The only issue wass when we went to get in the room. You could only turn the handle upward to open the door. We met Alicia, manager at the front desk. the next morning. She was very informative of the surrounding area and helped us get around to places that we wanted to go to. The bathroom and whole room was very clean and pleasant. The whole staff were friendly professional. This will be my hotel of choice when I come to the Phoenix area. Thanks to Alicia and all the staff for helping in making it a great weekend stay.
1	Wonderful place to stay. Great place to stay, Justin at the front desk gave us a warm welcome. Our room was really nice and clean. We really appreciated the service that Maria our breakfast attendant gave us during our morning.Dear Rafa2408,Thank you for taking the time to review your stay, I 'am delighted to hear you enjoyed your suite and the service our staff provided. We work extremely hard to ensure we provide exceptional service to each and every guest. I will ensure I give Justin his kudos for the service he provided! Thank you again for your time and we hope to serve you again when your travels bring you back to Scripps, Poway.
1	Great All the Way Around. What can I say it is the St Regis. This is a newer building and everything is done with taste and thought. From driving up to walking into check in, to your room. Decor: Very contemporary, but comfortable. Unlike the W which goes for modern mostly the St. Regis San Francisco keeps it clean and contemporary yet tasteful and comfortable. Great earth tone colors and tasteful art through out the building. Food: They have a lobby lounge which is great for just hanging out, having a meeting, or wanting to have a little snack. Nice atmosphere not too quiet, not too loud. They have Art of Tea which is served daily between 2-4pm and reservation are recommended, and finally their restaurant the Grill which is a contemporary dining. Beautiful dishes, great tastes and really if you just want a nice dinner without leaving the hotel you really can't go wrong, but again you are in San Francisco.. Rooms: Well the rooms as I said are amazing. Very clean, very contemporary but comfortable. huge windows allow you to see amazing views of the city and parks. Everything is automated, the bathrooms are large and comfortable. If you like the finer things in life, or want to take your partner on a romantic night this is it. Staff: Again A+ the entire experience was amazing including their staff. The butler service was on point and I really have zero complaints.. A+Dear petewright09,We appreciate you taking the time to share a review about your recent experience at the St. Regis San Francisco. We are thrilled that you enjoyed the guestroom dcor, our culinary offerings and felt well accommodated by our staff and butler service. We look forward to welcoming you back to the best address in the near future. Warm regards,Andr BroseHotel Manager
0	Just the basics. First of all, I read these reviews alot and I am always suprised at how picky some people are. We are not that way and are usually looking for something that is a good deal even if it's not the greatest hotel. Having said that, this is my review. Got into the hotel at 11:30 at night after 11 hours of driving to find that the air conditioning in our room did not work. The front desk clerk was extremely rude and very difficult to work with, however a security/maintence guy was more than helpful and after about 45 minutes we were transfered to a new room. The hotel is extremely basic if that is what you are looking for. It is in the middle of roads and highways and overpasses and really has no character at all. If you are looking for a one or two night stay at a cheap price it's not too bad. The hotel does have a decent free breakfast, but if it gets to busy, it is very chaotic, crowded and dirty. There are several other hotels nearby that I would try first if we ever came to DC again.
1	Quiet and near what we needed. This hotel had great staff. They promptly got us checked in, helped us with information on Napa Valley wineries. The room and bathroom were exceptionally clean. Bed was very comfortable. Free internet met our needs. Hotel breakfast was vouchers for the Denny's on hotel property. That was nice to have a full breakfast. Property was clean. Our room was quiet (202) with minimal noise from hallway or street. We were able to get good nights rests. Love the microwave and empty frig in the room. Room rate was high due to us being there during an event that this hotel was associated with. So the limited supply and high demand rates were in effect.Katrina,We are glad you enjoyed your stay and it is always good to hear that my staff gave exceptional service. Hope to see you again on your next visit to Napa.
0	Absolutely Disgusting. The place is in an absolutely secluded area, made me extremely nervous to leave my vehicle in such a place.The rooms..... Absolutely disgusting, there was a roach crawling on the bathroom floor. Mirrors were disgusting as well.I would dodge this hotel like roaches dodge light.
0	You get what you pay for. If you are just looking for a cheaper hotel in Del Mar, this may even be a fair choice, if you don't mind very dirty rooms, no parking spaces if you arrive after 10 PM, scant breakfast if you get it after 8:30 AM and practically unresistant concierge service.
1	Great Stay in Atlanta. My family and I stayed at the Fairfield Inn in Buckhead for three nights. Our stay was great! Check in was easy and the clerk was very friendly and helpful. We were upgraded to a suite which worked out well since we have twin 1 year olds and the extra space made our stay much more comfortable. Our room was very clean and parking and internet were both free. There was also a free breakfast in the morning which had a make-your-own-waffle station, eggs, bacon, fresh cut fruit and surprisingly good coffee. The girls who worked the breakfast were always happy and smiling and did a good job keeping everything full. Both mornings we went downstairs for breakfast, the manager was there walking around talking to people and she even brought little toys to our table for the twins! We didn't get a chance to use the pool, but it looked clean and well maintained. The hotel overall was quiet and clean. The bed was wonderful and slept like a dream. But the best part of this stay was by far the staff. They were all so kind and always smiling and eager to help and never seemed too busy to take the time to answer our questions. This Fairfield was definitely a winner! We will definitely stay again.Thank you Tabitha for taking the time to review our property. It is our goal to make sure that we do everything we can to make our guests comfortable. I am so glad that you and your family enjoyed your upgraded room, our complimentary hot breakfast and our welcoming staff. I hope that the next time you find yourself in the Buckhead area, you will come and visit us again! Thank you again for recommending us!
1	Loved the room and location. Can't go wrong with this hotel. Beautiful rooms and super close to all activity around town. It's situated on 8th street, so a leisurely walk down to 1st takes you to the Pike St markets. Hertz rental car is also based in the car park of the building, so really convenient if you want to drop off or pick up a rental. Staff all really helpful and really pleasant. We had a great stay.Thank you for your notes. We love that our central downtown location allows our guests to easily get to great restaurants, shopping, and entertainment. Please come back and see us on your next visit to Seattle.Sarah S.Guest Relations Manager
0	Do you want to hear cars in the highway. This hotel in on Hotel Circle not far tho old san diego, but really near from highways. The room was cleam, but really small. There is a restaurant and a free access to Internet. Cheap, but you could maybe find something more interestinf near the ocean. You could maybe have a few difficulties to park your car (there aren't many places in the area. Here, you will see only the cars...
0	Unfortunate Experience. Poor cleanliness. Lack of attention to coffee station. Selected room online and put somewhere else. Breakfast selections were limited. Dishes not clean at breakfast. Parking was a fiasco. Would never stay here again. Would run to the nearest alternative hotel.
1	I enjoy my stay. Staff was very friendly, the breakfast was real good there was a lot to choose from, room was clean, bathroom was clean the only thing that was wrong in my room 227 is , the shower needs more water pressure, it took me twice as long to take a shower due to how slow the water was flowing.but over all I was very satisfied with my stay.Thank you for providing us with your feedback regarding our property. I'd like to start by apologizing for the inconveniences with the shower, I will take your concerns up to our general manager. On the other hand, I'm glad that the rest of your stay was enjoyable and we hope that you will choose to stay with us again.
0	Could not have been treated more poorly. Counter staff tried to be helpful, however my problem needed the manager's attention. He was not on site, but could be reached by phone, but refused to talk with me. The lobby smelled like smoke and I wanted to cancel my reservation., which required his ok. Refused to do that or talk with me about my concerns. Consider this motel... More
0	saty. It was one of the most terrible experiences that I have ever had, me may wife and sister all felt the same way. I want ever stay at a Hampton Inn again. The Internet didn't work consistently, my grandson couldn't play his xbox 360 at all because of the internet.
1	Staff went above and beyond to help us.... We took our two grand children to see DC and stayed at the Embassy because of its convenience to the city. Our grandson has extreme food restrictions due to food alergies so we were not sure how this trip would go. It was his first trip away from home. TWe explained to the chef and server that he needed special food preparation and care. They went far and above to make sure his needs were met and to follow up that he was taken care of. Thanks to these good folks we feel more comfortable about travelling with him. The Embassy staff made this a great summer for our grandson.
1	A Good Location Hotel. Arrived at the Hotel from Dulles airport at 15:50 the young man on the reception who introduced himself as B was at once friendly and welcoming and made a good first impression. The hotel although a bit dated is clean and easy to get around, the room I was in was spacious and with the benefit of it's own kitchen a blessing after a long day sight seeing. A shuttle bus runs frequently to and from the hotel to Rosslyn Metro station and the driver helpful and friendly, although if the weather is nice a walk down the hill is to Rosslyn and the Metro is no more than 10 minutes. All in all a good hotel and location with easy access to Washington DC.
1	We always stay here wilst passing through Dallas. Aloft in Downtown Dallas is affordable, and the decor is hip modern (and slightly cheesy, but refreshing and beautiful in contrast to the souless reds, beiges and florals of most chain hotels). The rooms are spacious and comfortable, and the bathroom is stocked with Bliss products. We ate at the bar on our second stay because it was kind of late and we were driving a Penske ... I'd find somewhere else to eat next time. It wasn't gross, it just tasted like it came out of a freezer. Overall I'm fond of this place and wish Aloft would replace the Days and Holiday Inns of the world.
0	I paid but didnt stay. Worst place ever for family room was smelly and office staff not helpful
1	Lovely Hotel, super comfy beds. I stay at the Waverly every November for work. We have a very large group and essentially take over the hotel and all the conference rooms and also rent out the trade show facility at the Cobb Galleria that is attached. The hotel is VERY clean and the rooms are very pretty, spacious and comfy. The beds are the best hotel beds I've ever slept in. Triple sheeted, feather bed, lots of pillows, etc.My one compaint from the last trip was when the fire alarm went off in the middle of the night. I was on the 14th floor and the hotel is in the round, all the rooms look down into the atrium area. When the alarm went off I exited the room and looked down into the atrium to see what was going on. I could see a few people at the reception desk and a couple of girls behind it but no one from the hotel seemed to be directing people or even paying attention to the alarm. Lots of other people left their rooms as well and we kind of waited to see if anyone from the hotel would wave at us or give direction which never happened. The alarm did not shut off though. I decided to take the elevator down but because of the alarm the elevators were in lock down. It was around this time that I realized I had left my key in the room. I didn't want to take the stairs down 14 floors in my pajamas and bc no hotel staff seemed concerned with the alarm most people went back to their rooms. I used the phone in my co-worker's room to call to be let into my room and the desk agent said they were investigating the alarm. It took about 30 minutes for someone to open my room which was probably bc he had to climb those stairs. I'm still shocled and confused over how they handled the alarm. It was bizarre that they didn't have anyone directing people or telling us it was a false alarm, etc.Other than that it's a great hotel and the conference facilities are fantastic, the food is yummy and the rooms are lovely. Unfortunately you have to pay for internet.
1	Good hotel. Located a couple of block from Canal Street in New Orleans, this hotel provided efficient and highly satisfactory service. The front staff is very helpful. The bed and pillows were VERY comfortable, more comfortable than in any other hotel I have stayed in. Once I had an almost equally comfortable bed in a Hilton, but this was tops. I would definitely return to this hotel chain.Wow! Thankful you've taken the time to share your great feedback with us and the Trip Advisor community. We have the Westin Heavenly Bed System, they do have some items for retail purchase in case you wanted to check those out. See you next time,Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager
1	Beautiful, Quiet, Clean Place to stay!. The location wasn't exactly where i thought it was but that was partly my fault, there are 2 Fairfield's in Key west and I got confused with the second one. However it was nice and close to airport which is what I was looking for at first. The Hotel had a nice room, Clean, and everything you needed to just have a nice stay. They had a contential breakfast at the hotel and that was nice. It had a great selection with staff that worked really hard the entire time to keep everything stocked, cleaned, and looking nice. It was just a nice hotel all around and we couldn't beat the price. Very happy with our stay here.Dear Ashley663,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. We are Happy that you enjoyed your stay here with us. We hope you had a relaxing time here in Key West and we hope to see you back in again soon.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager
1	Felt like a vip.. Spent a few days roughing it in the mountains. Spent a day here shopping and eating. Excellent location. Attached to the Lenox mall. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Went out of their way to help. Really good culture they have developed at this hotel. Great pool. Great work out room. You are indeed a VIP and I am glad we exceeded your expectations. Our hotel is definitely the pace to come for shopping and eating. I hope the next time you spend a few days roughing it in the mountains you will plan to return to the life of luxury at the JW.
0	Noisy very thin walls. I would rate this Hotel Average/Poor. Stayed for a couple nights. The Hotel is located in Fishermans Wharf, a heavily crowded area. We knew this and wanted to give it a try. Mind you, the walls are VERY thin. This was our issue. After a few long days of touring and site seeing we wanted to come back, relax, and get a good night sleep for the next day. Didn't happen. We constantly were woke by people just casually passing in the hallway and could hear every single word from our neighbors next door. Full conversation. There may have not been a wall there at all! Our room was at the very end of the second floor (request a room away from the elevators so you don't hear constant noise) BUT our room's window had a view of the second story parking lot!!! People could see RIGHT into our room! Which made us have to close the window shades the entire time for privacy! Housekeeping came VERY early, 9:15am to be exact. We were still trying to sleep from being woken up off and on all through the night. The wifi didn't work. And the power went out due to the large blackout San Fran had while we were there. Not the Hotel's fault, but no one came to let us know what was going on, either. Overall, I would not stay here again. I think it's fine for a quick night in a popular tourist area, not for relaxing. Also, they offered to park our car for 65.00 ! TIP: Two doors down to the left of the hotel, there is a self parking garage for only 30.00 We did that, instead.
0	Decent Price for Spring Vacation. We stop here often if we cannot get a decent price in a WDW resort. We stayed here on our way back from the Masters golf tournament. After driving 8 hours from Augusta we tried to check in at 2:30PM but were told check in was 4PM and they had NOTHING available at that time. Desk clerk said she would... More
0	Worst Best Western EVER!!. Best Western should remove their affliation with this location. Room was so small, it was difficult to move around. In order to get past the bed and the wall at the end of the bed with your luggage, you literally had to walk side ways to get by. You had to shut the bathroom door to use the toilet or shower. I have a one car garage that was bigger than this room. And the room was NOT cheap!! Absolutely terrible!! Advice - find another location.
0	Business Trip not up to standard.. I book this travel for 2 of our employees for a 2 day business trip. Upon arrival they discovered one of the rooms had no bathroom light. When they contacted the desk they were asked what time they needed to take a shower because maintenance was gone. The staff seemed to not want to change his room or repair the light. After this employee got upset they then moved his room. This was a 10pm at night. The other rooms A/C was set to the lowest 60 and never got below 74. So the employee who was working in very hot conditions all day couldn't even cool off at night. Then there was the dinner. The employees found that dinner was two bowls of meat balls from 5-7pm. Nothing was replenished or taken care of. The signed in the hotel were wrong. Signed said vending but there was no vending that could be found. I was very embarrassed to have been the one to have booked this location for these two employees. I take pride in making sure all our employees have the nicest most reasonable stay possible when they have to travel for work. Now I am ashamed of this trip.
0	Pictures do not tell the truth. When I looked at the pictures , I thought that I have an excellent deal at hand but it turned out to be a total let down ...This hotel is not even worth comparing to a MOTEL6 or SUPER8 . It is run down and shabby . Will not stay here ever.
1	Awesome Anniversary. My husband and I visited NOLA to celebrate our first wedding anniversary this past weekend. Upon our late arrival, we were greeted by the Valet and Bell Boy and quickly checked in for our stay. There was a mix up with the room key which stalled our 'settling' for 30 minutes, but we were told that the woman that assigned us the keys was on medication from a dental operation. The room was lush but small - neither of us minded, since we would be tourist hopping and eating all day any...view moreway. The view was great, and we were pleased that it was located far enough from Bourbon that you couldn't hear the crazy screaming drunkenness (though, Saturday was a bit louder than Friday). Room service was excellent and speedy. Information was readily available and the hotel was really clean. We didn't get to explore the upper deck pool area or dine at the Rib Room, but plan on staying here again - it's in the middle of everything and a really great value!view less
0	Very Clean and Beautiful Motel. This motel is fantastic. Staff is very courteous and helpful. Grounds and impeccable. Rooms are so clean and comfortable. The only thing I suggest to the hotel is build a workout/exercise room. They do not have a workout facility or room. The Cozy Diner (Same parking lot) has wonderful food and follows the hotel with regards to cleanliness. An upscale... More
1	Good stay. Had a great stay, however no real complaints. I'm very picky with where I stay. The staff was beyond friendly, the hotel was well kept. They even had snacks when you enter and leave the hotel at the front door. Was very pleased. The only small issue was that the carpet in the room needed shampooing. I normally bring my slippers and forgot this time. Carpet had hair on floor needs better vacuuming and shampoo the walls in the room need touch up paint. It would literally take 20 min for when a quest leaves for walls to be touched up every so often. That was my only issue looking at a dirty wall. However I would stay again. Why are the racks for the towels inside the shower on the wall. Bad idea makes them get damp when you shower.
1	Wonderful place to stay in San Francisco. I was looking for a nice, clean hotel in a safe area that is affordable and I found it at the Orchard Garden! I'm so pleased. My room was a nice size, the service was excellent and the breakfast is a huge perk! I will be staying here every time I come to SF to visit my daughter. The location is perfect, you can walk everywhere. I highly recommend.It's wonderful that you enjoyed your room and our location. I'm glad you got to explore the area a bit. It means a lot that you'll be staying with us whenever you come to visit your daughter -- can't wait!All the best,Pablo B. General Manager
0	Bad experience never again. I am not a big fan of holiday inn but I came with a group It was not a good idea never again We left the hotel came back 5 pm and the room still not ready it was not clean from the beginning the service was ok location very good but it need more cleaning it was not really that cheapDear sam m: Thank you for taking the time to post your review and comment about your recent stay at the Holiday Inn Bayside. I was disappointed to learn that your recewnt visit to our hotel had not met your expectations. Indeed, cleanliness are standard expectations for our hotel, and it disturbs me that your experience has been otherwise. I will review your experience with our Housekeeping staff emphasizing the importance of cleaning the room the best possible way and also cleaning it on time. Again, my apologies for not meeting your expectations and delivering the quality of service that you deserve. If your travel brings you back to San Diego, I do hope you allow us the opportunity to provide you the service and quality that we have both come to expect. Sincerely, Rhinna B Meyer - Rooms Division Manager
0	This motel is a flea bag, welfare dump.. This motel should not be listed as an option. The rooms smell dank and the bathroom has a lot of black mold the carpet is torn, the curtains hang by a thread. It's a place good only for the drunkards and other destitute residents who live there semi-permanently. It's a disgrace.
1	Good place to stay near the airport. I always use Hilton hotels. This one is the usual high quality I expect from them. Despite being close to the airport, I was not bothered by any aircraft noise. Definitely would stay here again. Hooters is next door and there are several other restaurants about 10 minute walk from the hotel. We appreciate your wonderful remarks about your recent visit to the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport. I am delighted to read that you had a great stay, and we appreciate your loyalty towards our brand. We are glad you enjoyed our proximity to the airport as well as area restaurants which was convenient for your needs. Thanks for being our valued guest, and we look forward to welcoming you back soon! All the Best,Debra Thompson-FrenchGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport
1	Outstanding Hotel 5 star!. All staff was great! Room was beautiful. View from our room was gorgeous. Concierge planned our travel around San Francisco and it was the best. Everyone made our stay very nice. We will return here in the future!Dear Chris G.,Thank you for taking the time to share your review of your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco. I am delighted to hear that you had an exceptional stay and sincerely appreciate your kind words regarding our staff, service and guestroom dcor. Please do not hesitate to contact me directly prior to your next stay, as we hope to welcome you back to the Best Address in the near future.Sincerely, Anthony Duggan Hotel Manager 415-284-4057 anthony.dugganstregis.com
0	lower than average hostel. I spent 3 nights in this hostel, it's grand if you just want to lay your head down for a couple of hours. But you wouldn't want to spend a lot of time in your room. The place is very smelly, our rooms stank. It is in a very good location, everything you need is just around the corner. There is a free bar in the hostel, but it only lasts for about an hour so you may only get one beer and if your lucky two (small can of Budwiser). it's very very basic. You can tell the bed sheets are a good few years old. I wouldn't stay there again if i am honest.
1	Great place to stay, especially if you will be here a while or are traveling with family.. We had a 15 night stay and this was perfect. There was great restaurants nearby and the kitchenette is great to make things in your room and save on meals. The staff was very accomodating and supported any requests that we made. PArticularly when we needed an extra night and they were oversold. Aric was a gem constantly checking on how we were doing when he saw us on the property and assisting with some printing needs when the lobby printer was tied up and I needed to get some things mailed ASAP. I definately recommend this hotel if you are going to Disney or looking to attend an Angels game.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you so much for your wonderful review. I am so glad to hear that we were able to accommodate you and your family.Hope to see you again on your next trip to Anaheim.Hospitably,Greg WilliamsGeneral Manager
1	Enjoyed our stay. My wife and I spent several days at the RAMH, we came to Atlanta for a long weekend to visit with family. The hotel itself was a great location, the rooms were very nice, roomy and well appointed, the staff was very nice and helpful, the only issues I can point were 1) loud construction happening morning to night while we were there, 2) the pools were a big disappointment, especially the outdoor pool. Overall though we would recommend this hotel.Thank you for the feedback, we really appreciate it. I am sorry that the noise from the improvements to our restaurant disturbed you, please know that the work is done! I hope to see you back very soon!
1	Enjoyed our time here.. I think it has been said previously if you are expecting a Hilton at this price, you'll be disappointed. Overall this is a very good property to stay at. The beds were very comfortable, the rooms stayed cool when using the air conditioner. We stayed a total of six nights here, five at the beginning of our trip, then checked out and went up to Disney for five days, then back for one night before flying out the next day. We were happy with the kids suite with the bunk beds. The bunk beds were a little squeaky going up and down, and while the child settled down trying to go to sleep, but nothing that kept anyone awake. The top floor was great for that length of stay, didn't have to worry about ceiling noise that way. The first night I didn't leave the fan on the air conditioner and heard the highway noise come through in the morning and thought a window was open. Turns out the door isn't completely sealed and noise comes through so leave the fan on (it kept the room nicer to sleep anyway). If you are a really light sleeper and can't have the fan on, you might not enjoy this place. The breakfast was really, really good. One of the best setups I have seen. Don't doddle getting down there as they are good at keeping everything nicely filled till about 9:10. Since the breakfast ends at 9:30 on weekdays, the doors are closed at 9:30. If you go down there at 9:25, get everything you need before going to sit down because you won't have a chance to refill because it CLOSES AT 9:30 PEOPLE. At least 4 days we were sitting on the patio waiting for out slowpoke eater to finish and people are getting mad at the girls trying to close the doors and clean up the breakfast because THEY weren't finished eating. Get up and get down there in time and don't bh at the girls doing their job.The kids really enjoyed the pool, we only had time to use it twice but they had a good time. I would have liked to use the hot tub but it was not working while we were there. It was a good week for us, the pool wasn't too busy and was quiet by 10:00. Thank you for adding to our great San Diego/Disney trip, we had a great time.
1	the best place to stay. we loved this place, we spent 4 nights had a one bedroom suite with small kitchenmicrowave and frig. Our room had a beautiful view of the ocean, great walking area.The Hotel staff was wonderful, very helpful.Breakfast was included and was very goodfree water in the room, free coffee in the office along with fruit or cookies, free wififree parking!

1	Great location, quiet, boutique hotel. I have stayed at the Whitney many times for business, back when it was a Wyndham property and now that it is a New Orleans Collection Hotel. Staff is friendly and efficient, rooms are clean. At some point soon they will need to address carpet as it is getting dated, but OK now. Bar downstairs is good as is restaurant. We ate breakfast a couple of times at Cafe on the Square around the corner and had good experiences.Thank you for your continued patronage at the Whitney Hotel. We are in the planning stages now for replacing carpet throughout the hotel. Thank you again and we look forward to hosting your next visit to New Orleans!Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
1	Great stay, Great city. My first time visiting the city, and I am so glad I chose this hotel. I was in town for a marathon the city was hosting. I arrived a few days early so that I could tour the city as well as rest a bit. As with any walking friendly city, location is so important. Trust me, It was centrally located. In one day, I walked to the CenturyLink Field event center for the expo, visited the market, the needle, and hopped aboard a ferry. Upon my return, I had the choice of a relaxing bath in a spacious tub or a quick shower. Definitely after the marathon, that tub came in handy!!! I was able to sleep comfortably every night which was very important for my mindset. Every evening I would return to a clean room with everything I had requested. Housekeeping was very attentive. Also, there's a Starbucks inside the hotel as well as a place that makes hot sandwiches which came in very handy for my last minute carb fix. If ever in Seattle again, I'm staying here!!Thank you for your comments. We're so happy that you enjoyed your stay and were able to take advantage of all the amenities to prep and decompress from your marathon. It's wonderful that you were also able to explore the city and even get on the water while you were here! We would love to have you back with us during your next visit to Seattle.Best Regards,Sarah S.Guest Relations Manager
0	Disney Vacation. The hotel is lovely looking from the outside, the grounds are beautiful but the rooms are dated, dark! We had a Jr. Suite with hopes of having a place we could relax in. The suite was not inviting. The bus transportation to the parks was not always as described (leaving every 20 min) three of the days was good ... More
1	Perfect deal. Needed to be close to family at a reasons price. Hyatt was perfect for that. I wish the bathroom was a little bit bigger. And I wish the fridge was a little bit colder. Other than those two things, my room was perfect. One elevator was out but it didn't make much difference. Rode the elevator alone most of the time. Didn't seem too crowded in there. There's always someone at the lobby desk with a smile. In the middle of the night, you wouldn't expect that but all the staff I met were super nice and accommodating. I'd stay here again for sure.
1	GREAT Choice!!. The staff was soooo friendly and helpful! It really does make all the difference. We loved the location in the Garden District surrounded by beautiful New Orleans style homes and away from all the noise of the French Quarter. The trolley was just out the front door so it was easy to get around.Breakfast was unusually good with a very nice assortment and they even had grab-and-go bags for guests in a hurry. Make-your-own waffles, eggs, sausage, oatmeal, cereals, juice, fruit, yogurt........The beds was really comfortable and there were lots of extra pillows. Nice bathroom toiletries including mouthwash in addition to the basics. We had a refrigerator and microwave plus coffee maker and supplies. There was even a ceiling fan!There was an outdoor terrace for breakfast if you preferred and next door was a very good Mexican restaurant with excellent margaritas! Free parking - which is a true luxury in NOLA.I was so pleased with my choice and I definitely recommend the hotel.Lili,Thank you for reviewing your stay. It sounds like y'all really enjoyed New Orleans and your stay with us! Our breakfast is one of my favorite things about the hotel. It has something for everyone! We will see you the next time you make it to New Orleans!Kathleen Davis, Front Office Manager
0	Very disappointing. I love the Homewood brand but this visit at this location was extremely disappointing. The breakfast and evening social food was terrible. The room assignment was also unsatisfactory in spite of repeated requests to change rooms. Incessant beeping in room upon arrival turned out to be the dishwasher....really
1	Respite in the Heart of the Action. A hip vibe and soothing lounge music greet you at this fairly new, white-clad, 36-room property located steps from Duval Street, the main drag in Key West. Staff seem a bit over-taxed at times but they bend over backward to assist with everything from meals, room service, taxis, and logistics. Service was excellent, starting with the smiling assistance of bellman Gustavo, who is helpful, not to mention easy on the eyes. Rooms are simply decorated in a modern white motif with blue accents. Blue lighting predominates on the exterior, too. Many of the rooms open with balconies and patios to a lap-style pool crowned by a waterfall and Buddha at one end. Careful - they do have some rooms accurately billed as petite that would be cramped for a couple. My Superior King was spacious enough and comfortable, and was part of the new remodel/construction. You may want to request a newer room. The location cannot be beat. It sits in a relatively quiet block of the otherwise clamorous Duval Street. Through a side gate you step right onto Duval. Go left and hit all the iconic bars from Hemingway days. Go right and there are more of the same, including all of the gay bars and clubs that are only 4 to 6 blocks away. I walked to the marina for several excursions, to the southernmost point and south beaches. The hotel has bikes available at no charge. I only needed a taxi to get to the airport and far-off marinas for some of my excursions. Overall, this property served me well. Its common spaces are chic and modern, the rooms are comfortable, and the people working there make things as easy as possible.Thank you so much for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your stay with us. We are thrilled to hear that you enjoyed your time and the amenities of our property! We will be sure to pass along all of your kind words to our employees so that they know their hard work is appreciated. Please, come back and see us!
1	Alcatraz experience without going to the Alcatraz. If you want to simulate what your life would be like if you were captured by a band of terrorists and the room you would get, then you cannot beat this hostel. The front desk and kitchen/common area are clean and staffs are helpful and courteous. The elevator is kinda old and interesting too, be sure to check that out. You can also meet fellow inmates whom you can make friends.Rooms and stairway are small, squeaky and smelly, and lights works half of the time, just as in horror movies. Washroom have no toilet paper and toilet may lack flushing lever/button. If you are lucky you can find one that had both but have no lightbulb so you must take a dump in the dark. Shared shower for men have plenty of hairs and body tissues, with not a drop of running water...maybe the shared shower for females had better luck.In term of value then I would still recommend this hostel, because front desk services are good, and that you should not whine about living experience when you pay below average in SF.
0	Very Disappointed. The room was tiny and there was nowhere to sit in the room except for the beds and 2 small chairs. One chair had a cigarette burn on it and the other chair had a stain that looked like skid marks. The sheets were clean and the mattress had good protective pad. The weekend breakfast was what you would find... More
0	Not Heather Accessible. The guest service informed me that my service dog would not be able to stay in the handicap accessible room with me. He offered me a pet friendly room, but it was not accessible. (I use a wheelchair so this was an unreasonable option!) He finally contacted a supervisor, who ok'd staying in the accessible room with my dog. Upon entering the room, the room was very tight. It was nearly impossible to maneuver past the bed. As a matter of fact, I didn't. In the bathroom, the toilet sat on the middle of the wall, nothing as far as grab bars. For a customer with balance issues, this makes it hard to toilet independently. It was frustrating that the room is considered to be accessible! I would be happy to consult with you to ensure that rooms are made accessible!
1	Amazingly fun!. My wife and I stopped in Ballard on our way home from Anchorage and stayed at the Ballard Inn. Everything about this place was excellent! The staff was amazing and very, very friendly! Our flight was pushed back so we ended up arriving in Seattle at 7 in the morning. They accommodated us and had our room ready at 9 am so that we could check in early and get some sleep before starting our day. The room was very clean, quaint, and cozy. We didn't hear another guest at all. It did get a little loud on Friday night, but it is a popular area with many bars and restaurants so it was to be expected. Ear plugs were provided and there was really no problems. We loved our stay here! We definitely will stay here again!
1	Great but. I will go back in the future because the rooms are comfortable, great staff and they have a good breakfast and happy hour with nibbles.They also allow pets. But what they also allow is huge numbers of children running around and in the pool in the evening,.not conducive to a relax dip or time in the hot tub. I wish they would put a time limit and age limit after a certain time.Thank you for staying with us and for your positive feedback regarding our breakfast, evening Kickback, rooms and pet policy. There are times when we have activities in the city that bring young adult groups to the hotel and it sounds like this may have been the case during your visit. We staff up for these times to try and anticipate issues like noise or multiple groups in the same area. If you should ever encounter this type of situation during your stay, please contact the manager on duty who will do everything possible to ensure all guests enjoy their visit. If you would like to discuss further, please feel free to call the hotel directly. Thanks again for your feedback and we hope you will stay with us again!Larry L.General Manager
1	Best. SF Hotel. Evah.. My sweety and I had visited San Francisco for an overnight trip and decided since I found a shockingly great price for this hotel and knew the neighbourhood, I figured this had to be good.. Understatement! The Hotel Abri was a stellar hotel staff is always glad to see you, hotel is kept in immaculate condition, bed was worthy of taking home if it were possible, and L'Occitane toiletries were teh OMGz.. Ginormous flat-screen TV also came with a connection for your laptop so you can use it as a monitor, clock radio also had an iPod dock attached. The only negative out of the entire stay (which the Abri can't really help) was facing another hotel I've visited previously which had a new club open up. And when you have late night clubs in a big city, you also get an occasional drunk being asked to leave said club for acting royally ASBO. Other than that, I'd recommend the Abri if you're looking to splurge a bit for a hotel not far from Powell Market, a major transit hub and terminus for the Cable Cars just a couple blocks away..
1	Inn at the Vines, Napa, CA. Very nicely appointed small room, but acceptable lodging for the price when spending the day away from the Motel wine tasting. Very small outdoor swimming pool (probably smallest out door pool have ever seen -- even smaller than indoor pool at Best Western Plus in Albany, Oregon -- another guest had stayed many times at this Motel for business, and commented he had never seen anyone in the pool. But, when there to dine and visit wineries without children, swimming pool irrelevant. But families with children who want to play in the pool, or adults that want to swim some laps be advised that this is not the Motel swimming pool for you. Good, adequate complimentary breakfast (2 choices) with coffee or tea at Denny's next door. Had not experienced this arrangement before, and was certainly nicer and more convenient than the 5.00 credit given by Adelaide Inn in Paso Robles, CA, at expensive for breakfast restaurant located two blocks away from Motel.Thank you for your review. Yes our pool is on the small side, but we have a large area to lounge and soak up the sun. We are glad you enjoyed our arrangement with Denny's for our rewards members.
1	Wonderful staff and location!. My husband and I really enjoyed our stay here! It is mostly an average hotel, even a little run down in areas. BUT the incredible service (particularly from the Valet Parking staff) and close proximity to the Inner Harbor totally made up for all that. Highly recommend using their Valet service, the guys were very helpful and accommodating...they even let us keep our car there after we checked out and locked our luggage in the storage room at no extra charge! Not sure if this is part of their regular service, but we were sure happy with the arrangement! The beds were soft and super comfy, room was clean and relatively quiet from downtown noise, showers were hot with good pressure and breakfast the next day was decent. A solid choice for anyone on a budget wanting to be close to downtown!
1	Great lobby, standard room a bit small. The lobby is really nice, letting you revive the 1920's atmosphere. Unfortunately, the room we had was a bit smaller as expected, in particular with respect to the hotel's category.Complementary coffee in the morning and champagne in the evenings are a very nice offer. Take the occasion to enjoy the lobby's atmosphereThanks for taking time to enhance our online reputation! We're delighted to see you were able to bask in the opulence of our lobby and take advantage of our nightly social hour. The rooms are a bit cozy, which is what you get in a historic 1920's building along with the charm! Thanks again and we hope to see you again in the future!Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager
1	Good ol' classic!. Travelled with my partner to Seattle for the first time in July 2013, and after researching around on Tripadvisor and compare notes with other websites, we decided to pick Sorrento Hotel. And we did not regret it! :)It set a good start for our Seattle trip - we arrived a few hours earlier than the usual check-in time, and when we approached the reception to check-in, we were told we can do so right away - that put a HUGE smile on our face, since we've been up since 5am to catch our flight and we were totally worn out! Excellent customer service!This is an updated classic semi-luxurious hotel - I personally love the building, the hotel classic decor and settings, the room is updated and yet classy, clean, spacious and unlike other old hotels, it does not have that 'moldy' carpet smell. The room comes with your own freshly ground coffee and french-press.:)The location is great - within walking distance to literally everywhere. We walked to a whole lot of places, i.e. Pike Market, Capitol Hill, etc... we even walked all the way to the Space Needle!There's a li'l bar inside the hotel and I did enjoy a couple cocktails there. There's also a bar across the street called Quarter Lounge, check it out. And if you need pharmacy or coffee fix, they are all along the Main St right outside the hotel. Very convenient.Hope this helps. :)Wow! Thank you for such a great review.So glad you enjoyed your stay! Hope to see you again soon.Randall ObrechtGeneral ManagerSorrento Hotel
1	more for your money!!!!!. I am sitting in my room at the Suncoast as I write this reveiw to you, via high speed internet service provided by the hotel at a 9.99 fee. ( a bargin since I probably saved 100 over the 24 hour period, by using my computer instead of gambling!!)Trip advisor is my travelers bible. I was surprised at any negative comments about the Suncoast, but most were positve witch steered me to give it a try.We checked in Monday, Sept. 26 and will depart today Sept. 28.Since it is off season and during the week, we may have not experienced the heavey smoke ,bad service or disgrundled staff some have written about.The rooms are huge, bathrooms gigantic, and the beds are heavenly.(must be a coast hotel trait, Barbary coast has same beds)We booked through trip reservations , paid 44 a night, received a coupon book upon arrival that had a free luch buffet and other offers.The buffet was wonderful.We have stayed on the strip, done all the fancy dancy hotels and wanted to try someplace the locals recommended that had all the amenities we wanted for a decent price. We found it right here.This is video poker heaven!We ordered the American Casino Guideoff the internet which was filled with valuable gambling information and 2 for one coupons for rooms and food, and gamming. We used Suncoast coupons, and had a fabulous dinner buffet (Tues Filet Mingion ,Prime Rib Seafood etc) , 2 for 1 , saved 15., at the Rampart nex door.We are going to use a coupon and stay at the Las Vegas Club downtown on fremont street when we leave here. 49 for both nights or 59 for newer tower rooms.Another valuable sight is Cheapo Las vegas , which will critic everything down to the buffets in Vegas. Along with Trip Advisor, and American Casino guide ,our trip is just costing us mostly gambling expense.We are looking forward to trying the other Coast hotels because our experiences so far have been positive.So to some it up, if you want to get away from the strip, want a great place to stay, want to take in a movie (18 screen movie theater), comfy beds,decent price, high speed internet, perfect size workout room, great air conditioning, good food at great prices and on and on this is the place for you!Hope you have as much fun as we have had!!!
1	In Memory of ....... This hotel has changed a bit in the lobby since that day in July 1981 when the skywalks collapsed, killing 114 people and injuring others.I was working at The Kansas City Star then and remember that disaster very well. The newspaper won a Pulitzer Prize for its coverage of the Hyatt and the aftermath.I think it would be appropriate and in good taste for there to be a small plaque in the lobby noting the deaths and injuries of so many people and how building design has changed since.Today, the lobby looks quite safe, and I am sure it is. The Hyatt Regency disaster has gone down as one that has raised building safety to a much higher standard.
0	Wedding Road trip. We had an amazing road trip, after getting married in Las Vegas, ending in San Francisco. This hotel however was the biggest disappointment of our trip. We had booked the Hilton, but then found this at half the cost decided to book it so we could spend our money on other things. We wished we'd stuck with the Hilton. I'm not normally one for writing a bad review (in fact it's my 1st I feel like I'm being mean!) it wasn't really that bad, it just wasn't the best one on our trip. We'd booked a cheaper one in Morro Bay, (we wanted to experience a Motel) which knocked the socks of this hotel for both room service!Before we arrived we had emailed the hotel to let them know we had just got married, to ask if they had any upgrades. They kindly offered us 2 options: a free upgrade to a garden view or a paid one into a front facing harbour view. We said yes to the paid one, as it was our honeymoon after all. When we arrived at the hotel, the guy on reception had no details about it at all. When we asked about it he said we would have to speak to the manager in the morning and see if there were any free the next day. We were disappointed to say the least, especially as we had the email with the confirmation. We didn't bother speaking to the manager the next day, we were only there for 2 nights didn't want to spend the time moaning:) So we just took the room they had. It was ok. We found out it was the garden view (overlooking 3 palm trees:)). It was clean did the job. Breakfast was not great. Greasy food most of it looked unhygienic. So I didn't bother. My husband ate the bagels. Before we went out for the day I asked reception about a group of seals we had heard about by the harbour where we were likely to find them. He basically laughed at me and said 'you'll just hear them, they are everywhere'. Thought it was a bit rude. As it turns out we saw hundreds all the way up highway 1, quite an experience for us coming from the UK. If you just want a cheaper option for a pit stop, it will do the job. It was clean after all. If you want somewhere nicer, book the Hilton.
1	Great hotel! Location...hmmm.. depends on what youre there for.. The hotel is great, very nice rooms and a great view. The neighborhood is quiet, you can walk on the park thats across the street. If you are there for a meeting, event or convention, its even better since hte hotel, as the name says, has its own convention center and you dont even have to go outside! Perfect for when its freezing outside!But if you are going on vacation, I wouldnt recomend this location since its far away from downtown and from most of the turistic places.Thank you so much for the review, I appreciate it!
0	Weekly traveler. Was really excited to stay in a historical hotel. Got in very late and requested a very quite room. Was informed that there would be no one at the front desk after 11:00. Got in my room and settled in, noticed toothpaste in the sink, hair on the floor and in the tub but of course by this time there was no one at the front desk..Turned the TV off and went to bed but the music from the nightclub kept me awake until they closed at 2:am. I will never stay there again! Very disappointed!!
1	Good stay for the money. Overall very good stay..staff was very friendly. We at first were given a room without a fridge and microwave which we had booked. The front desk employee quickly changed our room and apologized immediately. Breakfast is from 630-10 and it's a great spread. The chef comes out to ask how everyone is doing and ensures the sterno and food supplies are fully stocked. Hot food, cereals, muffins,bagels,yogurt,fruit,pancake maker,burrito bar you name it they had it. Didn't feel rushed at all. We were 15 away from the city area and it's close to the highway which was convienient. Room was good but walls need to be insulated you can hear everything in the next room. Housekeeping was good. Pool wasn't open but that wasn't a major issue for us. Plenty of parking. Overall good stay we would come back.
0	bad dream. room to small, smelly beds are to small front desk people to blunt, poor breakfast for the price that i Payed 217US before tax i found a small insect in the bathroom very tiny bathroom, very tiny place overall for the price that i PayedDear Gianfranco N, We are apologizing again in regards to your experience at our property.Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you gave us to implement improvements to ensure we offer a better experience for guests in the future.Thank you.Y Chen General ManagerBest Western Cabrillo Garden Inn
1	Great hotel in great location. Couldn't have asked for more from a city centre hotel - ten paces from China Town - opposite is a good Irish pub - hop on hop off bus stop across the road - French restaurant over the street.Realy GREAT staff - super value- valet parking at 42 per day - nice rooms Thank you for the great review we truly appreciate you taking the time to share your experience. I am happy to hear you enjoyed the property and location. I enjoy the Irish Bank as well, for a warm shepherds pie and a cool beverage after work. The hop on hop off bus is an excellent way to tour the city. It is nice to be able to get off in the neighborhoods you would like to explore more thoroughly. I am glad to read you were able to take advantage of this feature during your San Francisco expedition.Cheers,Quinn McEnteeFront Office Manager
1	Great concept... great service... noisy location.. I personally loved the attention that went into designing this space - and the folks that work there are great! I can see why it gets such good ratings! It has a lot of appeal due to the access to fun areas around San Diego. The price is right, too!There was a drawback to the location that my husband states will be the reason we won't go back. The road noise and traffic on Rosecrans forced us to seek out ear plugs and the only way to watch TV was on a high volume. We didn't feel 100 safe walking to and from coffee shops, etc. In fact, someone leaving a driveway paid no attention to us at all. Everyone on Rosecrans is in some kind of hurry. Not the laid back beach town vibe I was looking for.If you are young and hip enough to pass out with a buzz after the fun bar and pool experience, the road noise may not be a bother.Thank you for taking the time to write a review. Happy to hear you enjoyed our little gem. Unfortunately, some of our rooms do get the road noise, but we always recommend requesting one of our quieter rooms, so that you may have a peaceful night OR there is always your great suggestion of a nitecap or two in our bar :) Thanks again for taking the time to write a review.
0	Absolutely avoid this place. The carpet was filthy,tub didn't drain,area around the breeze ways is very trashy, they give you 2 towels for 2 beds and refuse to give more no matter how long you are there, refuse to refund monies if you want to go to different hotel, the swimming pool looks like a cess pool. Walls were nasty, I just really can't... More
1	2 day stay in San Diego (2 different hotels to try)- 2nd night here at Ocean Park Inn. I come to San Diego several times a year. This time wanted to try 2 different hotels. Stayed June 21, 2016, Room 319. The check in and check out was a breeze. Everyone I came in contact was very professional and helpful. This stay was a partial ocean view, 2 QN room. I highly recommend if you could afford it, stay in a full ocean view. The partial ocean view means you will be assigned a room on either side of the hotel. From the patio you do get a slight view if you turn one of the chairs and put it right in the corner. If sitting on the other chair you will not be able to see the ocean. Again, did I say it is just a slight ocean view. Being on the side of the hotel it was harder to hear the ocean waves. I would bet that the full ocean view rooms you would definitely hear the waves as these rooms face the boardwalk and beyond that the beach. The patio has 2 chairs and a small end table. It is nice to be able to hang up wet clothes. You can leave your patio door open to feel the nice ocean breeze. I would highly recommend the higher floors so that you can leave your patio door open all night and be secure. As others have commented, this facility is no resort but it is not a motel either. It is perfect for a get away to the beach. The room is modern enough, the beds were comfortable, and a really nice big tiled bathroom. The vanity is inside the bathroom. The shower didn't have the best pressure but it was decent. The shower is big and enclosed in glass. The bathroom has huge thick beach towels to use. Yes the decor in the hallways and the carpet is very outdated but not old or shaggy. The carpet in the room was ok. There is a small fridge to put drinks in. All in all, the room is very comfortable. There is a continental breakfast. (Standard waffle making, oatmeal, cereals, muffins, danishes, yogurts, fruit, hard boiled eggs, and drinks.) There is plenty of room to sit at a table. It was great for us, all the food constantly being restocked. The pool and hot tub were heated and great. Nice relaxing area with lots of pool chairs. What I liked as well is that you can go out the back of the hotel straight to the beach access. In fact, it's just across the boardwalk. There is a life guard station right there. After you day on the sand you can wash off at an outside shower at the hotel. This is so perfectly convenient to wash off the sand from your feet, clothes, and beach toys. Having a room/hotel so close is so convenient for potty breaks if you have kids. You don't have to walk a long distance to find a bathroom. It's just right up to your room. The underground parking was nice as this whole area is always crowded and parking hard to find. There is a price for the parking which all San Diego hotels seem to charge. It is underground and didn't have any problems finding space. You are close to the elevator and can lug all your suitcases easily. There is a Ralph's grocery store and lots of restaurants (fast food and fine dining) within walking distance. So everything is close by. You will need a car if going to Balboa Park, Old Town, etc. I love how practical this place was to bring kids and just had a good time. I will be coning again. Just wished it wasn't so expensive.We really appreciate you taking the time to provide us with this all of this feedback. We are happy to hear that you enjoyed the view and overall had a good time with your stay. Thank you for letting us know some areas of opportunity for us to work on, we are always striving to do better and we will take these suggestions very seriously. We hope to welcome you back again soon!
1	Lovely boutique hotel. Myself, my partner and her father, stayed in a King Suite in March. The room itself was lovely- spacious, modern, funky looking room. The main bed was huge, and comfortable. There was also a pull down bed, which we used, which was again a decent size, and comfy. We also had a large table and chairs in the room- its surprising how nice it is to have somewhere to sit other than a bed whilst staying in a hotel,The location was perfect- very close to the Bart, and cablecars and Union square. A couple of nice diners very nearby for breakfast too. Would highly recommend, based on our stay. There was also 2 hours of free saki (5-7pm) everyday- we only tried this once, on our way out, but its still a nice touch to have.The only real downside, was that there was a lot of street noise, and it appeared to be an old hotel done out, but the windows were still the old orignal ones- so didnt keep much of the noise out at all- I would suggest taking earplugs! we were woken around 6am most mornings.
1	Great location - friendly helpful staff. The location of this hotel is great - within easy walking distance of lots of dining options (including Reading Terminal Market, Panera, Starbucks, etc.) also walk-able to historical sites and sightseeing locations. The staff is super friendly and helpful. The downsides were room size (small and bathroom painfully small!), lack of outlets for charging, and questionable housekeeping/cleaning. If the indoor pool is a draw - do not book here for that! The pool is small and really dirty. It seems that residents book on weekends to let the kids use the pool. It was really loud with kids running and jumping into a 3 ft pool and hot tub. Disappointing if you are traveling with kids who are looking forward to some pool time on vacation.Thank you for staying at the Courtyard Philadelphia Downtown and for taking the time to share your feedback. We are extremely proud that our staff were able to make your stay an enjoyable one. It's also nice to know our convenient location and closeness to the Historic District, with many restaurants and shopping venues close by, made your stay even better. Please accept my apology for the housekeeping issues you encountered during your visit. Our staff is passionate about providing guests with the cleanest facilities, so we are checking into the situation now to see where we failed. We are committed to providing you with the best accommodations and service. I sincerely hope you will give us another chance to prove it to you on a future stay.Thank you, David KiddAssistant General Manager
1	Old World Elegance, New World Charm. I'm a classic girl. When I travel, I usually stay in private clubs or five-star hotels, and studiously avoid the trendy. A friend raved about the Sorrento, which I'd heard about via its intriguing cultural programming and Night School series, and when some us suggested a weekend to meet up there, I thought I'd give it a go. More than anything, it reminded me of the hotels I like in Europe, the sort of family-owned, off-the-beaten-path but always in the best locations kind of places one only ever discovers through word of mouth. Well here's a little secret for you: in Seattle, stay at the Sorrento. There's even a charming little book in the room detailing its history, as a Belle Epoque refuge in a tranquil setting that became the place to take an apartment for wealthy local families during the Roaring '20s. Much of this enchanted ambiance remains. Highlights I enjoyed dinner in the Hunt Club, and the perfect cappuccino with the paper at breakfast the next day, a glass of wine by the fire in the main lounge, with its echoes of Timberline Lodge on Mount Hood, another of my favorites in the region (without the high-altitude dizziness here), curling up on six pillows on my bed to read in blissful silence with a view of a gargoyle standing guard on the roof outside, making a very civilized cup of tea in my room with Theo Chocolates from the well-stocked minibar... the list of memorable perfect touches goes on and on... I would encourage you to check in to the Sorrento and make your own. A perfect ten in my book it gets its own chapter.
0	ok for what you paid. Even though its non smoking rooms, first room had an odor. They changed rooms..odor was not as bad. Bed was not comfortable.
0	Worst place I've every stayed in. I've stayed in many budget hotels over the last 20 years including other Motel 6 motels. Half the lights did not work in the room, the room was dirty and the elevator did not work. I was there on business and they tried to double the price of the room from the confirmed reservations price that I had in writing. One light bulb in the entire room was working and the room smelled of urine and dog.Dear Guest, Thank you for sharing your post. Motel 6 standards for quality rest on our promise to offer the lowest price of any national chain by delivering the essential elements of a comfortable room for a satisfying stay, for this reason we apologize for the disappointment you describe with the expectations of our housekeeping cleaning of the guestroom. We encourage you to contact our Guest Relations at 1-855-787-9864 to record the details of your stay to help us provide a better guest experience in the future.
1	Excellent !. We stayed there overnight between flights from Jamaica to Salt Lake City. The only bad thing about our stay is we got in at midnight and left the following morning, we did not get a chance to enjoy the room. Service was excellent, from pick up at airport, front desk, and shuttle back to airport. Our room was a two room suite with a Tv in the bedroom and a flat screen Hidef in the living room. Nice size refrigorator and micro wave. Since we got in so late , we did not take advantage of them. Would stay again for a longer period of time. Wi-fi was at an extra cost in the room, but the computer in the lobby allowed us internet to print our boarding passes.
1	100 Satisfied. My wife and I stayed at the Hampton Inn Philadelphia International Airport prior to taking a flight. We arrived in the evening and were departing early the next morning. We checked in online and were greeted very nicely by the staff. The informed us of the complimentary breakfast in the morning and other amenities that they offered. There was complimentary Wifi in the room which was great as we were able to check in for our flight and browse the web. The room was very clean as was the bathroom. That evening they even had complimentary cookies in the lobby. I would highly recommend this hotel. We only stayed at the hotel for a short time, but I wish i was able spend more time to take advantage of the entire experience.Thank you for your kind words and feedback in regards to your recent stay at the Hampton Inn Philadelphia Airport. We look forward to serving you again soon if your travels should bring you back to Philadelphia.Director of Sales
1	Very Comfortable and great staff!. Spent 3 nights in the Garden Cottage with wife and two college age kids. Rooms was VERY nice and comfortable for the four of us. The common areas were extremely clean and the view from observation deck thingy was truly amazing. The staff was awesome in every possible way. We utilized one of the garages across the street and a word of warning they are small (had a full size rental and it just fit--don't plan on parking your full size SUV there and it is doubtful that a mid-size would fit). Breakfast was plentiful and the fruits, eggs... were very good, a disappointment though were the baked goods, although good they were not home made . Please understand they were very good, but when I stay in a BnB I don't expect store bought. Two other minor complaints, guests on their cell phones in the BF room and common areas, I was also working but i limited my cell phone usage to our rooms and outside lastly the dog. We are all dog lovers but not sure how appropriate it is to have the dog sitting on the chairs. Again overall a great experience and would most likely stay there again but need to call it as I see it.
1	HGI ORLAND AIRPORT. I ended up here unexpectedly. I made my reservation in the care on my way to the airport for an unexpected lay over in Orlando to catch an early morning flight out to Aruba. Rates were reasonable and the booking process on my phone was a breeze. I also used the digital check in and picked my room. The hotel was clean, front desk was welcoming on check in and out. Prompt shuttle pickup and delivery to and from airport. Restaurant was good, staff was friendly and helpful. Beer was cold and the food was better than you might expect in a hotel restaurant. Cookies in lobby are always a bonus as is the flavored water. Trusted brand all the way around.Thank you for being loyal towards our brand and choosing to stay at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport. We are thrilled to know our location close to the airport was convenient for your needs and that our service, as well as facilities, were up to your liking. I will definitely share your feedback with my entire team and thank them for a job well done. We look forward to the opportunity to welcome you back soon! Sincerely,Michael GoldwasserGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport
1	Quick but Great Stay. The location is great very close to the airport and had a complimentary shuttle. Also the area is very safe with lots of restaurants and shopping nearby. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. The rooms are very spacious and clean. The bathroom was a bit tight, but was not a bother. Unfortunately I had an early flight, so I could not take advantage of breakfast. As a Hilton Honors Gold member and frequent traveler I would recommend this hotel.Dale, thank you on behalf of the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport team for your kind comments on our performance, and we're glad to know how loyal you are towards our Brand! As there are so many options for accommodations around the Orlando Airport area, we appreciate that you chose to stay with us. We have shared your wonderful comments with the team, and they were most encouraged by your praise for a job well done. Thanks again for highlighting our convenient location. We look forward to the opportunity to welcome you back and provide you with outstanding service once again.Sincerely,Michael GoldwasserGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport
0	not worth more than 65/night. Overall, stay here if you are paying 65 or less...else keep looking..definitely not worth a penny more.Stayed the weekend of Feb 13th and due to the high demand for rooms that weekend, this Rodeway Inn was charging 150/night (including taxes, etc)...a complete ripoff. I used priceline and will ensure to pick a higher category of hotels next time around, especially since 150 is insane to charge for this property no matter what supply/demand looks like. First of all, we were given a room on the side of the highway. This is completely fine if you keep the a/c on because that will drown out some of the noise. However, when we walked in the room, it smelled (stale smoke). We immediately called the front desk and asked for another room or to come and spray something. They said there are no rooms available and that they have no febreeze. You'd think that if you're doubling the hotel price for a particular weekend, you would step up service at least a bit. We received no follow up call from the manager the next day nor did the front desk staff attempt to spray anything to remove the foul odor. We next walked into the bathroom and noticed that the towel was stained with dirt. The good thing was that there were extra towels but I don't get what kind of quality control exists at the hotel if you cannot ensure clean towels. Further, the tv was horrible. They list all these channels on their guide however, they subscribe to none of them. Why false advertise to your customers.Again, the price we were charged for this hotel was obscene, especially when a real hotel was charging 20 - 30 more. I have nobody to blame but myself for booking this hotel however the review stands given the fact that I did not receive the services I paid for.
0	Not bad, but strange.. The public areas of this property are relatively well maintained, and the staff there are friendly and efficient. Oddities: 1. The layout of the room--The beds were very close to the door, so it was impossible to ignore the noise in the hallway that went on all night. 2. Housekeepers expected to clean the room while we were in it. 3. Hotel staff knocked on the door at 10pm, and insisted on entering the room to exchange a new phone book for the old one in the room, even though we told them the children were sleeping. Very strange.
1	Probably the nicest hotel this grad student will ever stay in. My friend and I spent 6 nights at the Hotel Rex while attending a conference at the Moscone Center, and it is by far the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in. It's basically how I envision my fantasy home: literary references everywhere, warm and eclectic colour scheme, coffee every morning and wine (one glass free for guests!) every evening, and live jazz music once a week. I am in love with this place. The location is wonderful, too, just a few blocks from Union Square and 15 minutes walk to the conference centre. I do have to say thank goodness for conference rates, because as lovely as the Rex is, I still can't imagine paying 360/night for a hotel (but I'm a poor grad student, so take that as you will).

0	Run Down. My room was clean but everything was run down. The carpet was ripped and coming up near the door and the bedding looked like it came from the 70s. The only good thing was the new flat screen TV. My stay was ok but I would not stay there again the area isn't all that great and I did not feel safe going to my car.
1	Very nice visit - but needs wi-fi throughout. I traveled to Atlanta for a business conference and had the pleasure of staying at JW Marriott Buckhead for 149 night at the conference rate. The hotel was very clean and modern. The room was very big and the king bed I had was extremely comfortable. I had the best night sleep in a month. The staff were efficient and helpful. And the food provided for the conference was very good. The hotel is conveniently located just across the street from MARTA station so it was an easy 35 minute train ride from the airport, which could have not been easier. I paid 6 round-trip from airport. They have a very large pool, large hot tub and even a sauna. Very nice!I rated the hotel as 4 stars for two reasons: 1) Oddly, there wasn't a dresser in the room. Everything had to be hung up on the 8 hangers provided OR or stuffed in the very small nightstand drawer and 2) There is no wi-fi in the rooms. The rooms are supposed to have broadband, but I can't verify this. Others at the conference stated that their laptops couldn't connect using the internet cable in their rooms either.Wi-fi is available in the lobby. I just didn't want to sit in the lobby for any length of time.
1	Out stay at Hilton Garden Inn Orlando. We spent 3 nights at the Hilton Garden Inn. The staff was very helpful as we need to have foam pillows and not feather pillows. The staff immediately made the change to help prevent any more allergic reactions. We also had one experience with a small spot of blood on one sheet. The staff came up immediately, changed the bedding and then gave us a voucher for free breakfast.Thank you for your recent stay at the Hilton Garden Orlando Airport and for sharing your feedback with us. We appreciate you recognizing and commending our staff for providing you with excellent customer service. However, we are sorry for the housekeeping issues you encountered. Nonetheless, we are glad that we were able to resolve the issue immediately to your satisfaction. It was our pleasure to host you and we hope to see you again soon.All the Best, Debra Thompson-French General Manager Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport
1	Hidden Gem at Gateway to Chinatown - Incredible Value!. Gorgeous room, friendly and welcoming staff, immaculately clean, great value, and joyous attention to detail are just a few of the attributes that come to mind about the Orchard Garden Hotel. Our first interaction with the staff started when we popped out of the Montgomery BART Station but were unsure which direction to start walking to get to the hotel. A quick phone call to the front desk put us in touch with a genuinely caring and competent ambassador for the hotel who stayed on the line with us until we were clearly on the right path. Once we arrived (seven hours too early for check in), two friendly and helpful front desk attendants went into action to serve us. They carefully listened to our room preferences and put their play into motion. There were no rooms immediately available, but they credibly assured us they could match us with the perfect room for us. They gave us several great ideas for sights to take in before our room was ready (fantastic suggestions that caused the time to evaporate). When we we returned, WE WERE NOT DISAPPOINTED!Our room exactly matched the criteria we discussed. The room was a contemporary design that was sparkling clean! The sofa was a comfortable place to plop down after eight glorious hours of sightseeing (on foot). San Francisco's sights, vistas, and hills were captivating. The room had so many things that demonstrated careful attention to detail. Examples included: illuminated light switches that are easy to find in the dark, a clock-radio with a built-in iPhone connector AND USB port for charging a headset or watch, and an automatic light that comes on inside the closet when the closet door is opened. We have stayed in several beautiful San Francisco hotels over the years for business. But from here forward, the Orchard Garden Hotel will be our FIRST CHOICE when visiting San Francisco! Thanks to the staff and management for an awesome experience. You have made us customers for life!I'm thrilled that our staff were able to take such good care of you. We know that traveling can be tiring, so we take care of everything for you down to the smallest detail -- I'm glad you appreciated those built in iPhone connectors! We look forward to receiving you and your traveling companions again on your next trip to San Francisco. Safe travels,Collins C., Front Office Manager

I booked this hotel due to believing the 700 hotel nationwide presence can screw up in such a big manner. the sofa pull out couch is filthy broken No utensils in the kuchen AC filter accumulated dust about an inch. Missing one portion of the window a kid can fall out of it AC being not effective The management does not care no body responded to the maintenance call for more the 48 hoursYour review for our hotel was recently brought to my attention. I sincerely apologize that your stay with us did not meet our companys high standards. To ensure that a situation like yours doesn't happen again, I will be making sure we are thoroughly inspecting rooms before guest arrivals. While we no longer keep dishes in guest rooms, these items are available upon request at the front desk. Moving forward, I will make sure we are clearly communicating our amenities. Thank you very much for bringing this to our attention. To discuss further, or if you have any questions, please contact me at PERextendedstay.com. Thank you for choosing Extended Stay Hotels. We hope we have the opportunity to see you again in the future.
0	Damp and Mold. The front desk staff was wonderful and as helpful as can be. This was especially true, when our room had mold on the windows and drapes and smelled of damp. We were immediately moved to the only other available room, which, unfortunately also had mold (this time in bathroom) and damp. It was supposed to be a more expensive room because it overlooked St Charles Street, which under cover of night seems to have lots of inebriated individuals and street pharmacists doing business. We couldn't use the elevator for a short time after the ceiling fell in on another guest and had to be repaired. The bed was comfortable and would have contributed to a good nights sleep except for the damp smell. Both the room we started with and the room we eventually slept in were a bit small for two twin beds and a family of four with teenagers.The staff made sure the rest of our four-night reservation was cancelled and let us keep our car in the secured parking lot while we explored the French Quarter the next day even after we had checked out. They were helpful despite our unpleasant stay due circumstances beyond their control. Because of the helpfulness and friendliness of the front desk staff, I wish that I could give this hotel a higher rating, but as we could not even stay past the first night of our reservation (and then only because it was late and dark and we had no other place to go), I could not recommend this hotel.David,I'm very sorry we did not exceed your expectations during your stay. The issues you encountered have been addressed by housekeeping. We have rooms with two double beds and one king bed. I'm sorry the room with two double beds seemed small for your family. I hope your time in New Orleans was enjoyable and you were able to see a lot while site-seeing after you checked out. We always want to accommodate our guests by letting them their cars with us a little longer!Again, I am very sorry you did not enjoy your stay. I hope you will consider staying with us again, so we can have a chance to provide you with excellent service. Kathleen Davis, Front Office Manager

1	Perfect for our girls getaway!. We were a group of 8 ladies aging from 23 - 64. We checked in on a Friday, the room wasn't quite ready so took the shuttle over to the Marriott World Center for a poolside lunch. My only negative of our stay was that the front desk was suppose to call/text when our room was ready and they didn't. We ate, roamed around World Center for a bit and shuttled back. Once back, we napped in the lobby for nearly an hour before I checked in with the front desk and yes, our room was indeed ready. We had a 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom unit with a living room, dining room and kitchen which was plenty big for our party. Everyone we encountered was more than pleasant and went out of their way to greet us. We used the main pool on a Sunday which was not crowded at all. The store in the main building was complete in their offerings of drinks, snacks, fruit and pre-packaged meals as well as suntan lotions and basic toiletries. The location is perfect for a Disney vacation and a short Uber ride to the Universal Parks. This was our second stay in the Marriott complex and we look forward to our next visit.Welcome back! We are pleased to hear you enjoyed your stay with us here in Orlando. Thank you for taking the time to leave a review. We look forward to your next visit.
1	Good value, clean, good lcoation and parking!!. Having stayed at the sister property the Coventry Motor Inn back in 2014 and enjoying it, we chose this place when looking for affordable accommodations (with parking) in a slightly different area. This time around, we were spending 2 nights in SF at the end of a 3 week roadtrip decided to do one hotel more budget (this one) and then the final night being a bit more of a splurge at another hotel on the Embarcadero.The hotel is easy to find, and we got lucky with a parking space right near to the lobby to check in. The chap was nice and we'd booked a room on the top floor to try and make the best of the limited views this location has - we were a little early but he called through there and then to the housekeeper who was working on our room, and she said it'd be about half an hour, so we had a wander and had a beer and a game of pool in the bar across the street, and were able to check in on returning.The rooms were very similar to the Coventry Inn, in that they are older style, but clean, spacious and comfortable. One added bonus with the Columbus Inn was the small balcony we had in our room - enough to step out on and watch the world go by and with surprising good views of Coit Tower and even a glimpse of the Golden Gate across the rooftops, so I was a happy bunny!We were getting to the end of our stamina on this 4000 odd mile trip, and so opted to order take out to be delivered to the hotel for dinner. It was easy, and after signing up to Grubhub online (with the WiFi being included in the room price) and selecting a place, we called down to let reception know we had a delivery coming and he said they would bring it right up to the room for us - something we're not used to in UK hotels, but very convenient for 2 weary travellers!We were able to eat properly too, as the room has a small dining table and chairs next to the window. Winner! The bathroom is only small, but has a separate vanity/sink area so it was still functional. We slept great in the large comfy bed, and grabbed a yummy breakfast next morning at a cafe in the next street in walking distance, so that was another plus. All in all, i'd recommend this hotel and definitely stay there again. Nice work Columbus!!! :-)
0	dirty, roaches and no clean linens.. I was really looking forward to this hotel. The website made it look pretty cute. I did read the reviews but generally take reviews with a grain of salt do to disgruntled people leaving the majority of them. however I became part of the disgruntled group. there was no cleaning service while we were in the hotel room. We had to ask for new linens and new towels and only received new towels. The Linens had a distinct bleach stain on them that we could identify that they had never been changed. The linens are not fitted sheets they were just tucked in top sheets so by the end of the night we were looking at the disgusting mattress. it's a shame cuz if this hotel was managed properly it would be a gem. located in a prime spot on st-charles right next to a trolley stop and in a very cute historic building. unfortunately the cleanliness or lack thereof was a major turnoff. I specifically chose this hotel because it looked like a mom and pop but quickly learned my lesson. I will be visiting and specifically staying in a corporate Hotel upon our next trip to New Orleans because I know a corporate Hotel will have quality standards. I was overall very disappointed.
1	Randolph Street Gem. This is the 2nd time that I have stayed at Hotel Allegro. The hotel went thru an extensive remodel since the last time that I stayed here. Front Desk Service is 1st rate all the way and the Front Desk Personnel was very courteous and polite. My room was located on the 11th floor facing Randolph Street. The room was decor was to my taste and the bathroom was spotless. If your in Chicago on your visit I highly and strongly recommend this wonderful hotel..We appreciate you taking the time to write this review! Your feedback is truly valued. It's wonderful to see that you've enjoyed your stays with us. Our staff looks forward to welcoming you back in the future!
1	Decent Hotel and Great for the Braves. Stay Report - 5/6 - 5/7Location: The hotel is located on Cumberland Avenue right between I-75 and I-285. It's easy walking distance from the Cobb Energy Center and a mile away from the new Braves Ballpark (Suntrust Park). Nearby is the Cumberland Mall and Akers Mill Square Shopping Center which have a bunch of restaurants and shops. There is no public transit options available. Hotel: The hotel is an older property, a 14 story brick building with a central atrium. There are five elevators which can be a little slow when the hotel is at capacity. The lobby has a restaurant that serves breakfast as well as a separate restaurant and bar which is open until 12 and serves food until then. The second floor has a lot of meeting space which was full when I was there. Check In: The agent checking us in seemed tired and worn out and wasn't overly friendly. I don't blame her though, now that the Braves park is nearby this hotel gets very crowded. She did confirm what credit card we wanted to use as well as if we still wanted two King rooms and a Double room. She even tried to get us all on the same floor which was really nice. Room: My room was a double that was quite nice. The beds were extremely comfortable and the bathroom was of a nice size with a hot shower and Aveda toiletries. There was a small mini fridge and a coffee maker as well. My only complaint was the TV was older and couldn't handle digital channels. Restaurant/Lounge: We had drinks and dessert in the bar which was understaffed and crowded though the cocktails and desserts were quite good. The lounge was of a decent size and comfortable and had a pretty good breakfast spread. Hot oatmeal, grits, bacon, sausage and eggs as well as breads, really good pastries and fruit and cereal.Our rate was 160/night and for a Braves game this is a good hotel.Thank you for the extensive feedback! I am happy to tell you that we are getting new TV's in July / August! They will be 55 and contain all of the latest in entertainment options. Please come back and see us!
0	disgusting. My family and I were at the days inn for 5 days. We had 3 different rooms during this stay. Each room had a different problem. The first room the airconditioner leaked all over the rug. The second room had a leak into the bathroom light. The third room the airconditioner hardly worked at all. Each room was filthy. I seen either dead roaches or live roaches in each room. I know florida has bug problems but the hotel should have an exterminator on the premises. The hotel also needs more cleaning staff. I really was afraid to sit on the toilets and had a hard time sleeping because of the bugs. I have stayed in budget hotels before but this on was the worst. It was also dangerous, due to the plumbing issues. In fact, this hotel just needs to be condemned!
1	Awesome Awful!. This hotel is fantastic in so many ways. Check-in was a breeze as we were warmly welcomed. Upon inspecting our corner room, I saw that it was 2 double beds for our romantic getaway, which was not what I had planned. In a few minutes after calling the front desk, the clerk personally came up to accompany us to the same room 2 floors higher with a king bed--perfect! It was a suite but we have never seen such spacious hotel accommodations. The living room was huge the bedroom oversized as well. The bathroom was tiny, but not a problem. We have a round window that opened from the shower it was fun to open it a crack watch the street below as I showered! However, the street below was a problem overnight because the Sorrento is 2 blocks from the Virginia Mason emergency room entrance where all the ambulances begin end. I was awakened by sirens all night long, this wasn't even over a weekend! That is the only negative aspect of our stay, but it's enough to keep me from going back. We ate in their restaurant which was outstanding. We frequently utilized their free shuttle service to the downtown area. It is also close enough to walk if you have the energy and time and aren't carrying a boatload of shopping bags. We did not need a car while we were there which meant we did not use the valet. The staff was outstanding in every encounter I had with them. The beds were great, the view isn't great, but the windows were large. And the interior of the hotel is just plain gorgeous. The coffee bar is very nice since we love French-pressed coffee there is a small frig in the room as well. I only wish it was in a quieter location. I booked this stay through booking.com and was pleased to find that this did not affect how we were treated at all.Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us. As you mentioned, we are located two blocks from the hospital, but by city ordinance, the ambulances are supposed to turn off their sirens when they are four blocks away. Please know that I will be following up with our local ambulance services about their compliance with this ordinance. Otherwise, I was pleased to see that you enjoyed your experience. We look forward to seeing you again soon! My best, Sam Johnson
0	Scary Place. I agree with everybody that rated this hotel low. It is pretty bad my wife did not feel safe and the room had a musty smell. Staff was ok but location and people around was scary. We ate our dinner and promptly left. Did not even bother try to get our money back.
1	Great night's stay at a classy hotel. My wife and I stayed here for one night prior to our cruise the following day. I searched the internet for perhaps 2 hours before I found this gem and made a reservation months in advance. We were picked up at the airport by the complimentary shuttle. The wait time was about 40 minutes. The front desk clerk was very pleasant and very accomodating. The check in went smoothly and I was even able to make port transfers at the same time (12 pp).Our room had 2 double beds with adjustable mattresses. The room was very clean and included several pillows for each bed. This hotel has its own restaurant but no complimentary breakfast. However, there is a Dennys and a McDonalds across the street as well as a gas station with a small store where you can get snacks and pop for the cruise ship. There is also a data center with free wifi, an exercise room and a pool w/ hot tub. This hotel also has a plan for storing your car for free while you are on a cruise if you stay only one night. I would recommend this hotel to my friends and anyone looking for a stay prior to a cruise.
1	Very Nice Hotel, Great View, Excellent Service.... Used up the last of my Hyatt Gold Points for a mini Sta-Cation at the local Grand Hyatt. It was a very choice. I paid for an upgrade to a corner suite, with a view... Of more buildings Not sure I needed to see more of the buildings.Five stars for me on this!Overall, and very nice hotel, very clean, well appointed rooms, plus the corner suites are very large, with a separate sitting area, bathroom, and bedroom. All very nice.Hotel reception was nice, very nice young man who checked us in, good sense of humor (which is very important, that he understands my jokes!). Bell man could have acknowledged my wife and I walking through, but decided to stare blankly out the door... Not sure about that (long day I guess).Sampled the attached restaurant for Happy Hour, which was very nice.Wish our Sta-Cation could have lasted longer, but we needed to head home.
1	Luxury NOLA Hotel. After being on a 7 day cruise that left out of New Orleans, we decided to stay and explore the beautiful city of New Orleans. We were with a group of friends who were staying at the NOPSI Hotel, so we decided to book a room there too, and boy were we glad we did. This hotel is virtually brand new, opening in July 2017. The NOPSI Hotel building formerly served as the headquarters of the citys power and transportation company, New Orleans Public Service Inc. Its absolutely amazing how this hotel has been transformed into such a gorgeous and luxurious hotel. As we pulled up to the hotel, we were warmly greeted by the bellmen, Bolton and Will. These gentlemen took great care of us and our belongings. What a great feeling to be welcomed so warmly the minute one arrives at a hotel! The rooms have the most comfortable mattresses, finest linens and all the amenities you could ever want, including robes. They bathroom is quite exquisite, with its grand two door entrance, marble countertops, double sink, and oversized shower.If so inclined, you can choose to indulge in an on sight spa service at the NOPSI Spa. There is an on sight restaurant, multiple bars, one in the grand atrium and one in the restaurant area. Be sure to check out Above the Grid, the rooftop pool and bar. Above the Grid is open to hotel guests and locals, providing everyone with an extraordinary view of the citys skyline. NOPSI Hotel is about a 1 mile from Bourbon Street. Its situated in a perfect location, walking distance from virtually all local attractions. We walked back and forth to Bourbon Street many times during our short stay. On sight parking is available for a fee. You should contact the hotel directly for daily rate charges. Pinot, Thank you for sharing your NOPSI Hotel experience. We are delighted that you enjoyed your stay. It has been exciting for us to finally share NOPSI with our guests. Whether you are dining at one our restaurants or relaxing in one of our well-appointed rooms, we are here to make your stay memorable. Warm regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager
0	Old. Like others have said it is clean and quiet. BUT... Old tattered towels I would use as cleaning rags. A gallon of paint would do wonders for the trim and the doors. When we were packing our car, the owner walked past two times but...More
0	Expected something better, got worse. This hotel was newly renovated, which made me expect something better. The room smelled awful, and there were dead crickets on our bathroom floor. The decor had in the room had in fact been updated. The bathroom had old tiles old tub old toilet with a new vanity top and mirror. Everything else was obviously old. Our black out curtains were held together with paper clips, we could hear EVERYTHING going on in the room next to us, the hallway, and upstairs! When any doors would shut, our room would loudly vibrate. Our check in clerk was very nice and she tried to help us with anything we needed... Also, no elevator and my parents who are elder, were placed upstairs, making it hard to get them and their luggage to their room! This simply was an emergency place to sleep, but I clearly overpaid, because it was no better than Motel 6 (and it was double the price)
0	Pitiful. Very few lights in the room were working. Microwave glass on front broken. Seal on refrigerator was broken. Had to dress for a wedding in the bathroom as this was the only place where there was enough light, management refused us a different room. I took pictures as well but management didn't want to see them when I reported when... More
1	A Reliable Kimpton Hotel. I returned to Hotel Solamar in San Diego at the end of July for a conference.This hotel lives up to Kimpton's reputation for great customer service willingness to please you and make your stay great.This hotel is located one block from the Gas Light district and the emerging East Village which is gaining a reputation for great new restaurants adjacent to the San Diego Padres ball park.All staff members are on top of their game from the front desk staff to Jesse at the pool bar to Guadalupe the housekeeper for my room and Hormand the manager of housekeeping who served as the host of the nightly free wine and beer gathering in the lobby.The hotel is great for business, couples, families and solo. There was a group attending a digital media conference, a honeymoon couple from Italy, a recently engaged couple from San Francisco and families from all over the country with young children. The SD Zoo is a short distance away and is great for young and old alike.The pool is small but the pool area is large and accommodating for food, drinks and lounging to use pool. I was not there on a weekend so the limited number of loungers around the pool was not an issue.There is nothing not to like about Solamar and I would recommend staying there no matter what your reason is for being in San Diego.Hey Richard C thank you for the great review! It sounds like you had a wonderful visit to the Solamar and we couldnt be happier to see that! Its true we love what we do here, I think you felt that first hand from Jesse, Guadalupe and Holman during your visit. Again, thank you so much for the kudos we are happy you came and hope you visit us again soon! Cheers! Shannon Foster
0	Smelly room with prank calls. When first walking in the room had a very strong smell of cleaners! We were told that all the rooms had just been cleaned and would smell the same. We got woke up at 1:40am by prank calls. Maybe they need a makeover!
0	Don't. One room key didn't work, carpets in hallway and at door filthy dirty, as for carpets in room, due to color, not able to see as much, but, come on, if outside door is visibly stained and dirty, what's expected inside. Continental breakfast ok. All night, as we checked in late, people,guests outside smoking and littering their cigarette butts all over. Don't recomend!
0	the worst hotel in our trip from LA. no breakfast on time or donuts from the frige, no Service, no place for garbage, water in bathtub don't run away, durty floor etc.etc. a horrible experience!!! we are from Germany and our american English is not as good to write more Details.
1	Great place in a great lovation. A little treasure of a place, free wifi and most importantly free parking. Guy on checkin was very friendly and welcoming. Room was very spacious, not a great view from our window, but we were only here one night for our night tour of Alcatraz and flight home the following day. It had aircon, great shower and the bed was very comfortable. Room was very clean.Hotel is in a great location from the piers, only a few blocks, there were a few homeless people about in the evening, which I admit does make you feel a little uncomfortable walking round of a night, especially as they were in groups, but it was fine.Next morning the guy in reception suggested we went to Pat's for breakfast. What a lovely place and the breakfast was delicious.We would stay here again.
0	2nd stay was not the charm. Honestly should have known better than to try a second stay. At least this time, the wifi eventually worked, but the desk clerk didn't even know that the room I was given didn't have a microwave / working refrigerator like my reservation said it would. At least there was a great fast mex restaurant within walking distance. When I returned, there were two squad cars and police at the room above me, sidestepping the dog feces in the parking lot, I got into my room took a hot shower, took note of the cigarette burns in the bathroom of the non-smoking room, and hit the clean sheets. Breakfast room was clean, food ok, big sign that said no taking food to rooms. -shrug- another hot shower and I got out of there. Won't go back.
1	Fantastic stay in Union Square. From the moment we were greeted by the doorman and the staff at check-in, everyone went out of their way to make sure we were taken care of. They provided parking options (60 for on-site valet), presented us with a welcome bag full of treats. They were even able to accommodate an early check-in. The location is fabulous. We chose Hotel Abri because it was over 100 less than a place across the street. I couldn't have been more pleased. I would definitely stay here again.Greetings letsgo168, thank you for the positive feedback. We are happy to know that we met your expectations. Come and see us again soon!
0	RATS! There were rats running around the outside.. Rats running around the parking lot. My husband and I saw FIVE rats running around the parking lot and one jumped out a trash can. I don't do rats I am always been afriad of rats and I wasnt expacting that. I didn't feel comfortable staying there. Management was'nt helpful at all. I was there for my son's graduation from the Navy he had completed boot camp. So this was an important visit. We had to find another hotel at night and I had to pay more money.No one was helpful to us at all.
0	Not satisfied. Not very good. Room had many issues. I had a total of 3 rooms and there were problems in each room particularly mine. Hotel staff is not very friendly. Probably overworked due to the fact that one person does about 4 different jobs. Cannot and will not get the attention you need if there is a problem
0	If you want to be falsely charged, stay here.. To say that the hotel was sub-par would be an understatment. The parking was good (though it was a really hard turn off from the road). The front desk staff was mostly friendly (one of the ladies in particularly was amazing). When we were going to our room we had to go through the pool area. The pool was alright... More
1	Classic building, mostly spectacular service, skip the food. We spent 5 nights here in a regular room in December. The good: We loved the building's character, and old NYC charm. The location can't be beat. The butlers were overall very helpful, especially Emina. The car service is lovely, and the driver we had (Robert) was very nice. The concierges were interacted with (I have forgotten names) were both superb. Housekeeping was OUTSTANDING after the first night. Very much appreciated. The bell staff and doormen were also mostly really great. We felt very welcomed most of the time we interacted with staff.The not as good: A few minor misses upon entering room for the first time - there was some debris from prior guests. One of the butlers didn't provide the same great service as the others. Nothing to be totally fussed about, but these misses stand out all the more against the otherwise stellar service. Really the only true disappointment was that we weren't impressed by our Room Service breakfast at all - best to skip.Overall, we really enjoyed our time here and do recommend if it fits your NYC plans.Dear Nakoa G,Thank you very much for reviewing your recent stay at The St. Regis New York. We greatly appreciate you taking the time to write you review and provide us with your feedback. We are pleased to hear that you enjoyed your room and the Butler service, but are disappointed that you were not impressed with your Room Service breakfast. We will share your thoughts with our Food Beverage team and will be sure to address this internally. We hope to have an opportunity to welcome you back on your next trip to New York City.Kindest Regards,Senih GerayGeneral Manager
0	Should have paid a little more and stayed somewhere else.... Not what we were expecting from a Best Western. Stayed here with my family of 4 because it was near the zoo and was expecting better from a Best Western. Room with 2 double beds was extremely small, hotel was quite dated and we felt uncomfortable. Thought we could get a roll-away bed with our room but they said it would not fit, They were correctm we could barely move in this tiny, tiny room! Will not stay here again.Dear levine331: Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your feedback. The Best Western Seven Seas is an older property however, we are continually upgrading our guestrooms, exterior, and other amenities in order to meet the needs of our guests. We are currently undergoing a 2 million renovation, so exciting things are yet to come. Based on hotel occupancy, larger guestrooms are available, so we apologize if you felt our guestrooms were too small. Thank you for choosing us for your recent hotel accommodations in San Diego and hope you will consider staying with us again, so we may have another chance to provide you with an excellent experience. Most Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff
1	Great location near the airport. Clean and quiet, very handy to the airport and a good shuttle service. Happy hour includes Samuel Adams products for 2.50, great deal! Just avoid the car rental location around the corner, it was very bad Value.The in house restaurant is handy when you have had a long day of travelling.Dear Guest greg p, I would like to thank you on behalf of my team for your kind comments on our performance and your experience on your stay. We know that when traveling our guests have many options to choose from and we value and deeply appreciate your loyalty and support. We want our guests to have the best stay possible where everything is like new, in place, of the highest quality, and in perfect working order. We are looking forward to welcome you, family and friends to once again provide you with an outstanding level of service and nothing less. Sincerely,Alex Blanco
1	A good experience. We had a good experience here. It is a bit pricey for the amenities and the size of the room, but fit our needs. The rooms are a lot smaller than most hotels. This was fine as we used the room as a home base and not a hang out place. The bed seemed somewhere between a queen and a full size. We did find a long hair on the mattress pad (I check for bed bugs, and you should too! I didn't find any or experience any here or ever, but I am really scared of them). There is no tub, just a shower stall. Small bathroom. But again, fit our needs. As other reviews have said, the sheets are very scratchy. This was my only complaint. The location is great, right in the middle of downtown, convenient to everything. It was just about 3 blocks from our El stop. The restaurant downstairs was pretty good, and very convenient for breakfast. We found the staff polite and helpful, though our interactions with them were limited. The fitness room was sufficient, the machines were fairly new. It was not fancy, but the equipment was good quality. It is a small space. The filtered water and bottles on each floor was a nice touch. We would go back.
0	Just okay.. I gave this place 2 stars because the carpets were filthy. The kids socks and feet were black after walking on the floors and carpets. Plus we found a clump of hair near the drapes. The problem becomes that you start to wonder what else is dirty that you can't detect. On the flip side, the front desk was very... More
0	Untruth advertising. I booked a 7 night adventure for my family thru Expedia but I had to change plans cause our dates were conflicting. I had cancel current reservation on March 21. In the info for the booking it stated no charges will be made if cancelled before April 21. I have been waiting now 10 days and no refund for deposit... More
1	Very helpful staff. Superb value for very fair price.. Good location convenient to drives through the vineyard districts and excellent downtown restaurants. Relatively new, well maintained hotel with large, bright, attactive, spotless, comfortable rooms. We must praise the staff and are greatful for their good natured, spot-on advice. Shawn was on duty when we arrived. She gave us great advice for drives and restaurants (loved Ristorante Allegria) and she even went online to compile a list kid-friendly vineyards. We should also mention Shanirra who was on duty in the daytime. The breakfast included in the price of the room is served in the adjacent Denny's. Food was standard but service was a bit slow. To be fair, it was a very busy weekend. I do not hesitate to recommend this hotel to our friends and we will certainly stay there again. By the way, I think you can help hotels save money (and maybe get you a better price) by calling them direct rather than useing third party resellers. (like Priceline, Travelocity etc.)Thank you for your review. We strive to give the best customer service possible to make everyones experience enjoyable. Shawn and Shanirra are a great value to our staff and I am pleased they had the advise and information you needed. You are right either book direct or at Bestwestern.com for the best price. We will see you again the next time your in the area.
1	memorial day weekend trip. this is a fantastic hotel, i think it is a hidden gem located in the arts district of Phoenix. It is a fairly new hotel, very different, in a good way, from your typical hotel. The grounds are spotless, plenty of fun places to eat all within walking distance. I would not say it is within walking distance in the middle of summer in Phoenix to Chase Field or Talking Stick Arena. But the light rail has a stop right in front of the hotel and with your game ticket it is a free ride or for 4 bucks per person you can ride the light rail anywhere all day. Valet parking, only option, is 25 per day but they were great. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Rooms are the best part, very industrial but super cool. Concrete floors with plenty of area rugs.Neat shower and here would be the only complaints. The room is very open, the bath room only has frosted glass between the bathroom and rest of the room. Light from the bath room floods the rest of the room, especially on night runs to the bathroom. And has at least one other has said, you hear ALL noises coming from the bathroom which can be embaressing. We were in room 709, top floor king room with balcony and had an inflatable bed which I slept on (25 per night) It was a south facing room and had a great view of the city. 100 percent recommend this hotel, plenty of art all around. Just a fun place, the hotel is a destination, just like a Disney HotelThank you so much! We're so happy to hear you had such a wonderful stay. Hope to see you again soon.
0	FILTHY !!!!. Was in town with friends for a Falcons game and a friend booked us a room at this hotel. The hotel is NOT on the better side of town and from the outside it looked run down. The woman at the front desk was nice...More
1	Well worth a visit!. After a long and arduous ten hour flight, followed by a crazy and dangerous shuttle drive ride down the San Francisco streets, we were met with a cordial, welcome from the young concierge at Hotel Diva who effortlessly sorted out the dispute with the aggressive driver. This was mirrored by the Receptionist who was charming and efficient. Our room was fairly small but well proportioned with all the required amenities. The hotel was in an excellent location in the centre of Union Square. There are many restaurants within walking distance, but I would recommend you book beforehand to avoid disappointment. There is a diner across the street which serves an excellent breakfast at a reasonable price! I would definately stay here again and will be recommending it to my British travel company, Hayes and Jarvis.
0	Not up to Homewood Suites Standard. This Hotel is not up to the standards my family is used to. The Front Desk staff were robotic and seemed annoyed. The Pool and spa were dirty and I got an attitude when I asked for pool towels. The evening social was a disappointment from what we have experienced from other Homewood Suites and the breakfast was lacking as well. The room was fine, a little outdated but the AC would turn on and off by itself and was really loud. One if the elevators broke down while my family was in it, luckily we were able to get out. This hotel is close to everything you want to do in the area, but i feel there may be a better choice somewhere else. We have had more than a few bad stays with the Hilton Brand lately. Not sure if I will continue being a Hilton Honors member. To top it all off, I wrote a review from the Trip Adviser link on my emailed receipt and it never got published. Not happy.
1	Great Service. Spent a week here last year. From the moment we walked in to reception the staff couldn't be more helpful. Saw the manager everyday walking around talking to everyone. Usual American breakfast plenty of it, but not to my taste, but saying that I found it same at all the hotels we stayed in for the month we were touring around the southern states. Plenty of fresh fruit, toast, oatmeal which was fine for me. Good coffee and tea was ok when you used two tea bags!! Room was large and extremely comfortable, nice bathroom and very clean. Plenty of towels and toiletries and good quality. Loved the pool on the roof and the Managers Reception every evening was an added bonus and very much appreciated. Would stay there again if we ever come back to new Orleans.
0	Not AARP friendly. You get what you pay for, but don't expect an AARP discount. Found and booked this location through the membership website but was told on arrival that they don't honor AARP, even though the AARP discount sticker is located on the lobby door, and, You already received our discounted rate. Location is okay and within walking distance of downtown, but don't do this alone at night. Found hairs of different types and texture in the bed and bath tub and, when issue taken to reception, was treated very rudely by clerk. Replacement sheets were also riddled with hair, which made for a very uncomfortable night's rest. No microwave, coffee pot, refrigerator, etc. in third-floor room, and no vending machine on the floor. Ice machine made horrible racket all night. Only coffee available is located in the lobby and comes in a two-swallow-sized cup. If you're looking for cheap rates, be aware of what you'll get here. Otherwise, go elsewhere and either rent a car or use car service. Like me, I'm sure you work too hard for your money to receive this type of treatment. Would not recommend if they paid me.
0	Suite room was unsatisfactory. We stayed in the 3 queen suite and were very disappointed in the room. Only one closet and NO dresser for possibly 8 people! The room was clean but uninviting. It felt like staying in a dorm room. The staff were great but the breakfast was average. Never saw any other rooms so can not recommend but will NOT recommend... More
0	Messy and smelled of bleach. We came to the hotel and weree so.overwhelmed with the smell of bleach that our eyes and throats burned. The carpet was damp with the stuff and we couldn't even open the windows to open it up. There were hairs all over the bathroom and there was trash under the beds.
1	First Time visit- very nice hotel. My husband and I loved the charm of this place , nice center courtyard,with pool and fountain, comfortable room with lovely comfy bed , nice shower -lots of hot water. The buffet type breakfast every morning was super. Eggs and sausage or bacon , toast,bagels,waffles,yogurt and fruit cups, very nice . The personnel were friendly and helpful. far from the noise of Bourbon Street but close enough to walk to farmers market,waterfront activities,shopping and Bourbon St. Try French Man St. for more local music and food. We stayed 3 days before a 7 day Caribbean cruise. Found it a lot of fun.
0	Very Disappointed. The room was tiny and there was nowhere to sit in the room except for the beds and 2 small chairs. One chair had a cigarette burn on it and the other chair had a stain that looked like skid marks. The sheets were clean and the mattress had good protective pad. The weekend breakfast was what you would find... More
0	Terrible!. Mold in bathroom. Blankets had fur balls (old). Klennex box rusted. AC loud. The property had old decor. Will not be returning to the property. I will not be returning to Red Roof Inn. If this is how they run their inns I will stay somewhere else.
1	No charge for parking. While looking for affordable accommodations in this area, I kept finding places that charged extra for parking, which is something that just rubs me the wrong way. Best Western Seven Seas has plenty of convenient parking, and I was able to park either right in front of our door, or at worst, a couple of spaces down. The room was average size and clean, the a/c worked and the shower had good pressure. Nothing fancy but all that we needed, and a good value for the area. It was very convenient to the freeway and we were able to get in and out easily. I took morning walks in the area and I did notice that most of the other hotels on Hotel Circle S also had free parking, but none had such a large and nice complex. I didn't utilize the pool or the hot tub, but I did see that many guests were, and both areas looked well maintained. A young man did come in while I was checking in asking if they had a basketball to go with the basketball hoop. They didn't, so if you think you or your kids want to shoot some hoops, bring your own ball. It is not a court, but just a simple hoop at the end of the parking lot.I will stay there again if in the area.Thank you for being our guest at the Best Western Seven Seas and taking the time to review our property, we really appreciate your feedback. Hopefully we'll welcome you back soon on your next trip to San Diego.
0	Crappy hotel. Don't stay here. Housekeeping seems to be useless, you can find dirt everywhere and staff is really unfriendly. I stayed here for two weeks and couldn't wait to run somewhere else. Besides no amenities in the hotel. Look for other options.Thank you for telling us about your stay. We are disappointed to hear that you did not have an enjoyable experience with us. Please accept our apologies. We will work with our housekeeping staff to ensure all areas of our hotel meet our standards moving forward.Thank you again for your feedback. If you would like to discuss this further, please do not hesitate to contact us personally at PER2extendedstay.com. We hope that you will give us the opportunity to provide you with a better stay the next time you're in the area.
0	Go somewhere else. This place is old and dated. The bed was really uncomfortable. They put a thick pad on top of the mattress I guess to make it better. Instead it just gets wadded up when you sleep. The coverlet on to of the bed was worn and pilled and you don't even want to sit on it. The room had an odd smell. The breakfast buffet was pitiful. I'm so glad we only had to spend one night here.
1	Outstanding. We were recommended this hotel from several groups of friends that have been there before. Let me just say they were spot on. An outstanding hotel with great friendly staff right on Waikiki beach. The room was huge with plenty of room for a family of 4 ( 2 teenagers ). Close to great food and shopping. Will be staying there again. Aloha Brett1975 and Mahalo for taking the time to compliment our hotel and give us five stars. Im delighted to read that you enjoyed your huge room and that it accommodated your family well. I am glad to read that you found our location and staff to be outstanding. Until we meet again- A Hui Ho!
0	Not worth the money. The room was so noisy we could hear every footstep from the people above, every toilet flush and every shower that they took. Winetasting in the courtyard was very loud and folks stayed after the winetasting drinking until the wee hours of the night . Staff was not willing to quiet them nor even leave the front desk to talk to them. Breakfast items in the morning were not replenished hot water was out replaced with warm water not useful at all . Rumors of free vouchers to Dennys never appeared .This was not a cheap property I do not feel I got my moneys worth I couldve stayed at a motel eight or six for equivalent valueOn behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you gave us to implement improvements to ensure we offer a better experience for guests in the future.
0	NEEDS HELP. breakfast was bad, room not clean and in need of repair, unprofessional appearance of staff, Dirty linins.
0	Marriott should remove name association with this hotel location.. Hotel literally on route 35..translation. .hwy noise all night.Hotel location central to a lot of things.Hotel not maintained. Not clean. No reinvestment in hotel updates. Kitchen chairs all ripped up. Need replacing. Room furniture terrible , embarrassing shape. Afraid to sit in. Courtyard is embarrassing. Overall management does not care in running a clean , well maintained hotel. I am a lifetime gold Marriott member. Stay in 100 hotel nights per year. I checked out 3 days earlier and moved to Marriott courtyard. ..Dear Mr. Donnelly and family,Thank you for your time to share your guest experience. I am disappointed that we did not provide you and your family a satisfying stay. I will review the suite accommodations provided for you during your stay so that we can further improve on the accommodations and services we offer our guests.I apologize and thank you again for giving us the opportunity by sharing your feedback.Sincerely,Traci
1	Perfect for a Solo Traveler - Very clean, nice location!. I went to Chicago last weekend for the Ryder Cup (Golf Tournament) and everywhere I usually stay was completely booked! Rooms were going for crazy rates, so I started seeking out some options that were 'off the beaten path'. I discovered the Central Loop Hotel, and I knew where it was, as I used to walk by it from time to time when I still lived in Chicago.The hotel is very well kept, and has cheap valet (34/night with in-and-out access!). THe check in process was a little strange to me because you check in using a machine like you would at the airport. Some people might love this - but i missed talking to a real person. The machine printed my room info and key card and I headed up to my 6th floor corner room.This room was perfect for my needs. Very comfortable bed, sparkling white linens, beautiful widows that overlooked some fantastic Chicago architecture (post office). But - this room was TINY! Again, it was just me and I knew I would only be spending time in my room sleeping, but the bathroom was very small (no tub, shower only) and the closet was tiny. Almost felt like a ship's quarters. If you are going as a couple, or even attempting to bring kids I would def. upgrade to a larger room or suite. The rooms have free wifi (yeah!), lots of cable channels, free in room coffee and a friendly concierge staff. Free bottled water stations on each floor are also a nice touch.I will stay here again if I'm traveling alone.
0	Polde. Filthy, outdated, noisy neighbours, but this was not the worst. We were nearly eaten by the bed bugs, more agressive than Denali bears. I would not reccomend this hole even to my worst enemy. Next day we needed medical help.
0	Never again. Overpriced hotel for the quality they offer. The other guests were inconsiderate. The barhroom was so small it was ridiculous. The shower head had no power. It needs a professional make over, not one done by a jack of all trades person. Thank you for taking the time to share this unfortunate stay with us. We are very sorry to hear your visit was less than excellent and can assure you this is not what we strive to offer our guests. We will share these comments with our team and wish that your stay would have been more enjoyable. Thank you again for letting us know.
1	Overnight in San Fran. We rolled into San Fran without pre-booking anything and found this gem. It's not the Hilton, but it was clean, friendly staff and, well, it was clean! Another big plus besides the awesome price was that there was no parking fee, which can be pretty costly. All in all, it's awesome overall value for where you are. Also worth mentioning, not sure if they are supposed to but they let us keep our vehicle in the parking garage for about an extra 5 hours after checkout, very cool!Thank you for staying with us and for your review.
0	Terrible hotel. The walls had unpainted spackle. There was a loose bulb hanging from bare wires in the bathroom. I told the front desk the bulb was a safety hazard and should be replaced but they didn't bother to fix it. I got the impression that they don't care about the condition of their own hotel.
1	Great Base for Disneyland, Angels, Convention Center. We spent 3 days at this hotel, whilst at a convention at the Anaheim Convention Center and at Disneyland. Although this is not the closest hotel property to either, it is the best as far as hospitality and professionalism go. We arrived a bit before the posted check in and before too long, we were able to go to our room. I have to say the visit to the Towneplace Suites, Anaheim was made exceptional by the staff that works there, notably Adilene at the front desk. The smiling and professional service that she provided is what one would expect at a Ritz Carlton or St. Regis property. Note to management: You should hold on to and value employees like Adilene.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for your 5 star review. I am glad to hear that Adi and our team were able to give you 5 star service during your visit to Anaheim.I hope to see you on our next Disneyland Adventure! Hospitably,Greg WilliamsGeneral Manager
1	Nice hotel. Clean and comfortable. We missed the complimentary drinks and snacks but They drinks and popcorn for us at check in. Pool and hot tub located on roof which was neat. We did have to pay to park 40 which we thought was unnecessary. I think they should include it in the price and those that want valet could have that available. It was hectic trying to leave bc there was only one the valet man and not room to unload and load up. I would have given this hotel a 5 star but we didn't like the parking situation.
1	Very Nice and Well Maintained. Stayed at the Renaissance while on business in Atlanta. Everything was very nice from check in on. The public areas were as well maintained and clean as my room. Bedding was great, no stains on the carpet, bathroom was very nice and clean. I didn't have the opportunity to dine in the hotel so I can't comment on restaurants or food. Front desk staff was very friendly.The only negative, which I didn't notice but others in my group did, was the noise coming from the open restaurant areas in the lobby. Seems that during functions rooms on upper floors (one person in our group was on the 7th floor) the sound travels up the elevator shaft.....just a guess. But again, I had no issues at all.Thank you for staying with us and sharing your experience. We hope to see you back again soon!
1	Just as good as Bellagio. The bathroom (size,soaking tub, walking shower stall, robes) is in the same league as Bellagio but with a bit extra...complimentary toothpaste, cotton balls/q tips. Yes, they even have a coffee maker (which Bellagio doesn't offer). The same with both hotels, electronic sensor frig, move anything and it will appear on your bill. There's a Starbucks downstairs off the elevator. So convenient to the name brand shops and restaurants. It was enjoyable. Got complimentary wifi for our stay. The electric shade works very well. We requested a late checkout ( 1 hour) but wasn't granted one. There's a complimentary umbrella to use in the closet in case of rain. Safe in the closet.
1	Best Location. Two reasons I didn't get 5 stars. 1. On the day of check out at 11:02am, the maid was knocking on the door for us to vacate. I understand check out is 11am, but we were packing everything up and we told her we would be out in 5 minutes. 2 minutes later, we received a call from the front desk telling us to vacate. When checking in, our room was not ready and we were told they would text us when the room was ready. We walked down to get something to eat and was never contacted. At 4pm, we walked over to check if the room was ready and it was. They failed to notify us as we were trying to hang out and wait before we could bring our things in and change for the beach. 2. Ice machine not near the room. The ice was near the front desk and there were several homeless people laying on the grass by the entrance from the beach. Four Stars were given because the room was clean, the location was the best to the beach, parking was free, and the free breakfast was just perfect. Although the cost of the room was very very high for a room with no ocean view.
1	Simply Fabulous. This was our second stay at the St. Regis, and this time we booked through American Express Platinum concierge. As part of their fine hotel's program, we booked for 2 days and the third night was comped. It also included 100.00 towards meals and complete breakfast for 2. Upon checking in, Hugo acknowledged me as a Platinum SPG guest and upgraded us to the Madison Suite! Every room comes with a butler, who will bring you complimentary tea or coffee service. There's a house Bentley which is available on a first come,first served basis. The food is extremely good in their restaurant and the King Cole bar is internationally famous.Dear 112traveler47, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor. We hope to see you again soon!Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager
1	Walkable. Perfect location on Pacific Beach. The Strand, the pier, restaurants and shops are all right there or within a block or two. Walking was a pleasure in San Diegos fantastic weather, especially at this hotels location on the coast. I found two car rental companies nearby with hotel pick-up but we didnt need them. Instead, we took advantage of the bus stops one or two blocks away for travel to attractions around town.The room was clean and comfortable. The desk and free wi-fi were handy when I used the public transportation Trip Planner on the SDMTS website. We slept with the balcony door open to get the ocean breeze and the soft soothing sound of the waves. The complimentary breakfast has ample choices. I recommend trying the self-serve waffle maker. We remedied the lack of fruit with a two-block walk to the local supermarket, storing the perishables in our hotel rooms refrigerator. The staff at the desk were always there and ready to be helpful, a plus since this was my first time in San Diego. Their three-day-advance cancellation policy took some improvising since our arrival date was uncertain.
1	Clean, Courtious and helpful. Due to an unexpected ice storm in Maine, we needed to leave a day early. Not only did this hotel take us in a day early, they let us into the room at 10 instead of 3! The food we brought along for our Coast Guard son survived! The hotel staff was amazing, helpful and courteous. The room was spotless, NO BED BUGS!!. The hotel is located close to Walmart, many nice eateries, shopping. 15 min from Newark, an hour or so from Virginia Beach and 5 min from the Coast Guard Base. Thank you so much for making our stay in Suffolk, Virginia. We will certainly be staying there in June when our son graduates A school! Thank you!
1	Perfect Location Wonderful Stay !!. Check in at this beautiful hotel was effortless, professional and helpful. I asked for two restaurant recommendations and both were winners! We stayed four nights in room 804 which at first glance appeared smaller than expected, but, as it turned out, was just the right size for our two overhead sized suitcases to place on the luggage racks. The room includes a desk with chair, a refrigerator, a small three drawer chest, two night tables, a nice sized closet with lots of hangers, room safe, and a most comfortable bed. Water pressure in the shower was not so good. Wake-up call service did not happen on one of the two mornings that we had requested. Our room was immaculate, linens were great, lighting, both natural and artificial was really good and the location was absolutely perfect!! Within walking distance to many attractions and less than a two minute walk to China Town! Breakfast was included with our room. The restaurant is beautiful and relaxing and the server, Worem, is exceptionally welcoming, warm, and most attentive. Breakfast was a hit and miss, one day perfect and the remaining days, sadly, off. Highly recommend visiting Alcatraz, Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory at 56 Ross Alley in China Town and of course, walking around China Town.It's fantastic to hear you had an effortless stay! We're always so happy to give any recommendations, and we're glad they ended up working out for you. Please keep us in mind the next time you're in San Francisco. It would be great to see you back. Sincerely,Pablo B. General Manager
1	excellent location and service. On a vacation to Chicago IL we made reservations at the River Hotel. From the excellent care from Roman King upon our arrival to the very efficient, clean and comfortable room our stay at the River Hotel was wonderful. The River Hotel goes above and beyond the traveler's expectations with very helpful extras. The complimentary chilled purified water in refillable bottles and complimentary laundry facilities were wonderful. Roman King greeted us warmly, facilitated a very speedy and smooth check in and gave us excellent restaurant recommendations for our dinner meals. The location near the Trump building is perfect for easy access to transportation and walking to key Chicago sites. We are now big fans of the River Hotel! Thanks for a very enjoyable stay. The Smith Family
1	Wonderful place to stay. We were extremely pleased and surprised with our stay at this hotel. The staff was extremely helpful and went out of the way to make our stay comfortable. There was a lifeguard at the pool and 2 computers in the lobby with internet access that we could use anytime we wanted, which we never expected. There was a full breakfast every morning which was superb! There was a shuttle to the Metro that ran from 7am-10pm and anywhere within 3 miles of the hotel, but you had to be prepared to wait. The hotel is walking distance to Springfield Mall and restaurants. Don't rent a car to go to WA DC as the Metro will get you within walking distance of the major attractions, saving you time and money. If we go back to DC we will stay there again.
1	Small and Adorable. We stayed over fall break to take advantage of San Diego's pay for an adult/ child in free. They had remodeled the rooms since we were last there. The bathroom was very nice and so was the bedroom. It came with a mini fridge and microwave plus table to allow us to eat breakfast daily in our room. I hope that they will eventually have a breakfast for their guests because that would make it a perfect location with it walking distance to the beach. We are very pleased that you came back to stay with us. I hope you will come back again soon!
1	Good, clean hotel. I stayed here for four nights this month after flying down to see the MLB All-Star game. I booked my room online and checked in via the Hilton app the night before my arrival. This enabled me to choose my room (I chose one on the 7th floor- the top floor). Accessing the hotel is easy to do, as it is right off of a highway. The location isn't in the greatest area, as there was always heavy traffic when turning back onto the main road leaving the hotel. Dining options on the main road near the hotel aren't great either. Check-in when I arrived was quick and easy and took less than a minute. Everything in the room appeared clean. The beds were extremely comfortable. Every employee at the hotel seemed to enjoy their job and was friendly. The hotel includes an outdoor pool, an exercise room, a guest laundry area, and a business center with two computers and printers. It also has a small area to the left of the front desk that sells a variety of items, including snacks, frozen meals, ice cream, and beverages (including beer). If there was one area the hotel could improve in, it would be having thicker walls. At night, I didn't hear much noise. However, every morning around eight o'clock, voices in rooms around me woke me up and made it hard to sleep. I'm not sure if it was the guests in those rooms or the housekeeping staff, but it seemed to occur every morning I was there. As for noise from airplanes (considering the hotel is close to the airport), the room was quiet late at night, but not so much once the sun came up. All things considered, I would definitely stay here again if I were to return to Miami. The rates were very reasonable, especially considering what other hotels in the city were charging. Also, the parking is free.
1	More than a sign change. If you're familiar with Key West, you'll recognize the location as the old Day's Inn. But the changes are more than just the signage. I figured it would be a new sign and fresh paint. Not so. A number of years back, numerous hotels on the entry end of the island were taken out of the inventory for revitalization, including the Days Inn. They gutted it, and the changes are significant.The room was large, as was the bath. Just a shower, no tub in room 148, which was fine. Bed was comfy, a/c worked great. In fact, I had no complaints at all about this property. The complimentary breakfast included pork sausage, turkey sausage, scrambled eggs, omelets, make your own waffles, plus pastries and fresh fruit. Not your typical complimentary breakfast.Pool is large enough, and plenty of lounges, as well as canopies. There's a Tiki Bar and music playing. Now for what may be a concern for some.The hotel is at the entry to the island. All traffic on or off the island passes through the intersection out front. Since the hospital is on Stock Island (just next to Key West) ambulances going there, pass right by. Sirens don't bother me, but if you get upset over them....well, since the island is 2 miles by 4 miles, maybe this isn't the place for you. There were numerous sirens from law enforcement, fire, and ambulances each day, but I didn't notice them at night.I had no complaints about this place. The only shortfalls, were that there was only one wastebasket in the room, which was next to the computer desk. Another in the bath would have been nice. Also, the parking spaces were a bit narrow, but nothing I couldn't deal with.Front desk and all staff were great. Property gets a recommended!Please note: There are two Fairfield Inns on the island. One at 2400 N. Roosevelt, and this one at 3800.Thank you for the very detailed review. We truly appreciate you taking the time to share your experience with our readers. Glad to hear you had time to enjoy our breakfast and enjoy some sun poolside. We look forward to welcoming you back to the Keys Collection!
1	Vintage Modern at It's Best!. I love everything about The Pearl Hotel and Restaurant! I booked the Essentials package, that came with free parking for your stay, two complimentary cocktails, and one appetizer. I stayed in Room 3 and everything was great! The bed was super comfortable and I had a wonderful nights sleep. The room comes with a small patio area, which in my opinion is just ok. I think it could be a little bigger and more private, but if your not going to use it then it shouldn't be a big deal to you. At the Restaurant, the bartender was awesome! He knows what he's doing and is willing to help you out. A+ for the serivce he gave. I think his name might of been John Don't quote me on that though! lol The ONLY things that I think could be improved would be the bathroom, carpeting, and mosquito problem. The carpeting in the room was almost rope like in feeling so I wore sandals when I walked around. The bathroom was not disgusting but it did look run down. There was also this strange occurance of several small mosquitos I caught flying in the room. I think they might be coming from the plants. Those problems are small and the rest of the experience was so great , I was able to overlook the little things. Don't get me wrong, I am super picky when it comes to hotels! I highly reccommend staying here. For people who are constant complainers (you know who you are) don't stay here if you want a nice quiet getaway, there is a Hilton down the way for you.thanks for the GREAT REVIEW!!!!! Super cool. Appreciate it. John is awesome. will let him know. Our staff truly goes the extra mile to create that guest experience. so glad you enjoyed it. your note about the bathroom is well taken and we are addressing it in the near future. hope you come stay with us again soon.
0	Good luck if there is a concert in town. The people at the front desk are rude and not helpful. If there is a concert the weekend you are looking to book, they just hang up on you. What do they care, the hotel is already booked. Low class service.
0	No...just no.... Disgusting. Poorly kept rooms and grounds. Repairs are as cheap as possible. Unless you have no choice, I would go somewhere else...in a hurry!! Know around town to be housing many unsavory guests. Dirty, no good, a waste of money. Even for a single night. The first night I stayed, my dog found a piece of a crack pipe. She... More
1	Such awesome service. My husband has business here and I tagged along. What a fantastic hotel. The service is impeccable. When we checked in I had bruised my wrist, freak accident. My husband asked for an ice pad. They gave us 2 ice pads and was so concern. We checked into our awesome and perfect suite, not 5 minutes. We heard a knock on the door. Anthony, security management, was at the door with a note of well wishes for me plus a box of gourmet cookies. We were just blown away how fabulous his concern was for us as their guests. We can't say enough how awesome the service is for this hotel. Highly recommended. Wish I could give it a 6 stars. :)Thank you for a perfect review! We are so happy to hear you enjoyed your stay with us here in San Diego.
0	Disappointing.. Staff not all that friendly or helpful at check-in. Hot water was scalding and regulator did not work properly. Breakfast was not great. Toilet had slow leak.
0	Man in breakfast area was disrespectful. The hotel was very clean and was very comfortable. It seems to have been kept up real well. I would've gave this place a higher rating but I felt disrespected by a bald man that serves the breakfast. I went into get breakfast and he was just standing there staring at me. he kept offering me more food and following... More
0	Close to everything downtown.. Close to downtown. That was about the only good review I can give. For a Westin The cheap thermostat causing the air conditioner not to stay at a consistent temp. down to the cheap supplied hair dryer that takes 30 min to dry a short hair person. Hope you like the neighbors because you will hear them coming and going all night long.
0	Don't waste your money. We had a king suite with sleeper sofa for three adults. We arrived at about 1'0:30 pm tired from our trip only to find out there were no sheets or pillows for the sleeper sofa. It took two trips to the desk to get what we needed. Then we discovered that the sleeper sofa was hard as concrete. Folded it... More
0	Do not go to Liquid pool club. Me and my 3 girlfriends went here. Bouncer was extremely rude to my friend who had sunglasses on and accused her of being drunk and barely let her into the club even though she didn't have anything to drink the whole day. Eventually we got in and paid cover but the pool closed 2 hours early. We still had an... More
0	Not a good stay!. The room was dirty it was hair everywhere the counter and table was sticky the shower made a really loud noise when you turn it on just not a good experience
0	For the cost of a Marriott stay you get a Motel 6 kinda room. I would never stay here again. The food at the basic breakfast buffet was good and the front desk was nice BUT the rooms were terrible. We were notPut in the tower but in the low rise Motel 6 type section. Bathroom was extremely small. (Door will hit your knee and you can touch the ceiling with the palm of your hand). Our rooms overlooked the pool and their was a connecting balcony along the outside of all rooms overlong pool. Did not like that feature or the bright lights kept on all balconies thru the night and the curtains poor design allowed for a lot of light tocome into the room. Sheets were too small for the bed and didn't even cover the mattress. Carpet on stairs to our floor was years past its replacement date. Walls thin. I could hear hairdryers etc in next room, kids having fun in the pool and planes from O'Hare at night. It was NOT a peaceful stay. For the cost of a Marriott stay you get a Motel 6 kinda roomDear Wendy Z,Thank you for taking the time out of your day to write to us about your most recent stay. We value your constructive criticism, without your feedback we would not be able to learn and grow in our quest for excellence in guest service. We hope that if you find yourself in the area again you'll give us a chance to make it up to you. Wishing you safe travels!
1	Dream Team!!!. I would like to thank Guest Service Manager Rena for making my stay special. I had a very nice talk with her about her career at Marriott. She was quick to let me know how proud she is of her staff. She should be, they are wonderful. From the time I checked in, her entire staff made me feel welcome and very comfortable. Emily in the restaurant suggested a couple of her go to specials, and she was right on. Delicious!! The hotel was in immaculate condition. The rooms are large and very quiet. Sleeping on the road can be difficult. No problem here. I slept like a baby. Thank you again Rena.....I highly recommend this hotel for business travel, and family travel for all occasions.Hi Tom,Thank you so much for your outstanding review! Rena is well respected for her outstanding customer service and I'll be sure she is aware that you mentioned her in your review. I'm very happy that you were able to enjoy our in house restaurant, Palettes, and found the food to be delicious. I will also be sure to let Housekeeping know how happy you were with your room cleanliness and the clean public space. We work hard to ensure all our guests' stay is as pleasurable as yours was.We look forward to being of service to you once again when you return to Las Vegas!Safe Travels,
1	Loyal Ocean Park customer. I just returned from my 3rd stay at the Ocean Park Inn. After reading some of the negative reviews, I had wondered if maybe a change in staff had resulted in some bad service. Happily, this was not the case. My friend and I were greeted with smiles upon our early check in and every encounter with the staff after that was pleasant and helpful. The location of this hotel can not be beat. The view is perfect and it's within easy walking distance of a million things to do. I think that the bad reviews sprinkled through this hotels listing must be from people expecting an ocean front Ritz Carlton for the price of Motel 6. Stay at this hotel with an open mind and you will NOT be disappointed!
0	will never return. Woke up with crazy bug bites.
0	Look somewhere else. Booked a room for a few nights. Got there late at night because of my flight. Went to check in and give my employee discount and they said they couldn't even though I called in advance to let them know. They told me there limit employee discounts and they can't do them. It's one or the other but I was like how can you limit an employee discount. So I cancelled and booked one night to let management know next morning. Got in my room and the first thing I noticed was it smelled like pose. My wife went to the bathroom and saw a dead smashed roach on the floor and a small one in the tub. They had no towels or rags in the bathroom as we would not use them anyway from what we were experiencing. We slept with our clothes on and checked out asap. I booked another hotel while staying the night there. Didn't care about the discount just wanted out of there. Didn't get any sleep as we took turns staying up to make sure no unwanted friends wanted to tag along.
0	Not great. There were bugs in our room, the window was cracked, the bathroom was dirty and for breakfast it was either pancakes or cold cereal. The beds were terrible, and the floors were so thin we could here everything the people upstairs said and did.
1	Great room and amenities but not ideal location for much of downtown. The service and room were very nice. The room was quite and clean and had comfortable seating. The shower was modern and also very clean. I loved that they provided ear plug on the night stands. I did not need them here but they came in handy at other hotels later in our travels. The hotel was close to the Space Needle and the other attraction near there but not close to Pike's Place Market and other downtown restaurants and shops. If you don't mind a walk or grabbing other transportation, this hotel is a good value.Thank you for your review. We are happy to hear you enjoyed your stay. We do strive to provide a great hotel at a great rate and we are pleased to hear you appreciated the value. We hope to welcome you back the next time you are in Seattle!
0	Not impressed. I'm surprised this hotel is even part of the Best Western chain. They supplied only one wash cloth. We got a conditioner bottle, but no shampoo. Our food was thrown away even though we had it neatly stored in a box on the coffee table. The buffet breakfast was lacking. It had stale donuts and danish. The only hot food was hard boiled eggs and grits. On the positive side, bed was comfortable and good front desk service.
1	Heavenly Stay. We stayed for New Years Eve 2016. From the minute we walked in the door we were treated like preferred guests. Abraham and Maria made us feel right at home. They were even kind enough to keep the bar open so we could enjoy a drink after a long day of travel. Paul, Lane, Justin and Jess were all fantastic behind the bar. The Shipwreck was out of this world and Paul should be nominated for Sainthood for the way he makes this drink. Overall, we had a fabulous stay. The pool was warm and with some adjusting of chairs we were able to catch some sunshine. The hotel location was absolutely ideal. We walked everywhere and there were wonderful places to eat and drink all around us. This is the place to stay in Key West! Thank you so much for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We are so happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us and that you were able to indulge in one of our delicious drinks. We will be sure to pass along all of your kind words to each staff member you mentioned. Please come back and see us!
1	Great getaway. Wonderful location ..... walking distance to shops restaurants trolly and train stations. Great staff, Vanessa at front desk and shuttle driver Rudy were exceptional. Lovely grounds and room very nice. Told everyone I know about our trip and planning another soon. Only drawback is parking limited but with train and trolley being only a couple of blocks walk away dont really need a rental.Thank you for recommending Best Western Plus Hacienda Hotel Old Town to friends and family! Your experience reflects that exceptional hospitality goals we strive for. Vanessa and Rudy will both receive recognition for providing great service! Im also happy to hear our location was super convenient for walking to restaurants, shops, the trolley and train. We look forward to your return. If you call direct, our team is happy to help with all aspects of trip planning including making sure youre getting the best rates we offer. Please dont hesitate to reach out to me if I can ever be of assistance. Until then - enjoy the beautiful spring season! Regards,Ryan AguinaldoGeneral Manager
1	Nice Location. On a visit to San Francisco my husband and I decided to take a quick over night with friends to Napa and ended up at Inn at the Vines. The hotel is a little older but in pretty good shape. Our room was large and clean enough! The location for us was good. We enjoyed the breakfast in the morning.The poor girl checking us in was alone and pretty darn busy. She was great though!! We would certainly recommend the hotel for anyone staying a night or 2 in Napa!!Thank you for your review and compliments on our hotel.Come back and see us again.
0	Bad experience!. This was a horrible stay. The hotel was run down and dirty. We were not able to get to our reserved king room because supposedly the battery in the door was going bad and couldn't get in after going back to the office 3times. We were finally given a room with double bed. We would have gone elsewhere but ther were no vacanicies in the town. When arriving after driving for hours we were told there was no restroom to use and then trying to get into our room with no success, we ended up going to a restaurant next door. We will never go to the Super 8 in Crawfordsville again. When we told them we were unhappy with a room with a double bed, we were told you wont be able to do anything since you didn't go through them directly (since we booked through hotels.com)
1	Very Good place to stay. Very close to the Space Needle, EMP Museum and Duck Tour ride. Our room was close to the Monorail track but there was not much of disturbance. Walking distance to all attractions or you can take the Mono rail to down town locations. Very good breakfast. Rooms were very good with a small kitchen.SriGa,Thank you for staying with us next to the Space Needle! We love our incredible location and are ecstatic that you felt the same way. As one of the newest members to the Hyatt family, we are more than appreciative of your feedback and am glad to see you enjoyed your stay. We pride ourselves on our guest satisfaction and hope to see you again soon in the near future.Sarah Junge
0	Horrible!! Don't waste your money!!. I'm driving back to NC from RI and I needed to get some sleep. I checked into this room and the front desk clerk was nice and prompt. As I walked into my room, I hear the phone ring and it's the front desk ask me to keep the noise down, I am all alone and just walked in this... More
0	Not Happy!. Careful when you book this place, especially if you book via a third party! We booked and supposedly paid for the hotel when we booked it, yet we had money taken when we checked out. I have since been informed by the company that I booked it through that this is a non refundable hotel and therefore we had already paid! so we now have to claim a refund from Hampton Inn for charging us twice! Not a comfortable nights sleep, pillows were terrible, WIFI was in and out, staff were unhelpful and so on. Simple sum up here, stay somewhere else!Thank you for your review. We greatly appreciate your feedback and were very sorry for negative experience at our hotel. If you would like to discuss these issues in more detail, please contact us at the information below. We look forward to hearing back from you soon. Hotel Management(858) 792-5557SANDLHamptonHilton.com
1	gateway getaway. This boutique in the heart of Waikiki was excellent. The newly renovated rooms are clean, modern, and nicely furnished. A shout out to Will who made our stay at Gateway so special!! Will told us about some local restaurants and pointed out places nearby that we could visit. I am from SC and my friend is from Georgia. We really appreciated Will's Southern hospitality. Can't wait for a future visit to Waikiki and I'll be sure to book my stay at Gateway!Aloha kbsuarez,Thank you so much for staying with us and taking the time to share your experience. It warms my heart to hear you recognize Will. Our unbeatable staff strives to fill every guest's stay with Love Aloha team members like Will make this happen every day. We can't wait to see you again.Love Aloha,Kainua HopkinsGuest Experience Manager
0	This hotel is the WORST!!. The man at check desk was rude and yelled at me. The door was poorly hung, therefore you could see light, the bathroom fan was so loud you could not shower with the light on, there was a very thin and hole filled blanket on the bed, there was no coffee pot or microwave as promised, the fridge froze the contents, the carpet was gross on bare feet, and there were no hand towels only a wash cloth and bath towels. Was robbed by this stay. WAY more money than it was worth!!!!!
0	Looked fairly clean at first sight, but..... We stayed here due to close proximity to where we were going. Online, it appeared to be the best of the 3 in this small town. We didn't expect a 4 or 5 star... But we did expect a clean place to catch some sleep. Fairly run down and I can understand that in a small town, but there's no... More
1	Absolutely brilliant hotel! Can't rate it highly enough!. We were only in the solamar hotel for 2 days but it was one of the best hotel stays we've ever had. The hotel is beautiful and luxurious and provided everything we could have needed- free (and great quality) rental bikes to explore the city, spare toothbrush when my battery ran out, complimentary wine hour every day (with yummy snacks too!), beautiful pool and roof top bar, gorgeous spacious rooms, great location and super friendly, thoughtful and helpful staff. It was my first stay in a kimpton hotel and now I don't want to stay anywhere else! Absolutely a brilliant review! Thank you so much Jen A. Looks like we turned you into a true Kimptonite! We'll see you next time! Justin- AGM
0	Sucks. Guest services was amazing. The condition of the hotel left much to be desired.
1	Good stay. We stayed 4 nights at this boutique hotel. At first, we were quite disappointed about the rooms, being quite small and having a very tiny bathroom but it does the job. Though small, the setting was nice and the overall ambiance in the hotel is great. Unfortunately they didn't have rooms available with the two seperate beds, as they looked nicer. They have a very nice fitness, and a good business room. They have a small lounge on every floor nicely decorated. You cannot have breakfast at this hotel but starbucks is next to the hotel, and otherwise you could check the block for a nice restaurant such as the Brasserie.Bad point was the Valet service which was not very quick though, and our car seemed to have a few scratches when we got it back from them. Luckily the rental company didn't notice. Washing service is quite expensive as well.Overall quite a good stay!Dear Maxvdo,Thank you for staying at Hotel Diva. We do offer various types of accommodations, all ranging in size. Perhaps an Executive King on your next visit would be more suitable to you r needs. I have been working closely with the valet company to further improve their services. Please accept my sincere apology for the inconvenience. I hope you will think of us again on your next visit to San Francisco. We look forward to welcoming you back at Hotel Diva.Best regards,Virgil LopezHotel Manager
1	Spring Break with the family. After spending a previous spring break at the Hilton Resort on Mission Bay, we decided to find a place on the ocean. The Ocean Park Inn was the perfect place for our family to stay. Based on reading other's reviews, we requested an upper floor ocean front room. The view from our room was fantastic and we even found enough space on the small balcony to enjoy a cold drink and watch the sunset. The best part is the location. Being right on the boardwalk meant we barely used our rental car the entire trip. We walked north on the beach and explored the tide pools, we walked to lunch, we walked to dinner and were never bored walking south from the hotel.If we are ever in San Diego again, Pacific Beach and the OPI is where we will stay.We're happy to hear you and the family enjoyed spring break with us! You're absolutely right about our location - there is so much to do within walking distance, but at the end of the day it's also nice just to enjoy the breeze and sunset from your balcony! Thanks for uploading some great pics as well - we'll see you next time.
0	NEVER AGAIN!!!. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!Wrong decision. The very same night we arrived I found 4 roaches in the bathroom. Horrible smell.!After 1 hour I was changed to another room with 1 roach.I was told the hotel was booked.Unsafe elevator, buttons missing, had to use the stairs.

1	What a find - great all around place to stay!. I stumbled across Hotel Diva while searching for places to stay for the weekend when one our of go to hotels was booked . What a find...it will be our new go to hotel! Great all round from location, to comfort and amazing staff. Walkable to/from public transportation for those who arrive via BART or Ferry. I highly recommend staying at Hotel Diva.Wow! Thank you for taking the time to share your 5 star stay at Hotel Diva! We are delighted to hear you had a wonderful visit and we are honored to be your new go-to hotel in San Francisco! We appreciate you recommending us and hope to welcome you back again soon!
0	Disappointed. We stayed at the SpringHill Suite Norfolk Old Dominion University for our daughter's graduation. Upon check in we were told that even though we had prepaid our room or so we thought that Old Dominion SpringHill Suites didn't actually charge us. We were ok with that. We checked in Shaneel at the front desk was amazing. An asset to the... More
1	Nice hotel - would stay here again.. Great location in Midtown. Hotel had a cool vibe and was clean and everyone was very nice and helpful. The price was not too expensive either. The rooms are small, but that is to be expected in NY. I had a king room and there was plenty of room to get around and for two suitcases with 2 adults. The bathroom was rather small, so be prepared. They do charge a resort fee, which included a drink ticket and laundry. Sadly, when you are only there a weekend, you do not need laundry, so that is a bit of a waste and un-needed. But definitely use the drink tickets in the hotel lobby bar since you paid for it! This hotel met all my needs and would stay here again if back in NYC.
0	Nice until I checked my bank account. Now I probably will not stay again.. I stayed at this hotel for business when I had to work late one night and needed to stay in the city. I chose this hotel because my company had just had their quarterly meeting here and I thought it was very nice. Check in was easy and everyone was very friendly. I love the dcor. Upon check in I was given a 10 bar card to use either at the bar or from the mini bar. I ordered a salad to go and took it to my room to eat. The room is decorated so cute. I loved it. I had the queen room and it is very small. It was fine for me but might be a bit tight if you had another person. I chose a drink from the mini bar to use my free 10. The next morning I filled out my free drink card and even took down my list of bar items as it said to do upon check to make sure I was credited for the correct item. I was asked if I wanted to use the other part of my 10.00 towards my salad and I said sure, I guess. No problem...finished my check out and headed to work. Today I check my bank account and I have two charges...one for the original amount including the hold, and another for the amount I actually paid when I checked out. When I called and asked why I was charged twice, they said well...instead of refunding you the 3.00 on the salad they did a full refund and full charge. Well guess what, this doesn't work well.....I now have two hotel charges and no refunds, as it takes several days before the refund hits your bank. I could have cared less about the 3.00, especially had I known how much of my bank account it would eat up. Luckily I had it in the bank, but I need it...I don't have a ton of extra money to just tie up an extra 172.00 for a 3.00 refund. I think this is a horrible practice and I certainly should have been told about it upfront. I am not sure if I will stay here again, I do not like to have my money messed with. :( Very disappointed.Ouch! This makes me upset to read. I'm sorry that a great experience turned out to be a disappointment. Can you please reach out to me via email at rachel.rodriguezallegrochicago.com so I can review your bill and make sure everything is taken care of the right way and make things right. I look forward to hearing from you.Rachel RodriguezGuest Experience Manager
1	Nice but something missing. I have stayed at this hotel many times. It is a very nice hotel but the elegance was not what it has been in Previous visits. When I arrived, the valets seemed annoyed that we did not pay for valet parking. On previous visits, they were extremely gracious and did not mind that we self parked. Hotel reception was very professional but again, something was off. I am not slamming the hotel, just noting that something has changed. I ask the management to please review your previous management style and return to that management style My wife also commented that something had changed. It is still a very nice hotel and the rooms are very clean and pleasant.
1	orlando. The stay was great above all the comfort and excellence of the comfort of bed and pillows is what is really important in getting a excellent night's rest for what awaits the next day. Service was friendly and helpful. Restaurants within walking distance of hotel.Dear Steven M,On behalf of the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport team, thank you for sharing your wonderful comments and rating regarding our performance and experience during your stay. We are proud of our housekeeping team in keeping our rooms fresh and clean for all our guests, and with comments such as yours, it confirms that they are staying on target in achieving our goals. Thank you again, we hope to have the opportunity of pampering you the next time you are in the Orlando Airport area.Sincerely,Alex BlancoGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando International Airport
1	Great Location, Excellent Breakfast, Great Price!. Overall, a great place to stay. Area is east of Hotel Circle with less congestion easier freeway access. Stayed on the ground floor, steps from the pool and breakfast room. The room was a small suite that appeared to have been recently remodeled with 2 flat screen tv's, fridge, microwave, separate living area with a sofa bed, queen bed in the bedroom and a large bathroom. One of the best free hot breakfast buffets we've ever encountered. Huge serving area, separate dining area for approximately 40 people and an additional outside patio seating area. We stayed on a weekend and no lines for breakfast. Be aware that the hotel charges 12 a day for parking (lot is very large). At less than 75 a night on a weekend, this hotel is definitely a keeper!Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your comments with us. We work very hard to make sure all of our guest have an enjoyable and restful visit. We are very glad to hear that we were able to exceed your expectation.We truly look forward to serving you again soon.Thank you again for staying with us.Warm regards,Laura Benson
0	Loud. The rooms are poorly insulated from the outside noise. There is a bar of some sorts next door that played loud music both nights during our two night stay. It was so loud I could hear and understand individual words from the songs - through the walls of both the motel and the bar. It's not just that though, you... More
1	A nice, affordable hotel near Union Square. I found the Diva an ideal hotel for the price and the location, and I have no major complaints about the service or the room. I booked one of the slightly larger rooms, which made my stay more enjoyable. It had a couch and table to accompany the more standard hotel furniture and king-size bed. Someone referred to the furniture as office, but it would more properly just be called urban contemporary. I rather liked it. The bathroom was a bit small and not the greatest, but it sufficed. Not too many TV channels, but a nice large TV and free internet. The location is very convenient to BART, Union Square shopping, theaters, artsy places, restaurants, and larger conference hotels (such as the Hilton). The area is active, bustling, and a little gritty, but nothing to be too worried about as a guest. Overall, I would recommend it, and I definitely plan to stay there again when I need a room in downtown San Francisco.
1	Stay, Park Cruise. We recently stayed at the Hilton before leaving on our 11 night cruise. I had researched safe places to leave our car during our cruise and came across so many mixed reviews. When I looked into staying at the Hilton Airport West, they offered a package for those cruising out of Miami that included your accommodations, full breakfast, shuttle service to the port and up to 15 nights parking. Their long term parking lot is directly in front of the hotel and is well lit. Parking usually costs 10-15 a day in most public lots and not all of them have 24hr. security. The hotel is very nice, great breakfast and they offer 3 departure times to the port. They can't offer shuttle service from the port but we were greeted as soon as we exited the port with a 10 per person shuttle service back to our hotel or airport.
0	Terrible. Basketball shorts, tee shirt, and sitting on stool texting must be within Baymont uniform requirements. Rooms are dingy, dirty and smell of cigarette smoke in a non-smoking room. Couldn't spring for a box of kleenex in a 135/night room One staff member in morning to check people out, prepare and replenish breakfast and take care of trouble calls. Went to... More
1	nice room. Nicely decorated room with modern furnishings. It has a mini bar with a good selection of drinks to purchase. There is a rooftop pool and lounge on the 4th floor, which is nice on hot days. The room was quiet and an easy to operate thermostat. Nice location in the gas lamp area--lots of night life with in walking distance.Thank you Damon R for the 5 STAR Review! It sounds like everything went perfect with your visit. I'm happy to see that you enjoyed the newly renovated rooms, location and amenities. I hope to have you back with us again when you return to San Diego. All my best, Shannon
0	Disappointed!. We have stayed at this property for years and loved it, but noticed that it was going downhill over the past couple of years. After our last stay, we were so disappointed that we decided to try a new property for our next vacation. Based on our last stay, we have the following comments: * Pool area: Very few lounge chairs, most of which are broken. This is not a new problem...it has been ongoing for years. Smoking is allowed in the enclosed pool area, which poses a health and safety hazard especially for small children. During our last stay, there was a man that parked himself at one of the tables all day and smoked cigars. Since we were travelling with our 1 year old, we asked if he wouldn't mind refraining from smoking while we were with our infant, but he continued to smoke. Since smoking is allowed in this area, the hotel chose not to take action. After moving, we were still in the path of the smoke, plus another guest chain smoking cigarettes. There is a seating/table area just outside of the enclosed pool area that would be better if guests need to smoke. Perhaps management could consider making the enclosed pool area non-smoking, replace the broken lounge chairs and offer more seating. The pool itself was great, clean and child friendly.* Evening meal: This was the most noticeable decline. Almost every night offered a meal with cheese, with no alternative for those allergic or lactose intolerant. We had individuals in our party, along with other hotel guests who were unable to participate in the evening meal due to allergies. Previously, whenever the entree offered cheese, the salad bar was a garden salad with a variety of add-ons (including cheese on the side). The salad bar has since disappeared. During our last two stays, both the entre and salad contained cheese and was offered at least 3 times per week. It would have been nice to return to the hotel and enjoy a casual meal with our family and other guests after a long day out. Since you're provided with a menu for the week, we knew in advance when we had to eat out or pick-up dinner. Perhaps management could consider limiting the cheese entrees to once or twice a week (as in previous years) and offering a salad bar and breadsticks (without cheese).* Breakfast: In previous years, the hot breakfast was very good with variety on a daily basis, but would now consider it between average and poor. The variety has declined with the same offering on consecutive days. When cheese eggs and grits were offered, there was no substantial alternative. We've also noticed that Styrofoam plates were often substituted for real plates over the past couple of years at both breakfast and the evening meal.On the positive side, the hotel is in a great location. We loved that it was away from the busy areas and offered a quiet stay. The rooms are large and for the most part clean. The furnishings have seen better days, are not terribly comfortable and small for a family, but okay for the amount of time spent in the room. The staff was great - at check-in and breakfast.We will miss the Homewood, but can no longer justify staying at this property. The cost has also increased over the years although the cost to include meals may be used to justify the price increase, it wasn't worth the additional cost (as per above) as the meals lacked variety, did not consider allergies/intolerances and were overall substandard. We just returned from our vacation at the new property and have to say that we will not be returning to the Homewood. The new property was fabulous - larger suites, the pool area was clean and spacious with a significant amount of seating and the entire complex was non-smoking. We felt that we spent our vacation at a resort and were pampered. The best part is that we saved over 30 per night in comparison to the Homewood for the same time period.
0	Terrible. This place is a dump. The rooms are not clean. The beds are smaller than a normal double bed. The sheets and blankets have cigarette burns in them. The mattress in my room had been torn open with the springs exposed. The rooms all have terrible perfume smell. Only a few channels on the TV work, some don't have sound. The ice machine was full of mold. The overall area that the hotel is in a bad place. When the police are constantly outside in the parking lot it's a sign not to stay there.
1	Great Hotel. We were extremely satisfied with our stay. They have an excellent breakfast which we enjoyed everyday we were there. The rooms have everything you need for an extended stay. Everything you would need for cooking and serving meals, plus a full size refrigerator, microwave, stove and oven. Very comfortable room. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. Joy at the front desk was very helpful during our stay. We will definitely come back on our next trip so SoCal.Dear Rick, Thank you for sharing your experience at the TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium.With a mission to provide superior customer service, we take great pride in serving your needs and are delighted to hear that we have met your expectations.

0	Dollar-Sized Spider Living in Bath Tub. I decided, since I was dining at Scalini's and attending an Il Divo concert at the Cobb Energy Center, to stay nearby at the Renaissance versus driving home. In addition, I would meet with friends for brunch on that side of town the next afternoon. When I attempted to use the shower the next morning, I encountered a dollar-sized dark brown spider. Upon checkout, I mentioned my difficulty to the desk clerk whose attitude was dismissive. No one else was in line. After all, one thinks if there is one spider, there must certainly be others. I did receive a sorry, see ya next time response from the General Manager based on a hotel-based review. That does nothing after not having the ability to use the room as anticipated, not to mention my fear of spiders, especially the brown recluse spider. Please excuse me for having a reasonable expectation of being able to bathe without incident before going to Sunday Brunch. This incident made an otherwise pleasurable stay become a disaster. Also, I had intentions of using the hotel shuttle for my evening liaisons but was discouraged by the valet because there was a possibility of being disappointed with one van and 500 guests.I am very sorry about your experience and would like to discuss this with you in more detail. Please call me at your convenience at 770 303-3186.
1	Beautiful Hotel!. I stayed here for 6 nights. It is a beautiful hotel and the rooms are pure luxury. I wasn't impressed with the outside bar as far as service goes but they had a great deal for breakfast (only 7) which is cheap for Honolulu. The only other complaint was that in one of the restaurants in the hotel that has a bar you couldn't eat there. You had to sit at a table. I was traveling alone, therefore, I like to sit at a bar and have something to eat. It is in a safe neighborhood compared to some of the other hotels. If I want to make another trip one day to Honolulu, I would definitely go back there.
0	Decent hotel no HBO. Traveling across country and stopped for the night at the comfort inn Washington PA. Hotel is fine however if one would like to watch HBO forget it. No one could figure out how to get HBO to work in my room or my daughters room. This place is fine if you don't want to watch you favorite sporting event or... More
1	Great San Diego experience. My daughter won a charity silent auction for 2 nights at the Ocean Park Inn, and she gave it to me as a Christmas present. The guy at the counter was very personable, and check-in went smoothly. Parking is underground with elevators that took us to the 3rd floor. The room was modern, immaculate, and had a great view of the boardwalk and ocean. The included breakfast was good, especially the waffles. I was impressed by the friendliness of the staff....lobby, maids, breakfast assistant etc. The location is certainly the best in the Ocean Beach area. Great restaurants along the beach. If you have the , this is the place to stay.Thank you for the awesome feedback, and for participating in the charity event! We are glad you were able to come spend some time with us in Pacific Beach. Thank you for highlighting the many amenities we offer, and we hope to see you back soon.
1	Awesome Staff. Swiftly cleaned rooms just like most hotels. The staff are the best part about staying here. Shawn and Bianca N. are my favorites. Without hesitant, go to the moon and back to make sure you feel at home. It's hard to find that at other branches in Metro Atlanta. Bianca N. and Shawn are the Dynamic duo. Whether you need something as small as dishes to needing a laugh. They are the perfect ones.Chanel, thank you for making Extended Stay America -Atlanta - Clairmont a part of your travel plans. We are delighted your stay with us was exceptional and that our associates exceeded all of your expectations. I will share your wonderful compliments with Shawn and Biance. Thank you for being our guest, and we look forward to that next visit.Sincerely,General Manager
0	THE WORST MOTEL IVE EVER BEERN TO!!. I will never step foot in this motel and i strongly encourage anyone to not even think about staying at this place. It is the junkiest motel you will ever step foot in, their costumer service is a JOKE! My fiance and I needed a place to stay for 3 days, so we paid a deposit for those days, well... More
1	Great location. I have nothing to say against this accommodation. It was clean, it has great location and parking was also provided. WIFI in the room, comfortable bed, kind staff and they also have a room under supervision for your luggage at the day when you need to leave the room, but have a lot of time before you need to leave the city. Anyway, we were there just for sleep (who would stay in the hotel room when you are in SF!) and our sleep was without disturbance, so we (me - 23 my mum - 55) were totally satisfied :)
1	A better than average, but not fantastic stay. We were in town for a Lego League Competition at UTEP. We reserved the hotel for the pool. And of course, it was closed for maintenance when we checked in. It did open the next day, but the pool was why we chose to pay 40 more per night. Service was ok- not outstanding, but not bad either. Just normal service. There were only about 10 channels on the TV and nothing for kids (so I had no pool or TV for the first night after a long day of work and traveling). But the hotel is close to a shopping center and not too far from UTEP so it worked well for what we needed.
0	Sleep in the street...it's better than this dump.. I have never been to such a place in my life. The room needs a deep clean or totally revamped. Then we had noisy people in the next room. When I called the front desk the night receptionist did come to to tell them to turn the noise down but was ignored. We complained again only to be told that... More
0	Older and not that cheap.. Room was a little scary. Someone or something had been locked in the bathroom, it was all scratched up and grimy. Ewww.
0	Soooo Disappointing. We were traveling and we were looking for pet friendly hotels. We identified this one and when we arrived the lobby was empty....very little furnishings....however the lady at the desk was very friendly. We obtained our room and what a shock.....the person next door left the TV on loud for her pets. It was so loud that after thinking she... More
1	Great location for San Diego activities. We have now stayed here three times and really like this place. While it is not on the water, it is close to the Pacific and most other attractions in San Diego. The staff are well trained and friendly and we actually are offered upgrades due to our BW Ride Rewards status. This does not happen at most BW hotels. The rooms are nice but a bit dated. We love the property since it really seems like a tropical resort. We come to San Diego quite often and will certainly make the BW Seven Seas our property of choice.Dear PaulSchm,Thank you for being a loyal guest at the Best Western Seven Seas and for taking the time to write your wonderful review. We are happy to hear that you were satisfied with our friendly staff and our convenient location. We are currently going through numerous renovations throughout the hotel, including granite counter tops for the bathrooms, wood cabinetry, and upgrading various amenities. Thanks again for your time and we look forward to accommodating you again soon!Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management Staff
0	Needs updating. Needs updating. No microwave or fridge like shown in the photos.
0	Hotel was alright, but needs some help..... We stayed at this hotel because it was in Boone (Iowa) and we had a visitation there and a funeral the next morning. It was clean, but we did have some issues. The smaller coffee pot (5 cup) was nice to have in the room, but it didn't work correctly. The bathroom was clean, but the tub had a really slow drain. There was a clock radio in the room, but it wasn't set to the correct time (a personal pet peeve) so I had to set it - and it was really difficult to figure out and then it was bolted down to the table with only about 3/4 leeway on the cord, so we also couldn't move it out a little bit to be able to see the time if either of us woke up during the night (again, a personal issue). However, the breakfast in the morning was really well stocked...basic continental breakfast foods with 2 waffle makers...so not very varied, but was good. Staff was in and out making certain that there was enough food out and cleaning off tables that had been used. If you need to stay in Boone, it would be alright - as long as that is all that you are expecting. Otherwise, I would suggest staying in Ames and driving over since it isn't all that far away.
1	Exactly what the doctor ordered!. We went to Estancia for a weekend birthday celebration. I wanted to pamper her with peace and quite, a spa and pool day and some good food and drinks. Estancia La Jolla nailed it on every single level. Starting with check in - it was extremely quick and the staff was very friendly and helpful. As a matter of fact, one of the things that impressed us most was that every single staff member we came in contact with was genuine. Very friendly and caring. They all offered up advice on activities and food/drinks, and the steered us in the right direction each time. We had lunch the first day at Adobe El Restaurante - out on the patio overlooking the main garden area/fountain. Very fast service, friendly staff (Chris was our waiter) and the West Coast lobster roll was sooo good! After lunch we took an easy 15 minute walk over to the Torrey Pines gliderport, and we might have found our next bucket list activity. It was a blast to watch. Dinner that night at Mustangs Burros - really nice little patio area with a fireplace, but we sat inside and it was very nice. A warm and friendly vibe. Good selection of local craft beers. Our waitress, Nicole, was awesome! She was really helpful and really good at what she does. We ordered a few things to munch on that night....but I seriously think I would visit this place again just for the chips, salsa, and guacamole. Some of the best I have had anywhere - really fresh and lots of taste. The next morning she went to the spa for a massage and to use the steam room. she was very pleased with not only the quality of the massage, but the quality of the facilities and the friendliness of the staff here. She came out to the pool like jello afterwards. I rented a cabana at the pool for the day. I wish I could remember the servers name that helped us, because she was great too! she took excellent care of us and made sure our adult beverages never ran dry! They have a small pool bar/sitting area and a barbeque where the chef cooked up some yummy, tender carne asada. It was a very relaxing atmosphere. We ordered room service that night, and they got the food to us fresh and very quick. I will say this - we have stayed many places that are 4 star resorts, a little on the pricey side, spa resorts, etc. and sometimes you can tell when the staff is treating you well because they have to. They just seem so phoney about it, and it just seems fake - takes away from the experience. The Estancia property is beautiful, the close beach location is nice, the food is great....but the staff and the way they treated us will bring us back to Estancia La Jolla. They made us feel like family and made sure we were smiling at all times. We found a new get away location!Dear BCreview,Thank you for choosing to stay at Estancia and for taking the time to share such a detailed review. Were so happy that you had such a wonderful weekend and love hearing how you enjoyed the cuisine from our various dining options, had a relaxing day at the pool with your private cabana, and that the spa was such a wonderful experience for the birthday girl. Furthermore, to hear that the genuine hospitality of our staff made your stay such a marvelous one is a true delight. We appreciate your comments and will be sharing them with the staff at the resort, and especially with Chris and Nicole. Thank you for your excellent rating. We look forward to welcoming you back to Estancia soon well have the chips, salsa, and guacamole ready for you!
1	Bricktown Central Plaza Hotel is Impressed, totally!. A trip to Oklahoma City wasnt really part of my vacation itinerary, but being from the neighboring state me and two of my friends decided to check out OKC anyway. For some reason we zeroed in on Bricktown Hotel, but boy, did we make the right decision! It was just awesome. We were kind of budget travelers, but we got more than we expected. The friendly staff and the great room facilities really impressed us, as did the great summer weather that greeted us whenever we went exploring the city. We enjoyed the complimentary breakfast too. OKC really made us feel welcome, and Bricktown was just rocking. But were it not for Bricktown Hotel, I wonder whether wed have had such a marvelous time.
0	Roaches. Rudeness. Regret.. This hotel is perfect for being close to everything, but that is all it is perfect for. We had a cockroach in our room the last night we stayed there, and thank god it was the last night. They clearly do not have a pest control contract that treats the place for roaches regularly enough. I could see the lights... More
1	Place close to home. We missed our connection at PHL airport, and the fist thing we did was to find nearest hotel and were so glad that Hampton is just around the area. It is not just the brand we are after with Hampton or any Hilton Group hotels, but most specially the staff, from the airport shuttle driver, to the desk, housekeeping, i should say, every staff always welcome us like we were family, never had any problem eversince..Thank you so much for telling us about your recent experience at our hotel. We are so glad that you had a pleasant stay. We strive everyday to exceed our guest expectations. We look forward to serving you and your family in the future!Thank you for making it the Hampton Inn By Hilton Philadelphia Airport!Adrian Woods, Director of Sales
1	Incredible location, friendly staff, great deal. Definitely can't beat the prices here, especially during the Christmas season, this place was a steal! One minute walk away from the busy Union Square shopping district, the famous San Francisco cable cars and a five-minute walk to the BART metro. The staff were super friendly, including the housekeeping ladies and were very accommodative to my needs. Room was clean, modern, and very comfortable albeit a few creaking floorboards. Found it so hard to get out of bed every morning considering how soft it was! My room was facing the street, and there generally was a lot of noise late into the night (i.e. people shouting, laughing, cars honking etc.) but this is hardly the fault of the hotel. I would highly recommend this place to travelers on a budget and consider this a hidden gem in such a busy area!WOW! Thank you for sharing your 5 star Diva experience and choosing our hotel to spend the holidays in SF. We greatly appreciate your feedback and understanding when it comes to city noise. We hope to have the pleasure of seeing you again soon. Happy Holidays!
0	Nice location, Bad Customer Service. I travel to New Orleans for business about once a month and have the privilege of staying in quite a few hotels in NOLA, but Aloft was a standout, even though is it located very close to most attractions, the staff left us with a bad taste in our mouths. At check in, we were helped by Jermal and it was the worst check in experience I've ever had (even at Motel 6 they at least make eye contact with you and answer your questions). Very cold and not friendly staff with the exception of the valet guys. They were very nice and professional. Once we got to our room, it was clean and spacious. I did not find anything wrong with it except the infamous bad water pressure in the shower and the fact that we only had 2 big towels (All hotels I've stayed at have had 4 big towels) We signed up for the SPG Green Choice at check in so the extra towels would had been nice and we actually never received the 5 vouchers for making the green choice. Aloft has a lot of potential because of their location. I am giving them another chance in late May, hopefully this time they listen to our requests and are more customer oriented.Thank you for staying with us this past week. I would like to apologize for your disappointment during your recent stay with us. I know we certainly have not met your expectations and we want so much to gain back your trust and loyalty. The feedback you provided will allow us to address specific information and in turn provide a superior service for our guests both now and in the future. It is unfortunate that you had a negative experience but we look forward to having you back here with us in May so we can show you how we have used your feedback and show you the hospitality our talent is truly made of!If I can do anything in the meantime, please contact me directly at Dixie.Kraussaloftneworleansdowntown.com.
0	Restless Night!. There was constant noise through out the night from noisey doors to guests talking loud. Sort of feels tile an apartment community. Certainly not my type of place for a good night rest.
0	Poor Condition. The ceiling was dripping water onto my broken toilet. The place is in desperate need of renovations. It was clean as it could be for the condition it was in.
0	Horrible. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone .. Room was not clean .doors were creaking. beds not comfy.. water in the sink was so poor that it takes minutes to get brush . very bad
1	Wonderful staff. I had the pleasure of visiting this hotel when visiting my daughter who was staying there for training. Yes it is older and halls are a bit dingy but all areas I was in were clean, The decor is very interesting and fun. Pool area is beautiful with private cabanas which you never see at a hotel of this size. Whatever the hotel lacks in appearance is easily made up by the fantastic staff, Everyone from desk, to van drivers to restaurant personnel were wonderful and so accomodating. Shuttle will take you anywhere within 7 miles so we did not ever use a cab or uber and got to many good restaurants as well as the beautiful Galleria mall, however, it does not go downtown. Would definately stay there again,Thank you for providing an honest and fair review! Our pool and cabana area is amazing and our guests always rave about the accommodations. We appreciate your comments regarding our staff and have shared your feedback with the team. We look forward to seeing you again soon when your travels bring you back to North Dallas.
1	Enjoyable stay.. My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights because of the close proximity to Moscone Center, the art museum and great shopping, and of course because of the reviews on Trip Advisor. (How did we ever travel before Trip Advisor) Loved our time here. We requested and were given a quiet room - on the 17th floor. Everything about the St. Regis is stylish and modern (though not as great as the St. Regis in Manhattan). I loved the TV in the bathroom. Minor annoyances - the tv remote didn't work - probably dead batteries there was no price list for the overpriced wine in the wet bar - it took 20 minutes to have one sent up the electronic control center on the nightstand acted up a few times, turning the lights on in the middle of the night and I find it annoying to be charged extra for the wi-fi use (15/day). Regarding a couple comments posted earlier about the hallway carpeting, I loved it - a really fun design element. (will post a photo of it) We had the best meal of our stay in the hotel restaurant. The lap pool was warm and beautiful and empty - unfortunately I forgot my suit. Too bad the spa didn't have a basic suit to sell, like they do in some hotels. I would happily stay here again. By the way, San Francisco,what's up with the homeless people on your streets I've never seen so much panhandling and yelling and screaming and craziness and was actually afraid in some situations.
1	First choice for any return visit to San Diego. I booked our room through Expedia and was able to get it for 80+ dollars per night. It was a great price for such a trendy and romantic place to stay!The room and bathroom were not only aesthetically pleasing in design, but had good quality beds, linens, curtains, etc. and were extremely clean. I loved the bathroom with its large mirror, wide bath (the shower was heavenly with strong hot water), and colorful blue tiles on a whitewashed wall that simply says Mediterranean to me.The hotel has a great restaurant we did not get to try out, but it was within short distance of great restaurants and bars, the trolley station, and a CVS on the next block. The heated pool and lounge on the rooftop was terrific as well!
1	Gracious Hospitality. Just a 1 night stay after Thanksgiving with Family, and we were so impressed with the gracious service and beautiful amenities. The most attentive and delightful staff we felt like we were guests in a warm home! The food was delicious (best fish tacos!) Would absolutely return again!Thank you so much for your review. We have shared your kind words and positive feedback with the entire team. By the way, we launched a Facebook contest last week and we are giving away some spectacular Estancia prizes! All you have to do is become a fan and enter to win! We cant wait to welcome you back, but in the meantime we wish you a happy and healthy New Year.
0	Expect that your reservation will not be honored. It s bad hotel with terrible and dishonest management. Expect to be without room if you arrive late. For them it does not matter that you have reservation, they just simply give away your room. Even though the Marriott policy requires hotels to provide compensation in case of overbooking, do not expect to be compensated for your trouble from this hotel management directly.Better find another hotel to stay.Dear Ms. Dina,Thank you for taking the time to tell us about your experience with us, unfortunately we have fallen short of your satisfaction. I want to personally apologize for not having a room for you. When ever the hotel over sells we always set up other accomodations for the guest we have to walk to another hotel, we pay for their room and parking and if needed we will pay for their transportation as well. This is not something that happens a lot and we try to catch the guest before they arrive, unfortunately there wasn't a phone number nor an email address on your reservation. If you ever decide to come back to Buckhead area, I hope you will give us a second chance to make it right.
1	Trip Advisor. Excellent place to stay, It is convenient to the Philadelphia Airport and offers 24 hour shuttle service. The room was clean and provided more than was expected with a refrigerator and microwave included which often is an extra, I am extremely pleased with this hotel!Thank you so much for telling us about your recent experience at our hotel. We are so glad that you had a pleasant stay. We strive everyday to exceed our guest expectations. We look forward to serving you and your family in the future!Thank you for making it the Hampton Inn By Hilton Philadelphia Airport!Adrian Woods, Director of Sales
1	Not to bad , but kinda Pricey. Located right next to Highway 2 in superior , Rooms are nice with updated HVAC units through the wall. Water is good , Beds are well less than okay. In need of replacing .. rates are sub par for what your getting.. they lack technology ( reservations which is what im assuming happend to the previous person ) service is alright .. however if you are in a smoking room dont open your windows they assume you have the heat on all the time and bug you about it like crazy. In the 2 weeks we s...view moretayed they were calling us almost daily its annoying your treated like a child !, Aside from all that ive seen some bad motels and this one lives up to what motels should be , inexpensive , but still decent ... just look past the olive green and enjoy the massive water pressure in the shower ( really it sounds and feels like a water fall ! it has to be like 5GPM )view less
0	Old and dirty. Stayed 2 double beds suite for 2 nights. The location is good however, it was not worth for almost 200/ night. Overall, this hotel is so old..it needs some update on furniture, carpet, kitchen and bathroom. Bathroom was so small and dirty hairs on the bathtub and spider webs on ceiling... Carpet and furniture were so old and sticky. Gas stove wasn't working. Pots and cooking utensils seems like it's from someone's garbage. We booked this hotel for kitchen but we had to go out to eat...and there is only 1 restaurant near by...
0	Not Impressed. Stayed at the JW Marriott several times now as it is in a very convenient location and close to Houston's, however I think it is a dump the more I stay. This last time, the price increases from one amount to about a 100.00 more in 2 hours when I went back to book. Then I get a room with a shower/tub combo that I specifically said, I don't want. My morning shower was a nightmare to say the least. The water only trickled out of the faucet as the handle was off in my hand. Seriously I could not even shampoo my hair. I was livid. Pictures attached as when I say trickled I mean that may be an exaggeration as it was only basically dripping. The rooms are really a dump. Last time the air did not work and the filter looked to be about 10 years old. This room had air that worked so well it sounded like someone was in the duct work banging to get out, seriously I turned the air off to get some sleep. The decor is very modern and updated and truly looks nice. I just expect the room to be comfortable in a JW not falling apart. Very unhappy with this hotel. Moved over to the AC from now on.Thank you for your recent visit. I am sorry you were disappointed in your stay and the with housekeeping issues you described. Rest assured that I have followed up with our staff for immediate correction. I am not sure what may have happened with the rate increase you mentioned. If we were close to sold out there may not have been a general room available any longer and only our Executive floor rooms. I would appreciate the opportunity to speak with you more specifically and hope you will feel free to call me directly. We would love the opportunity to regain your trust and confidence. Thank you for letting us know.
1	Perfect, clean, friendly. Stayed here for business 1 night in December 2013. Arrived late at night but received a warm welcome and smile from the young lady at the front desk. Promptly gave me my key and off I went to rest and relax. The room was spacious, clean and smelled nice. My favorite part about staying in a Hilton hotel is a Keurig coffee maker. It's like home away from home. The room had a mini fridge which was nice. The bed was comfortable and helped with a good nights sleep. Would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again. Near the hotel is a Walgreens and a Starbucks went to both places.Dear Guest dlmyvette, I would like to thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to write about your experience during your stay at the Hilton Garden inn Orlando Airport. We are constantly monitoring the performance of our team member to make sure our valuable guests as yourself is welcome with an efficient and pleasant front desk procedure that provides the accommodations and service you expect. We want our guests to be met with a well-trained staff that puts guest comfort and satisfaction before everything else. We are looking forward to welcome you again. Sincerely,Alex BlancoGeneral Manager
0	Hotel was close to the Inner Harbor. There City of Baltimore was having a water problem because of the extreme cold temps. The desk staff did not tell us at checkin that we may have a water problem in the room. We first found out about this not having water in the toilet, That was eventually rectified but we did not have any hot water. After unloading a family ( 6 and 3 year old) in the desk staff told us to go to dinner and there SHOULD be hot water when we return, No t want to risk that option we ask for a refund and that we woudl be leaving. The desk staff was reluctant at first to give the refund but when I insisted because they could not guarantee hot water they finally did. They failed to understand that a hot water issue was a hotel problem not a City of Baltimore.
0	SCAMMER's. I made a reservation in June and cancelled the reservation at least 2 weeks in advance of our reservation. The hotel charged my credit card indicating that I did not cancel the hotel room. This was absolutely false. I cancelled the room and gave them plenty of notice. stay away from this unethical hotel.
1	Best Western - Who would have thought. So having just come back from a 2 week vacation in Maui, we needed to find a place to stay for a 20 year anniversary wine tasting weekend for a friend of mine. Didn't have much time and found this property, which was relatively close to downtown Napa and the other wine tasting events. I have to say in all honesty, we weren't thrilled about the prospect of staying at a Best Western, BUT, it turned out fine. The property looks as if it has been renovated recently, rooms are very clean/nice and the location was solid. If you need a place to stay in the Napa Valley without completely breaking the bank, this isn't a bad option. Don't let the BW name fool you. Guess Premier means something. :) Also, if you're looking for great wine, check out the Backroom in downtown Napa. Dan has a tremendous selection of wines that you won't find other places. Also has tremendous knowledge.
1	If you come to the Big Easy with a dog, this place is perfect!. The staff is very welcoming to both you and your dog. You are right on the streetcar line and there are plenty of safe neighborhoods around the hotel to walk your dog. I would highly recommend it. I am a local and stayed here during a house emergency for two weeks. They made a bad experience bearable until I could get back into my house. Thanks so much!V2885MQkarenv, Thank you for taking the time to review our property. We are so happy to hear we were able to ease the transition for you. Please feel free to stop by and see us anytime!
1	Like Old Friends. I have to say this hotel more than fit the bill for my five night stay in Phoenix. The valets were always very helpful and prompt (one of them was a hoot). The front desk staff was very nice and helpful. Two of the ladies (one in the morning and one in the evening) always asked about my day and were impressed with everything I had been to see. My room was spacious and the bathroom was a bit strange in its layout (sink extends from outside into the shower area), but it grew on me. They gave me plenty of pillows and the bed was comfy My only issue is that the walls are a little thin (or it could have been the connecting doors), cause I could hear my neighbors very clearly a few times. The hotel is located right near US-10 and is in walking distance of the Phoenix Art Museum and the northern part of downtown. Sad to leave but overall a great stay.Hi jehenson81!Thank you for sharing your experience with us. I'll definitely share you accolades with the rest of the team. I know they'll be thrilled to hear your kind words. I'll also share your feedback about the rooms with connecting doors with our design team. Next time you book your reservation, please reach out to me at mrykalskyfoundrehotels.com and I'll make sure you are set-up in a room without a connecting room. We hope to see you again soon!Thanks!
1	A great stay for patients and tourists. My husband and I along with our two children, 5 and 2, stayed here for a short weekend get away. It's very easy to get here by any mode of transportation. 10ish for a taxi from downtown, three blocks from pink line and four block to the bus that will take you to the museums. The neighborhood is quiet with great food just a couple blocks away. The front desk staff was great with directions and the shuttle driver will take you anywhere within about a mile of the hotel. They are all very accommodating and helpful! While there is no pool or great views this hotel is incredibly comfortable, clean and easy to get to. Our family will probably stay here again!travelindreams,Thank you very much for staying with us this month we are very appreciative of your business. It is always nice to hear when our Guests enjoy the accommodations and service that we provide them, and I will be sure to share your kind words with our entire staff. We look forward to welcoming you and your family again in the near future, and until then we wish you all the best.Adam NemirowHotel Manager
1	Great Stay for Our Getaway. My husband and I decided to go down to Hampton for a weekend over Valentines Day. We had a great stay at the Hilton Garden Inn. They were all very friendly and we got in real late on our first night and the check in process was smooth and stil friendly at 1:00am. I was glad to know that I was receiving the same service at 1:00am checking in as I would have during a normal check in hour. The room was so comfortable and clean. We loved our stay and it was close to all the near by attractions.
0	old place. We have stayed at this hotel several other times and it has not improved. There are not many in the area and a football game at Penn State that weekend filled those up and raised the price quickly. This hotel is old, run down and lacks many amenities, but we slept there only and were gone during the days for... More
1	Good for Business Travel. I needed a hotel for a last minute business trip during the MWCA convention. I used HotelTonight to reserve this and paid 480/ night as that was actually decent during this peak week and lack of notice. Some of the reviews on here made me concerned, and after my stay prompted me to make an account so I could leave a review. Overall, a very decent place. Room was clean, bed was comfortable, and bathroom very nice. The toilet and shower are in the bathroom, the sink was outside in the room. I saw some reviews complaining about this, however was no big deal at all to me. Shower seemed newer than the rest of the room. There's a Starbucks connected to the hotel which is very convenient for picking up a team coffee order before heading to Moscone. I also dropped off my laundry in the morning my first full day and received it back in my room that evening after returning from a busy day. They also have a 24 hour gym which has an elliptical, free weights and some equipment. Gym was clean and overall equipment new. Would stay here again! Thank you for the great comments on your recent stay with us! We are pleased to hear you were surprised by your pleasant experience with us and enjoyed our central location and amenities. We hope to welcome you back next time you are in SF.
1	Carlos to the Rescue!. I wanted to put in a review to give credit to a wonderful employee that came to our rescue during our stay :-).My family and I stayed at the Sheraton Suites Orlando Airport this past weekend. The suite was beautiful! My 4 year old girls enjoyed playing house with the divider doors between the bedroom and sitting/living room. Unfortunately while they were playing they lock themselves in the room and my husband and I were unable to open the doors. While my girls were screaming in terror (thinking they were stuck forever) my husband called the front desk for help. Within 60 seconds Carlos Vecco (a maintenance worker) was knocking at our door. Carlos advised that the doors do not lock and we just had to give them a good tug. (Shame on my husband and I for not giving them a good pull). But we are so thankful for Carlos coming up so quickly! We thanked him for his assistance and said goodbye. In about 5 minutes Carlos returned with a beautiful courtesy package of treats for my girls. What a sweet man! Thank you Carlos! We appreciate everything you did! I hope somebody from Sheraton Suites Orlando Airport reads this and gives you the credit you deserve!!We truly appreciate you taking the time to write such a wonderful review and it was a pleasure to share your kind words with Carlos! Please visit us again soon!
1	A Weekend Stay. This hotel is a rare exceptional for my wife and I to find every aspect of our stay to be rated as 5 star service. The staff was extremely friendly and professional. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. We both slept very well. Our stay included breakfast and the food was excellent. The fruits were fresh and the chef served up a delicious egg white vegetable omelet. Our server Dee was impressive with her skill set (yes there is an art to this) in table etiquettes. All valet service personnel were courteous and offered assistance with direction as we'll as bottled water as we ventured out into surrounding communities. We will definitely stay at this hotel again!
0	HORRIBLE. LOOK.. i have stayed in many places:This place is the WORST PLACE I HAVE EVER STAYED IN.IF you are a basic backpacker that does not care whatsoever about elemental hygene, and are planning to be absolutley drunk whilst here..then I recommend this place. However, if you are a normal human being and expect clean sheets, and not pubes stuck to walls and absolutley filthy carpet that trust me you can SMELL has NEVER BEEN CLEANED..and just a HORRID room full of bed bugs, then you will not want to stay here. Dont spend your money here. The people running this place would NEVER pass a health inspection..absolutley never. And i will be complaining. Because since I have been back I have had rashes all over my body. I just cant believe that people can get away with a place like this.try other hostels, we saw other nice ones whilst there. The bathrooms have full hairs in sink, and half eaten food everywhere..it was just a nightmare. ANY place should at least have clean sheets and not sheets filled with stains, and all different old sheets that had never been washed. A complete disguiting example of a hostel. Apalled. Oh and if you see good reviews..TRUST me its because the writers are proably backpackers (that are prob 16 and have never left home) and were absiolutley drunk and looking to party and they stayed here because they got free beer. BIG excitement..beer is like 5 bucks..go buy some and stay somwhere descent. Thats all
1	Excellent hotel for Seattle tourists. If you're not a Seattle veteran, you need to know that there are 3 main downtown neighborhoods. The old city by Pioneer Square in the south, the heart of downtown near the Pike Place market, and the northern neighborhood near the Seattle Center (Space Needle). While the heart of downtown has traditionally been the best neighborhood for tourists to stay in, the ongoing revitalization of the Seattle Center area has somewhat shifted this equation. Personally, for tourist purposes, I like the Seattle Center neighborhood just as much -- primarily because it's a little less corporate, a little more casual, and has ready access to many of the best museums (like the EMP across the street from the Hyatt). It's also only a 20 minute walk to the Pike Place market from the Hyatt House, and they offer a complimentary shuttle service, too.In this context, the Hyatt House is a grear place to stay if you're OK with the Seattle Center location. The hotel is new, and has a nice modern vibe. Since it's an extended stay brand, rooms at the Hyatt House are large. For this particular location, they also made them stylish. As a Hyatt Gold Passport Platinum member, my family was upgraded to an extremely comfortable one-bedroom suite facing the Space Needle. Breakfast is well above average for a free hotel breakfast, My only complaint was that the omelette maker was completely overwhelmed, and it could take more than a half hour to get an omelette (the buffet food had no delays). It's a nice touch to offer omelettes, but it doesn't work unless they can be made efficiently.The shuttle bus can also be a bit of a mixed blessing. In rush hour traffic, the service can be quite slow. I'd recommend walking to downtown during peak periods.Dave'sreviews,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor. We value the feedback from our guests and are always striving to improve our guests stay. Please let us know when you return as wed love to welcome you back as our guest.Sarah Junge
0	Not impressed. The access to the property was not very well marked so it was very easy to miss the turn into it upon first arrival. The window to the room would not open as it appeared to be half of a sliding window. The wood around the window was OSB that was just painted. The door was very warped and drafty... More
0	How did this place pass health inspections HELP !!!. non english speaking staff, paint peeling from walls, no internet available, breakfast was cold cereal and old milk on a counter top, dirty carpet, very old furnishings, not a good area of town, no deadbolt or chain on door, bathroom window did not shut, spray paint peeling off bathtub. not worth more than about 10.00 per night. they have hourly rates too..go figure the illegal business must be keeping them in business.NO not a good value at all.
0	Older Building, but updated. 60's Era building, but updated with microwave, hair dryer etc. No elevator for the second floor.
1	A great choice for a well located Hotel in SF. 1st time we went to this hotel in SF. I was a little cautious with low expectations due to the decent deal i got online with them. Only good surprises: Very nice staff, used to deal with international visitors and making the effort to speak other languages. Rooms are a little small but their design is tasteful. We had a comfortable bed, enjoyed a quiet sleep with almost no noise. If the hotel does not provide breakfast other than Coffee or tea, there' s a chinese 'diner' type at the next corner that will fulfill your needs for cheap.I ll go back there for my next trip in SFDear NicoCT,Thank you so much for offering your comments. I do appreciate you taking the time to recognize our staff, the great deal you found online and to our convenient location. We hope your travels lead you back to San Francisco sometime soon.Best regardsLuis MoralesHotel Manager
1	Comfortable and affordable. I had a room on the 9th floor. Supposed to be a small room but in reality was very adequate with a king size bed. Comfortable, and total paid on booking.com was 88! I was walking distance to the Southshore train which I used to travel from Michigan City, Indiana. I arrived early, 10:45am, and I had planned to ask them to just hold my overnight bag, but they said my room was ready so I was checked in by 11 am! Wow! Every staff member was very helpful, and I enjoyed dinner at the Elephant and Castle restaurant affiliated with the hotel. Excellent food and beverage.
1	Great Hotel!. A couple of friends and I went to the NKOTB concert and stayed at the Drury. It was a very nice hotel, helpful pleasant staff, spacious rooms, and we LOVED the free drinks, and kickback! We stayed out to late and so we missed breakfast, but everything else was very nice! We did have a small complaint that our room smelled like smoke it didn't really bother us that much, but we didn't want to get charged for smoking in the room when we didn't, so we reported it. The guy at the front desk said he would have someone right up to deodorize it and credited us for our parking fee for the inconvenience. That was SO nice! By the time we got back to the room, we couldn't smell the smoke anymore and it was a fresh scent in the room. I will stay here again!
0	Worst visit ever!. I am a gold elite member with the Marriott brand. We stayed here earlier this month. I didn't have time to get around to making a complaint because we were getting things done for my mother in law's funeral. First off the first room we were given smelled like mildew. It was disgusting. So I went to the front desk and was given a second room next door to this room. It did not smell any better. So I was given a third room this time in the main building. So we move our things to this room. I brush my teeth and get into bed it was then 1:00am approximately. I lay on the right side of the bed and the bed breaks!! I am about 180 pounds why is the bed breaking I fall out of the bed and hit my head on the corner of the night stand. At this point I am beyond furious. I calmly walk back to the lobby and explain to the gentleman. He apologizes and I am given a fourth room. The next morning I go to down to talk to the manager but the manager is in a meeting and the lady at the front desk rudely tells me the guy from night shift comped my room what else do I want. I could've of choked the ignorant lady. So I checkout and move to a different hotel. A manager named Patrick calls and leaves a voicemail the next afternoon. I called Patrick back multiple times and left voicemails. Never received a phone call at all or email nothing. We have stayed at this hotel for almost 5 years in a row. It's the only hotel we stay at in Anaheim. This is beyond ridiculous. Category 6 this place should be more of an 2 or 3. I have stayed at nicer category 3,4,5 hotels. I will NEVER stay at this hotel again. Is this the type of name Marriott wants for itself Should I take my loyalty to a different brand Dear floydmcmillan2007,Good Day, Please accept my sincere apology on behalf of Towne place suites Anaheim, I am very sorry to learn that your experience with us during your visit was not up to your par . Rests assure that we are now working on the issue and trying our best to fix the problem and I would like to thank you upon bringing this matter to our attention. Your comments will help us serve you and our entire guest better in the future.We apologize for the annoyance/inconvenience that this may have caused to you.We continue to be committed to provide you and all our guests with the highest standard of service in the industry. We look forward to your continued patronage and wish you the best.I hope to see you again here in Anaheim Towne Place Suites so we can better serve you.Mary Angeles-ClementeAssistant General Manager
0	More than a little shabby. Based on the website I had high expectations for The Annex at the Chelsea. Maybe if I had booked a room at The Chelsea instead of the Annex I would have been more satisfied. The bed, as advertised, was comfortable, but that was about it as far as the luxuries promised on the website went. No bedside lamp or clock, a large blank space - complete with hooks/nails - where something had hung on the wall, a chunk of plaster missing from the ceiling in the bathroom, tepid, low pressure shower, unpainted section on the bathroom door where a mirror once had hung, no lock on the sliding door to the balcony. You get the picture. Would not recommend this hotel to anyone.
1	WONDERFUL location, great room, great price. My husband and I recently stayed at the River Hotel while on a long weekend getaway to Chicago. It is in the absolute heart of downtown, and VERY conveniently within walking distance of just about everything touristy (Magnificent Mile, the bean at Millenium Park, we even walked all the way to the Shedd Aquarium). We got a really good rate for the room. It was small, however was still cozy. We had a river view and a fabulous view of the word TRUMP (..tower across the street). The only reason I would rate this 4 and not 5 stars is the bed... was... not at all comfortable, and I hate to say that. Both my husband and I were not well rested the entire weekend. None the less, it was perfect for what we needed and we had a great time! Staff was super friendly as well.Dear Hillary W,Thank you for choosing to stay at the River Hotel. We truly appreciate you taking the time for your review as all feedback is welcomed. I am so pleased you found the staff friendly and were able to enjoy our prime location in the heart of the city. Thanks again!
1	Definitely worth the price!. I liked the proximity to the ball park. It wasn't a bad walk at all even with a toddler. There is a parking garage for 10 a day diagonally across the street. Even walking back from the ball park at night wasn't bad. The hotel rooms are smaller than the norm but good for the price! There isn't complimentary breakfast or anything like that but there is a cafe one block over. They do have valet parking as well and seemed to be pretty quick. The employees were very friendly. Checking in and out was a breeze-the desk attendant was there to help with the self check in.
1	A Special Place to Go. We went to Pantai Inn for the second year in a row, to celebrate our anniversary. It is a truly unique experience, not like any other hotel. We felt very welcome and special. The staff was so kind and generous. The rooms are clean, charming and filled with anything you may need. We will return!Greetings Gita G,Thank you for taking the time to review Pantai Inn. We greatly appreciated the honor and opportunity to welcome you back and assist in the anniversary celebration! We love knowing when our guests are celebrating a special occasion and doing all that we can to make sure its memorable. Day in and day out, the team here is devoted to ensuring our guests utter and complete satisfaction. Hopefully you will not make us wait another year until you return... All my best, Mike
0	Disappointed with Management. My family of 5 stayed at the hotel for three nights in March. It was a good location if you are going to the ball game or hockey game. The free continental breakfast was basic and generally fine except that the juice machine was out of order and they had no alternatives. The first day there were small cans of apple juice, but the next two mornings there was nothing. Why couldn't the hotel have purchased juice and placed them in pitchers to refill or purchase more small cans of juice The breakfast items were not re-stocked regularly even though there was someone in the area working.Upon check-out we found out that our young children had ended up going to a pay channel and we were charged for a movie that they did not know they were paying for (they just click the buttons) and did not watch in in its entirety. The manager would only credit one of two charges as it was only on for something like 5 min. Upon receiving my credit card bill, the charge was never reversed. There was ZERO goodwill. They should also have warning signs about in room tv charges or upon check-in with young children, ask the customers if they would like the tv purchases locked out.The two bedroom was cramped, but we managed to survive the three nights.Thoroughly disappointed and will stick with Staybridge Suites from now on and pay the little bit extra instead of the Marriott.Thank you for reviewing us on Trip Advisor. It is unfortunate that we did not meet your expectations. Our goal is to make sure that our guests are aware of the type of amenities that we offer. Our Continental breakfast offers several items from six types of cereals, muffins, bagels English muffins, yogurt, hard boiled eggs, oatmeal, a waffle station, and juice. We apologize that during your time with us we had an issue that was out of our control and the preventative maintenance service on our equipment failed due to an internal part malfunction. This issue has been corrected and we now have a new juice machine which was replaced quickly after this time frame. For future guest arriving with small children you can request to have all movies turned off in your suite to avoid this issue as movies watched past a certain amount of time cannot be removed. Just ask a friendly front desk agent at your time of check in and they will be happy to adhere to this request. We did try and assist you in removing as many of the movie items as we could. Thank you again for staying with us and we would love another opportunity to improve upon your last visit. Thank you for again for staying.
1	Perfect Seattle Location. The hotel is located across the street from the Space Needle. Its also within walking distance to Pike Place Market and other places along the wharf. The hotel is quiet. I never heard another person while in the room and virtually no street noise. Rooms are stylish and the beds are very comfortable. It has a mini kitchenette so if you there for a period of time it would be great. My only complaint is that the clocks in the room were still on Pacific Standard Time, not Daylight Savings. I did not notice this until the morning and was late for an appointment. I tried to change the clock but was not clear on the clock how to change the time. When I checked out I notified the desk that they should check the clocks in the rooms.David B,We are sincerely appreciative of your complimentary remarks on your experience at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown. I have shared your feedback with the team as we pride ourselves on the things we do right and how we can continually improve. Thank you for the feedback regarding the clock in your suite. Please know this is extremely important to us and we have our maintenance addressing this concern as we speak. I deeply apologize for the inconvenience this caused. Safe travels we hope to see you again while visiting the area!Sarah Junge
0	We will NEVER stay in Quality Inn again!!!. We will NEVER stay in Quality Inn again!!! My wife and I arrived at 11:20PM and no one was in the front desk. We waited for 20 minutes unattended and finally someone came to check us in. While we were in the room, we found one of the twin bed did not have blanket/comforter. We called 3 times and the last answer was the house keeper left and he would send us one TOMORROW MORNING. It was 1:30AM by then and we were all exhausted and decided to give up and sleep with A/C off.
1	Much better than expected. From the outside the hotel look like a older hotel but inside has totally been updated on the inside. Our room was very clean and was much larger than expected. The bed was comfortable and we had plenty of pillows. There was even and lounge area in our room. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The only thing is that traffic is horrible around there so either use the free shuttle of ride sharing.Dear Mr. Christopher P, Thank you so much for taking the time to share your feedback. I will definitely share this information with my entire staff.The Wingate by Wyndham hotel is looking forward for to your next visit to Atlanta please feel free to contact us for any request.Tremeil BooneAssistant Manager
1	Very Good. Older hotel but very clean. comfortable beds, breakfast was great. our room was very clean. pretty convenient to restaurants and UCF. Hotel was under a little renovations (painting and taring of the parking lot) but this did not interfere at all.Thank you for providing us with your feedback. I will start by apologizing for any inconveniences you may have experienced during your time with us, but we are recently undergoing some updates and renovations to the hotel. On the other hand, I am glad that the rest of your stay was enjoyable and we hope that you will choose us again in the future.
1	AMAZING hotel! Beautiful, traditional, treated well.. So lucky we found this hotel on Trip Advisor. The decor was all wooden and very traditional (right up my husband's alley!). And it was very old school. . .in a good way. The staff was very helpful with all of our needs (and we had a couple special needs as my husband recently was in the hospital). Our room was great, bed super comfy, pillow choices, etc. Can't wait to get back to Seattle!Thank you so much for the kind words. I hope your husband is recovering quickly and I am glad that our staff was helpful in making him more comfortable. We hope to see you again, under more pleasant circumstances. Thank you!Randall ObrechtGeneral ManagerSorrento Hotel
0	Trip home from Disneyworld. Don't know how this place has some many high reviews. The rooms were not well maintained or cleaned. The management photos are very misleading. See my attached room photos of what you really get. Sticky wet floors, sticky walls in the bathroom, thick layers of dust, blood or burn stains on the sheets, AC from the 80's that barely ran,...

1	Not bad -- terrible water though. Stayed just for a night on a quick business trip to San Diego. I like staying in the Del Mar area, since it's usually cheaper than downtown or Hotel Circle, and traffic usually not an issue getting in or out of the city. Plus there's easy access to Hwy 101 and all the beach communities. This is a standard Hampton Inn which means good quality, nice comfortable room and bed, nice lobby, etc. The wifi doesn't reach to the upper floors, which i like to stay in. Not a problem, as they have a hard wired connection in the room that was fine. Very clean place, didn't hear neighboors. It's very close to both I-5 and CA 56 bypass, but I didn't hear the highways as long as I had the fan/ac unit on. My only thing to comment negatively on was the water in the room out of the bathroom sink tasted terrible -- really loaded with chemicals that made me nauseous, even from just brushing my teeth. Of all the reviews I've done here on T.A. around the country, I've never noted this before and it was so strong and noticeable I had to mention it.
1	Stay At the Hampton Inn Suites. If you are going to Napa, you must stay at the Hampton Inn Suites. The hotel is very clean, very friendly, and the rooms are updated. Many perks like cookies. tea, coffee in the lobby during the day, complimentary hot breakfast, and a snack bar to take with us to San Francisco. Definitely want to stay at the Hampton Inn Suites again.Dear 48mimiy,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. Definitely staying with us we offer many other perks like 24 hour complementary tea and coffee, in addition to cookies and our on the run breakfast to go bags that are available Mon-Fri 6am to 10am, just swing by the front desk and the bags are available for all our guest. Thank you again for visiting and we hope to see you again. Warmest Regards, Serina Najar.
0	Keep driving!. We booked this room using Marriott points. Check in was chaos- there was one person at the front desk and she was doing several things at once. The carpet in the hallway is dirty and thin. The laminent in the elevator is peeling. The bathtub was dirty and the bathtowels are thin and scratchy. When we checked out the next... More
0	Never ever stay here. Upon check in our room was not ready. It was a non-smoking room, yet guests prior to us had been smoking inside the room. There was a cigarette butt in the corner of the room that house keeping missed. There was an inch between the outside door and the wall allowing bugs inside of the room. There were not enough wash cloths inside of the room for guests. The next morning my daughter fell in the bathroom in the lobby and hit her chin and hurt her wrist. The day of check out my daughter had hit her toe on the concrete car stop, causing us to go into the ER. The hotel overall was loud and dirty. Upkeep was poor. Poor lighting. We could have paid the same price for a hotel room at a Disney property!
0	Great location. Poor customer service.. Not pleased. Poor experience. Will definitely stay somewhere else next time. 7 day/6 night stay...zero cleaning despite numerous requests, no fresh towels or linens entire week other than towels/soap/toilet paper we helped ourselves to from nearby cart. overflowing garbage cans were finally put in hallway day 4.Dear RobinsU9085vk,Thank you very much for taking the time our of your day to review our hotel and share your stay with us. I very much appreciate the feedback and I am very sorry to hear about the poor costumer service you experienced. I assure you that your feedback is taken seriously and we will use it to better our hotels operations. I am happy to hear that you enjoyed our great location. Please keep us in mind the next time you are in the Seattle area. We would love to be given another opportunity to ensure you have a great stay. Please feel free to reach out to me personally. We do appreciate your business. Sincerely,Jonathan
0	Worst looking hotel in location. Air conditioning unit whined like an airliner approaching a landing-annoying plus wasn't very efficient! Mattress's have seen better day's ( or in this case - better night's ) need replacing. Our room was on the Interstate side (back of hotel) VERY NOISEY- actually thought at one point that the window was open. Ironing board leg's were severely bent - broke in half when attempting to close after use - which was difficult to use since it wouldn't lock upright!
1	Perpetual Great Experience. The staff and accommodations at the Orlando Airport Hilton Garden Inn are consistently excellent. I have been staying at the hotel for approximately two years on a regular basis and both the pre-arrival and the stay are a positive experience each time I stay the hotel.My staff and I thank you for making the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando International Airport hotel your home away from home. As a General Manager I was so delighted to know that we have succeeded in our efforts of providing you with exceptional service, clean and comfortable facilities again and again. This is the best compliment a General Manager can have. I would love the chance to meet you in person when you do return again. Looking forward to welcoming you back soon.Sincerely,Alex BlancoGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando International Airport
0	Disappointed. My wife and I stayed at this hotel for two nights, arriving on Tuesday 7 October and departing Thursday 9th. I was very disappointed.My reservation for this stay was confirmed in January 2014. It was prepaid, and the charge was posted to my credit card account on 10 January last. I selected the hotel partly for its location, partly because it offered the facilities and amenities I sought, and partly because of good reviews on TripAdvisor.When we arrived at the hotel on 7 October, the lady on the front counter told me the MasterCard I presented was declined, and requested another card. Since I knew there was nothing wrong with my card or account, I stood my ground. Reluctantly she tried again, and succeeded. But that was clearly not her first choice.I told her the reservation was prepaid, which she denied. She said it would be charged to my card. After I got settled in my room I went online and downloaded a copy of my credit card statement for the month of January (showing the charge for this stay), which I showed the front desk lady. Reluctantly she agreed and asked pointedly It has not been charged to your account here, has itOne of the amenities that drove my choice of this hotel was free parking, as advertised on the hotels website. What it does not say is that there are only 40 or 41 spaces, given out on a first come first served basis. When we arrived they had all been given out. Because we were staying two nights I was permitted to park on the street in front of the hotel, rather than off-site (the other option). Neither of those options fits what I understand when a hotel advertises free parking. (I was given access to the hotel's parking area for our second night.)When we reached our room we were very disappointed at its size. There was neither room nor a stand to open two suitcases one case occupied the armchair, leaving only the desk chair for seating. This does not conform with what I expect from a Best Western, let alone a Best Western Plus hotel. And at 161 per night I consider it over-priced, though most hotels of this standard in New Orleans seem to charge around this figure.On both mornings we were at the hotel, when I stepped into the bath to shower there appeared black grime on the bath from my feet this came from the carpet. I complained the first morning and asked that the floor be vacuumed, but the problem was still there the second morning. I consider that the carpet in that room requires a shampoo.Finally, on both mornings when we came to breakfast the four tables provided were all fully used. On the first morning we had our breakfast in the Business Centre on the second morning we waited until other guests left.On the morning of our departure there appeared under the door a statement which, in the light of the initial denial that the reservation was prepaid, could have meant that the hotel had charged the stay to my credit card on the day of my arrival. The lady at the front desk on departure morning clarified that, though I must say bringing a January payment into the hotels account on 7 October seems a strange way to keep books. But the total of this statement exceeded my prepayment by 4.92, and appeared to say this amount was charged to my card on departure. I hope and expect that no attempt is made to recover this amount. A prepaid room is fully prepaid if the hotels charges change between when the stay is prepaid and when the guests arrive, that is the hotels risk. After all, they had my money for nine months. It is not a charge that can legitimately be passed on to the customer.Bruxin,I appreciate you taking time to let us know about the issues you had with the hotel. I am very sorry about the confusion with the prepayment. We just switched out front desk system, and they have been working on it for about a week and a half! The system is not playing well with out credit card swipers causing declines, so we have new ones on order. I have refunded the 4.92 to your credit card. The city implemented a tourism assessment in April causing the difference in your bill. I do heartily apologize for the disappointment in our hotelMelissa AlbertGeneral Managermalbertstcharlesinn.net
1	Pleasent suprise!!!. Rooms and facilities are ok for such a low price range but what stands out is excellent service and amazingly pleasant and accommodating staff! I really felt service was better than at many 5 star hotels. I was reluctant to ask receptionist Amy to book me Mears shuttle not sure if such service can be expected for a low budget hotel. Not only did she do it happily she said she will follow it up. When I went to reception hour early and asked if all ok she said sure and showed me her reminder to follow it up. Amy Really took care of me and I am grateful for this. Alexandra at coffee shop is so sweet and pleasant you get a feeling she is an old friend. And coffee shop stocks all the basics a guest may need for personal hygene as well as food. Location is great!!! Near outlets, 3 minute walk to wet and wild, plenty of dinning options. Very grateful for staying here.
0	Chelsea Annex should be embarrassed charging for rooms. I heard positive things about the Chelsea hotel and booked a room for my anniversary in the Annex. I had no idea that this was a dingy, dirty motel connected to the the actual Chelsea hotel. We paid over 500 for 2 nights so it was not exactly a budget option. The room was the worst I have ever experienced.... More
1	A nice hotel with very good location. After a two week vacation in Florida we stayed at this hotel the night before flying back to Sweden. Of course, you can not compare this hotel with for instance Hilton Clearwater Beach Resort where we stayed for a week - but for a good night sleep before flying back via Orlando International Airport - this is a very good alternative. The staff at the front desk gave us our rooms very quickly, the rooms were nice and very clean - no problems at all. They had a pool and we could walk to either a Dennys or Tony Romas. The TGI is close but across the highway. We booked the shuttle and a very nice driver helped us with our 9 (!) bags with a smile and dropped us off at United. I would not stay there for a week while visiting the parks etc, there are better hotels on International Drive - for instance Hilton Garden Inn or Homewood Suites, but for a hotel close to the airport - this is perfect!
1	Wonderful Hotel close to UCSD. This hotel was delightfully close to the graduation ceremonies for UCSD (we walked!) Our room was on the small side and totally enclosed (no patio). We were in the last building close to the pool and spa. Sadly, the walk to our room entailed walking through long corridors of indoors rooms through two buildings. There was a beautiful courtyard area in each building but it was not designed so that you could walk outside in the lush gardens :(The valet staff was the most helpful. Giving us water and directions when we needed them. The staff at the front desk were cool and impersonal.The pool was very pretty and our son enjoyed swimming in the salt water. It definitely felt like an adult hotel and not very kid friendly.Thank you for taking the time to share your recent experience. We value all of your opinions and thoughts. We are pleased you appreciated our close proximity to the UCSD campus. Please come back and visit us again soon!
1	Hidden (In Plain Sight) Gem. My family and I were surprised at just how good this place is. Given its location right in the heart of Seattle Center and its affordability, we thought for sure something was amiss. Parking in the area is expensive, here it is 25/day with full in/out privileges in a protected garage. The rooms are spacious, with a kitchen (microwave, stove, full fridge/freezer, sink, etc.) with an elevated dining table. Add the spacious bedroom, bathroom, and sitting area and you have a comfortable place for four to stay. The full breakfast is above average but the real hidden gem is the H Bar. We ate here a couple of times and the food is outstanding. The happy hour features a good selection of 3 local tap beers and the place is never really crowded. I'm not sure the tourists know they can come in otherwise I could imagine thirsty and hungry tourists at Seattle Center walking the minute or two to here, having a beer and a bite, and easily going right back to the Space Needle. I searched for the H Bar on Trip Advisor, but it's not there. NOTE TO HYATT HOUSE: You might consider getting the H Bar added as a restaurant if you want to increase your business.Thank you for completing a TripAdvisor regarding your recent stay at our hotel. Please know that your feedback is extremely valuable to us and we will utilize your response to make every guest experience the best it can be. I greatly appreciate your kind words and they will be celebrated with the entire team. If I can be of any assistance to you, please contact me directly. We look forward to being of service to you in the near future. Best regards, Jonathan
0	Overpriced and extremely outdated. First time we had stayed at this resort, we chose this report for its location and it was one of the more expensive hotels so presumed it would be good !!!! Room was in very poor condition and very worn out as a lot of the communal areas were, air condition couldn't be left on as the noise was horrendous... More
0	Expectations set high, but no delivery. The location of this place is prime. The hotel condition, on average is nice. I found my room fantastic, with a kitchenette and living room. The elevators were old and confusing (only one went to the garage, but you could not call just that one and there were no stairs).Breakfast was average-- the scrambled eggs were really dry and so were the waffles/french toast.Some of the staff were kind and helpful, but many didn't seem to care and others seemed new. Maybe this location had a high influx of new front desk members at the time of my stay. There are two kiosks at the front desk, and a phone between. While I was checking in, the other kiosk was also occupied by a staff member assisting a customer, and another staff member was using the phone between to talk loudly to a service member about a customer who had not had their room cleaned in three days. This was concerning, distracting, and off-putting. This also distracted the lady helping me check in from doing her job.One night, we were awoken by a very loud banging noise coming from the room next to us close to midnight. The banging, accompanied by yelling, continued for several minutes. Worried and scared, I called the front desk, but the person who answered didn't seem to care about the situation and at first didn't offer a solution until I asked if there was nothing they could do, and they said they would send somebody up there again. The front desk staff member said the lady had been locked out by her partner who had deadbolted the door. By this point, the lady had been standing outside her room yelling and banging on the door for half an hour (by her account-- overheard when she yelled at her partner when he finally opened the door). I'm worried that the staff allowed this to continue for so long. What if the partner had been suffering a medical emergency, or had never opened the door Nobody followed up with us regarding this issue, which was disappointing. Had someone touched base in the morning and apologized for the inconvenience, I likely wouldn't be writing this review.Upon checkout, the front desk staff threw away a handwritten not eaddressed to me as a guest of the company whose conference I was attending because my partner was performing the checkout. Overall, I was really let down by my stay here. The rooms are so nice and the location is great. I thought the Hyatt brand could be trusted with providing a great, seamless customer experience, but it didn't seem like they cared.Hello and thank you for taking the time to share your experiences at our hotel with us. First, I offer my sincere apologies for the poor care shown to you by my team. We are in the process of training several new additions to our staff but this does not excuse the lack of professionalism and lack of interest in resolving your concerns promptly and with care. Please know that I have addressed your concerns with my team so that we can continue to improve our quality of care. If I can be of any additional assistance, please contact me directly.
0	One of the worst hotels I have ever experienced. First let me say what was good at the hotel. When I checked in the gentlemen at the front desk were very friendly but never saw them again. Second, the lady that did breakfast service every morning was very sweet and always treated us well. The bed in my room was also one of the most comfortable hotel beds I... More
0	Two Star Hotel. The walls between rooms are paper thin. Lots of noise if the room next door is occupied. Not too much light in the bathroom. A $10.00 cab ride away from the historic district downtown. The maids did not clean the room very well. Trash cans were not emptied. Heard they discharged part of the hotel staff. The lobby and breakfast were good.  An older hotel. I think, after this, I will bypass Holiday Inn Express hotels for a while.
1	Awesome. We had a quick weekend concert in San Diego and decided to stay at the Ramada based on its proximity to the venue and price. The staff here are incredible. They're friendly and helpful beyond the norm. Our room was extremely clean, quiet and had a hot tub! The whole stay was extremely enjoyable and we will stay here again when we return to San Diego.We always appreciate when one of our valued guests takes the time to provide us with feedback. It is particularly gratifying when a guest, such as yourself, acknowledges the efforts of our amazing team! We at Ramada Limited San Diego/Near SeaWorld, make every effort to give our guests a comfortable and pleasurable experience during a stay with us. We are happy to know that you were so pleased with all aspects of your recent visit and we look forward to seeing you again soon! Thanks so much!
0	Don't be fooled. NOT in Bricktown!. This hotel is not in a good area and under renovation. We were put in a room that clearly had not been renovated. Light bulbs burnt out or missing, the AC leaked and the carpet was wet on one side of the room, it dried eventually. Construction debris everywhere. This hotel might be habitable a year from now but I... More
1	What you pay for!. We got this hotel as part of a package. We were very nervous before coming, as we read some terrible reviews. We nearly paid for another hotel! When we got there, yes it need TLC but it looked OK. The lady at recpetion was nice and helpful. We stayed in room number 317. It was nice, clean and spacious room. It definitely suited our needs! Everyone is saying it is dirty- but we didn't think so. The maid came in every day and spent quite a while in the rooms.The pool was really good- a nice way to relax after a day at the parks!Watch out for people who post flyers through your door! Tell reception immediately- as they shouldn't be there!This hotel is very close to Universal- which is very good!
1	My Birthday Surprise. This place caught my eye by just driving by about 4 months ago. This week, my boyfriend booked a half oceanview room to surprise me for my birthday. We loved it. The staff are super nice and the entire property has such an eclectic ambiance. The rooms are amazing as they come with a fully equped nice kitchen, nice TV's, super comfy bed, awesome shower, etc. etc. It's a great place for families or couples. Great location - walking distance to shops, restaurants, bars, etc. The place is still expanding. I can't wait till they add the spa and return - hopefully for more than one night.Missly, On behalf of the staff here at Pantai we once again wish you a Happy Birthday! We hope that we were able to make it a special one. Keep in touch with us so that we can provide you with information on our expansion as we know you and many others are eagerly anticipating the addition of the spa to our already amazing property. We hope that you come visit us again soon. Sincerely, Shane Pappas
0	Stay home.. We only stayed one night,a spur of the moment trip. The price was cheap enough, and the young man at check in was nice as well. The room had a musty smell, the towel rack and toilet paper holder were missing and there just two hand towels. We spent the first ten minutes killing flies. Finally, I'm not sure my... More
1	Small rooms. We stay at Hampton Inn a lot. This hotel was pretty much on par with most except for a couple drawbacks. The rooms are small - not a lot of extra space at all. The breakfast room is really cramped as well and there isn't a ton of seating although we didn't have an issue finding a table. The rooms were nice though and staff was helpful. There are a number of restaurants within walking distance, which is nice. Fortunately we didn't spend a lot of time in our room, so the cramped space wasn't an issue. I'd stay here again unless my travels required a larger room.Hello,Thanks for reviewing our property. We truly appreciate you rating our property 4 out of 5. We take great pride in providing excellent customer service. We hope the next time you visit Atlanta, you choose stay with us again. Thanks!
0	Meth lab just hours before check in. Cheap comes with a cost. You must be desperate to stay here. Drug bust the day we stayed. Nice owners but wow. Everything is old, broken, stained and smelly. Never again. It is not worth the little money they charge.
0	We're not staying here next year. Low point in our AWESOME vacation.. Location, location, location. This is the main reason this hotel stays in business. We had the best vacation in our 8 days in Orlando, and the hotel room was the only thing that did not work out for us. The price was low, and we got what we paid for.We were recommended this hotel by a travel agent based in Orlando, who told us that the Days Inn we were looking at was disgusting. We did not expect the Ritz, but the photos on the hotel website are at least 15 years old and taken from the best possible angles. It is in a great location, it took us 21 minutes to walk to Universal, and it is a beautiful walk with wide sidewalks the whole way.At check in we were assigned room 207. When we entered, the carpets had wet spots, and smelled like urine. The front desk immediately gave us a key for a room on the third floor. This room did not smell, and we did stay in it. It was not clean enough for our standards, so we purchased cleaner and paper towels and spent an hour cleaning the bathroom and vanity ourselves. Toilet ran- had to giggle the handle every time to stop water flow. Shower was moldy, pipes were loud, and pressure/temperature would vary greatly during your shower.The bed sheets are too small for the bed, and completely threadbare. At least they seemed clean. The bath towels were rough and the size of large hand towels. We had 5 people in the room, but most days got only 3 towels and had to ask for more at the front desk. Rugs were nasty- we kept on our shoes in the room. Only one door key was assigned, and the plastic key would get stuck in the lock every time.On the positive side, the kids loved the pool, and it was cleaned daily. The pool area is a bit old, and the chairs are cheap, but the pool bar is adequate and serves decent food. You can use your laptop near the pool. Pool towels are available at the front desk if you ask for them- but they do not let anyone know this, and most of the other families were using their bath towels.Breakfast was spartan, none of the fruit or muffins they show on the website. Bread for toast, milk, OJ, and frosted flakes were the only options for the kids. Coffee was TERRIBLE. There is an IHOP within a block and about 20 breakfast buffets within 1 mile- use them if you want a good breakfast.From this location you can walk to so many restaurants, and can catch a bus to anywhere in Orlando. Try eating O'Charleys on Turkey Lake Road (1 mile away). They had great food and prices. Lots of great spots for ice cream nearby.Our family is planning to return to Orlando in 2011 and have found much, much nicer properties for only a slightly higher cost. Look at the trip advisor ratings and try to find a higher rated hotel. It's worth the extra cost, especially with the low rates that hotels charge in Orlando.Good luck, and enjoy your time in this spectacular city!
0	Dank, Dingy Desperate Feeling. I'm a big fan of Best Western Hotels, because the majority of them accomodate my German Shepherd dog, this one is no exception except the other reason that I like Best Western is because the majority of them are designed well, and are well maintained, and offer rooms that feel fresh and clean, the Best Western Mission Bay seems to be the exception to the rule. The main parking lot features a poor design, it is difficult to navigate when stuffed full of trucks, and other vehicles that should have been parked in the overflow lot provided to the side of the hotel. There were derelicts floating about the hotel and parking lot, which made me wonder whether my car and the contents would be there when I awoke in the morning, I was on a road trip back to Mexico with a full load and didn't really want to have to unpack an entire SUV late at night and have to try to piece it all back together in the morning. The room felt stale and just not clean, although I'm sure that it was, it just didn't feel clean, or look clean, the place is in need of an overhaul and I feel that I could have just crashed at a Motel 6 and left the next day feeling like I needed a shower just the same.Good Afternoon,Thank you for taking time to review your stay with us here at the Best Western Mission Bay.On behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations.I apologize you were unable to find a parking space by your room. We do have a large parking lot adjacent to the property were lots of our guest are allowed to park as well. We are always striving to improve, We would be more than happy to offer you a discounted rate in the future so we can have another opportunity to show you an excellent experience. I am confident that if given another chance we will be able to show you a wonderful hotel. Please feel free to contact me directly for your reservation needs. You can reach me at 619-275-5700 ext 393 or Lpradohotelpros.biz.Once again thank you for your review!Leidy PradoFront Office Manager

1	Great airport hotel. We spent 1 night here before a flight out of Atlanta.Pros:Super friendly staff. When we checked in the lady in reception was immediately welcoming and happy to answer my questions. Then the guy that shuttled us to the airport the next morning was just as friendly. In fact he got off the bus at the airport to unload our luggage and explained step-by-step how to get to the international terminal. Great staff!Breakfast: awesome! Sausage and eggs were delicious. They had so many choices!Room: huge room with great a/c. Two tvs and plenty of storage space. There was some dried soap on the shower wall that probably should have been cleaned before we checked in, but it's just soap, so no big deal. Also worth noting: I never heard an airplane during the night. I was worried that staying so close to the airport would be loud, but it wasn't at all. Park fly parking area is closed off and well-lit. Hopefully my car is safe. If not I'll edit this review to reflect any issues. Cons:We had an issue with the plumbing in our room. We were only there from 8 pm to 6 am so I can't say whether this was ongoing or resolved, but the toilet didn't flush well. Like it was almost backed up, but it would still flush a little. Also, it would be great if the hotel had a luggage scale. I would definitely stay here again! Con
0	You call this customer service. Manger at desk was very rude at check in, don't think he was happy to be there. When arriving to my room it was very smokey but was a NON-SMOKING room, was offered another room which turned out to smell a lot better, but the man at the desk was rude yet again and made me feel i was an inconvenience to him. Would not recommend or return to this hotel again.Dear Valued Guest:I want to apologize for the inconvenience and service that you recieved during your most recent stay. Extraordinary service is our goal to provide to you and every guest of ours. At your earliest convenience, would you please contact me directly so we could discuss and resolve this situation for you. I look forward to hearing from you and having the chance to make this right. Best Regards,Blake DoranGeneral Manager
1	Really good hotel for the money. Would recommend. Great hotel for price. Large rooms with good views. We had small toddler and he had room to play and climb--very spacious! Room was very clean and hotel staff was great. Nice breakfast (eggs, waffles, French toast, fruit, yogurt). Everything was great, but the pool. Pool was extremely small and was greenish in color. I was surprised at how small it was. Other than that, great hotel for the money and it is close to the inner harbor and National Aquarium. Don't valet, as they charge 42 per day. Garage behind hotel was 3 on the weekend and we parked there 20+ hours. During week it was only 14 to park overnight.
1	Great Renovation and Friendly Staff. I have to be honest that from the outside, the hotel seemed a little scary and outdated. Once inside, however, it was one of the most modern Marriott locations I've stayed in. The lobby area was welcoming and there were plenty of areas to hang out with colleagues in the evening. And the rooms were equally modern and larger than average. My only complaint was that the bathroom was extremely small. I highly recommend this location for small business conferences given its proximity to the airport. The shuttle came in very handy for conference attendees.Dear BFR1920, thank you for taking the time to write your experience while staying with us. We appreciate your comments and hopefully will see you again soon. Wishing you safe travels, Dieter Heigl
0	Okay hotel rude service. This location is a drive from any decent place to eat, or anywhere really, for that matter it's quite secluded. The woman who checked us in was quite rude, and had a noticeable attitude. Factoring in the location, service, and amenities, I could have gotten better for cheaper.
0	Disgustingly dirty. There were dead bugs on the floor of the bathroom and carpet. There was dog fur or some sort of animal fur on the furniture. There was a cigarette burn on the sheets. The room smelled like mold. The comforter smelled bad. I didn't see any bed bugs but I was paranoid about it all night. The bed was lumpy and felt like it was going to tip off of the platform. I could not believe I paid 100 to stay in this room for a night, but everything was sold out.
1	Great location, Great staff. From reading previous reviews, we asked for a quiet room, knowing that it would not have a view, but considered this a good trade. The room was, indeed, very quiet and clean. The few issues we had with the room were addressed quickly. Happy hour every night in the lobby was fun! The hotel certainly looks a bit tired in the hallways and could use some updating, but it is the staff that makes this hotel so very enjoyable. Location is awesome. We would definitely be back! Thanks to the Diva staff for making our trip so memorable and fun.Thank you for the wonderful feedback on your recent stay. We are pleased to hear you were able to get some great rest in our quiet rooms and enjoyed our friendly staff. Your review means a lot to us and we hope to have the pleasure of welcoming you back in the near future.
1	A Nice Stay. Overall this is a very nice hotel with well appointed suites. We were in town for a couple of family functions so we didn't use most of what was available in either the room or the other facilities that were offered by the hotel. A couple of comments an not really complaints are that the fitted sheet on the bed was put on the bed inside out and was not fitted very well to the mattress (it just looked kind of sloppy) and there were spatter marks on the wall next to the bed that looked like they could have easily been wiped away. The rest of the room appeared to be very clean. They were even steam cleaning the carpets in the hallways while we were there. All of the staff was very friendly. Each of the housekeepers we met in the hall always gave us a friendly greeting. The breakfast offered a good variety and everything seemed fresh. A buffet meal is offered Monday through Thursday but we were not there on those days to be able to comment other than to say what was on the monthly menu posted in the room looked pretty good. The hotel is close to the airport , about 10 minutes to Virginia Beach Town Center, and only a 15 minute drive to Virginia Beach. It is located in an industrial park and is conveniently located near numerous dining and shopping facilities.
1	Room 833. I have stayed here many times since 2005 I am never disappointed. The new rooms in the new addition are great. Really big and spacious. Plus the evening meal and the morning breakfast are a wonderful addition. After visiting museums and shopping all day, we didn't want to go out to restaurant. The evening meal offered baked potatoes, grilled chicken, pasta, salad, hot dogs chili. We put together a nice meal without having to leave the hotel. Then the next morning, we had a complete breakfast before heading off to the Aquarium. All the staff were very professional helpful. Thank you Drury Inn.
1	Business turned pleasure. I visited this property twice in the last 12 months. Needless to say, I was very impressed at the attention to detail paid by every employee I encountered during my stay. From the front desk to housekeeping, hotel staff never missed a beat. I will definitely stay at this property in the future.Of special note, the personalized notes of appreciation from Tina with housekeeping were a pleasure to receive by my wife and me both. Her thoughtfulness and personal touch made coming back to the room after a full day a true pleasure. She certainly sets the bar in professionalism with a personal touch!! Well done!Thank you Larry-AK for not only staying with us but for taking time to write about your absolutely lovely experience. We are very lucky to have Tina on our team and I could not be happier to see that her notes were one of the key highlights during your visit. I truly appreciate the feedback as does our team, we can't wait to welcome you and your wife back again soon. All my best, Shannon
1	Terrific Location marvelous staff. We arrived at the hotel a few days after a devastating thunderstorm had knocked out power to a large portion of DC, MD, VA. The hotel had opened up to refugees that had no power so they did not have a room with 2 double beds as we had ordered. They gave us a room with a king bed and a rollaway bed. It was cramped for 4 of us. But the hotel staff was indeed marvelous and went out of their way to make our stay at DC a very good experience. Excellent location with metro and a great shopping mall on site. Lots of fabulous restaurants within a short walk. My kids loved the hotel and their indoor pool. We will stay there again the next time we visit DC.
0	Very Dirty, Very Disappointing. I used Tripadvisor to review various properties at the Philadelphia airport before booking and the Fairfield Inn was highly rated so we booked. We were astonished to find that the reviews in no way reflect reality. I want to say first of all that the staff were professional, competent and extremely helpful, so this review in no way reflects on them. While the lobby and breakfast room were clean in appearance, the room was a completely different matter. It was shabby and filthy. The sheets and towels were clean but the furniture was sticky, the shower curtain had mold around the edges, and the chair in the room had multiple stains on the seat. The curtains and dust ruffles around the beds were very wrinkled and appeared to have been crumpled in a ball before being used. After noticing these things, I began looking more closely at other aspects of the hotel and noticed that the elevators were quite old and had not been cleaned well either. The hallway carpets appeared dirty and were rippled from stretching - they are obviously old as well and not kept up.This is the second worst hotel I've stayed in and I've stayed in a lot of hotels all over the world. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone or stay here or in another Fairfield Inn again. When you can't even sit on the chair in the room because it is so badly stained or touch the tops of the furniture because your fingers will stick to the top, it is pretty bad.Hello,Thank you for taking the time to provide your feedback. We take great pride in the service that we provide. Please contact me directly so that I may address your concerns immediately. Rest assured that I will go into every single room today to ensure we continue to reflect the highest cleanliness standards as this is extremely concerning to hear. We welcome all feedback in a positive manner even if it is not as favorable as we would like it to be. I look forward to speaking with you soon and thank you for staying with us while visiting the Philadelphia area!Yours in hospitality,Paulette Moore
1	great place to stay. Beautiful gardens, clean rooms, non-smoking, great kitchen, comfortable bed, quiet, close to really good coffee! and friendly and helpful staff. Near to where my student son is living and has a pool. Wish I could have stayed longer!Dear 773ericac,Thank you for the kind words, and thank you for taking the time to write about your stay. It is a big compliment when our guests take to TripAdvisor to share their stay with others.

1	great for price, brilliant location. im a bit late writing this but ah well, we went to orlando as part of our honeymoon last year, (20 may) we wanted a hotel near the main attractions and somewhere to sleep. this hotel was clean, the staff were very help full, its in a fantastic location....6 for a taxi to universal, r a 10 min walk. ..disney is a lot further away but we were not so interested in that. the staff were always helpfull if we needing information. the hotel is across from wet and wild, there is an ihop bus stop outside, plenty food places, and there are a few bus routes too.the only downside of the hotel was the breakfast, it was only toast and cereal....but to be quite honest there are so so many cheap food places around that you dont nee dto have breakfast in the hotelit is a busy hotel, there were a lot of kids there when we were, which could be quite annoying.....but everyone is there to have a good time!!! our room was cleaned every day and we got fresh towels....there is a plaque in the bedroom, if you want your bed stripped then you put it on the bed, we only done this once, and the bed was stripped and made fresh.......all the people moaning about not having a stripped and fresh bed everyday....do you do that at home i doubt it, so why moan about it on holidaythey have free wi-fi in the lobby and at certain areas by the pool.i would stay at this hotel again no bother, its good value for money, its a basic hotel and you have to keep this in mind when you go, if your looking for a good location, and a clean hotel its great!!! :)
0	Room Review. The room was extremely outdated and had a musty odor. The parking was not the best.
1	Low Budget but Convenient !. Convenient to many different places to go. Shopping, airport, Beaches, Museums, Eateries, Everything ! The staff is very helpful, Zaks Bar is a fun place to sit and un-wind, The PG Lounge is seperate from the restaurant and you can sit out by the pool and lounge outside as well. They open up the large BBQ for guests, poolside, for fun. It's an older establishment, but they keep it up, and it's just right for the budget -oriented person, or, family ,when taking those trips to the amusement parks. Pretty close to everything. Centrally located !Dear Thomas M M:Thank you for being our guest and providing us with your feedback. We appreciate all your great comments in regard to our centrally and conveniently located property. As you know, the Best Western Seven Seas is close to all San Diego has to offer. We were pleased to hear you enjoyed our very helpful staff including those in our infamous Zacks Bar. Our property is older however, we are continually upgrading both inside and out in order to meet the needs of our guests. We are also glad that you were thankful for the value you received while staying here. Thank you for choosing us for your hotel accommodations and we look forward to welcoming you back on your next trip whether for business or pleasure! Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff
0	Scruffy But Clean. We decided to try the Americana Hotel for a night. Pluses: clean room, comfortable bed, nice TV with lots of cable. Breakfast (free) was pretty thin: donuts/bagels, oatmeal or cereal. The room was much cheaper than anything else available, and there was lots of parking- for free! Most hotels charge 28/night for parking, so this is another big cost plus.... More
1	Great location. Wonderful stay, location was great, close to bus and trolley stops. Only a short walk to the beach. Rooms are good with a very comfortable bed and lovely view. I struggled to use the coffee machine, but staff were all very helpful. Great to have breakfast included. Wonderful and friendly staff. I would book at Waikiki Gateway Hotel again.Aloha,Our incredible staff and unbeatable location are just 2 of the reasons that the Waikiki Gateway Hotel is the place to stay in Waikiki. Thank you for taking the time to share your experience. Mahalo for choosing the Waikiki Gateway Hotel we cant wait to see you again.
0	Rats and dirty!!. We stay at this hotel every year same time for an event at Angel Stadium the 1st weekend in Jan.We never have issues but when it rains it pours with this group...We checked in and they lost our reservation because I had called on a re-rate. They changed the name on the reservation, they changed it from a one bed to a studio and raised the rate from 109 to 129 We booked in Oct but 1st of Nov they put up a disclaimer that the hotel is under remodel...but the disclaimer was not on the webpage when we booked. Remodel is an understatement its a train wreck. There was 4 or 6 couches piled up in front of a cargo bin just sitting there with some other ragged furniture and lamps in part of the parking lot.Our 1st room was nice but getting to the room was a mess, floorboards missing, walls messed up, the door wide open to the electronics closet which cant be seen by the front desk so anyone could walk in and create havoc. I am sure there is credit card info in those backup etc.It was late about 10:30 and we rented a PPV and then we hear something in the kitchen area and its a rat that runs behind the stove and now is stuck and screaming. So we go down to the front desk and then send a guy up to try and catch the rat. He cant catch it so they tell us we need to move to the other building.We do and its a bigger mess then the 1st building. There is black goop all over the floor in leading to the elevator and then in the elevator too, the 2nd building is old,smells and needs remodel bad. The new room is 2 bedroom but its hit and miss, way to much furniture, kitchen is dated, microwave falling down, dusty and dirty and about a 3 gap under the front door so someone could look in if they wanted.When we tell them the room will not work they offer to move us back to the 1st building but to the room a joining the room with the ratIt was just a trip hotel from hell which is really sad because its normally an ok hotel. We book next time at Hilton.Was really disappointed that management didn't reach out to us in till we contacted them.John Dominguez Assistant GM useless!Thank you for rating us on trip advisor as we are always looking to improve our hotel and do well by all of our guests. As most business professionals I was not available during the weekend while you were here at the property: however, we always have a manager on duty.As we are currently undergoing renovations, we have the challenge of insuring that our hotel continues to operate with minimal disruption to our guests. We understand that finding a mouse in your room can be an unnerving situation and tried to put you at ease for the duration of your stay. My staff did need to relocate you to another room so that we could have an external company resolve the issue which has now been rectified and make sure that you had a comfortable and pest free stay.Im happy to see that my staff offered you an upgraded newly renovated accessibility suite that did not have any adjoining wall or door to the previous room. We are sorry that you declined it. My understanding is the manager also offered to purchase a shower chair as the remaining 16 accessible rooms were fully committed. The Suite that you were relocated to was an upgraded suite as an additional apology for the issue that occurred. In my email to you on Monday after you had departed I explained that the renovation construction team working in the building you had relocated to did in fact make scuff marks on the floor from the tires of the dolly's that they were using to move the larger furniture out of the rooms to make way for the new furniture that we were receiving. As we placed you in an un-renovated suite for the final part of your stay, I can understand why you would feel it was out dated as the renovation is to give us a more modern and updated look and this suite had not been completed as of yet. As per Marriott standard the renovation information was available to all guests as of the beginning of October prior to when your reservation was made. Jeanette the Manager on duty removed your charges for the first night due to the mouse incident, while isolated, is unacceptable. We sincerely apologize as no guest should ever experience that. As you have stated, you have stayed with us numerous times and have never had any issues.The room you noticed with the door opened was awaiting a new air conditioning unit, there is nothing in this room that would present a security issue for our guests. We will also be purchasing some extra assistance chairs to accommodate past our eighteen accessibility rooms. again our apologies that your stay was less than perfect. We hope that you will give us another opportunity to welcome you again during the annual super cross event at Angel Stadium.
1	I love San Diego. When I go to San Diego I want to stay on the beach. This is my favorite beach Motel. The people at the desk are very helpful. There is a free continental breakfast. The rooms were quiet and comfortable. Our view of the ocean was great. There is a small pool and a little hot tub also. Parking only 10.00 night. The toiletries are nice. Across the street from Ralphs . Perfect for a few days just to chill at the beach. Many restaurants and bars walking distance. I have been there before and will continue to go there. Pat at the desk is very nice.We are so glad to be your hotel of choice when you come to stay on the beach in San Diego! We look forward to having you back soon!
0	Close to main strip. Not what I expected our room felt like it was in a basement damp and humid so much so that the bathroom door didn't even close all the way Window air conditioner sounded like a freight train kept us up all night Free breakfast and laundry on site were nice
1	A regular business stop. We have stayed at the Inn for many nights over the last couple of years as my business has taken us to Seattle. It is centrally located and is within easy walking distance to my appointments. We love the Inn!!The personnel are extremely friendly and helpful. The rates are very good for Seattle. The rooms, while dated, are great and comfortable.I would recommend it to anyone.Good Afternoon Karl and thank you for your very kind review! Please consider us your home away from home for business or pleasure. We hope to see you again soon in the near future, until then, safe travels!
1	Nice hotel free wine happy hour friendly staff. Would recommend for couples-close to a very good restaurant Nobb Hill cafe and walking distance to grace cathedral. Most tours will pick up at this location as well. Free printer ATM and fitness center all made our trip much more convenientDear Alexis,Thank you so much for your fantastic review. We love to hear about our guests enjoying the facilities so we are pleased that you left Vertigo Hotel with wonderful thoughts. We are also happy to hear that you enjoyed the Wine Hour we currently have. Again, thank you for your thoughtful review. We look forward to your next stay in San Francisco!Luis MoralesHotel Manager
0	Better book it cheap, if not good luck. This hotel is definitely not top notch. If you can book it cheap then it will provide you with a bed and a bathroom and cable TV. One thing that really pissed me off was that the wifi is extremely slow that it's almost impossible to use.So if you can book it cheap, good for you, if not, look for somewhere else.Thank you very much for your feedback, which is much appreciated. We are sorry that you didn't love our hotel, but we trust that you found your room to be clean and comfortable, and suitable for your needs. We are very sorry that you experienced issues with our WiFi, this is something that we are addressing with our provider, in an attempt to provide a better service for our guests. We would love to host you again when you are in the area thank you for your review. Best wishes, Hotel Management
0	Not very happy with the service.. Hotel looks very dark, weird smell 105 dollars per night. Complementary Internet and continental breakfast. Location is in French area very handy if u want to go out. Small pool of u want to swimming. 25 dollars parking.
1	PERFECT LOCATION FOR BASEBALL. Hotel is perfectly situated for Angel's baseball games as it is within walking distance to the stadium. Free packing. Staff was very friendly and welcoming. Had a two bedroom suites, which was very comfortable. Nice having a kitchenette, although we did not use it very much. Nice options at breakfast although the eating area could be a little crowded. Variety of eating options nearby.. Very good choice.Dear Harry, Thank you for sharing your experience at the TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium.

0	Overrated and obsolete in 2016.. The room smelled of old smoke and room freshener!!! Bare essentials for the stay... remote setting from the main building with parking unavailable nearby. Scary and totally disappointing!
0	Not recommended based on service overall hotel experience. We stayed at this Courtyard in Oct. 2007, and booked well in advance of our arrival. We used marriott.com to book the room, and reserved a room with two double beds and a balcony (the website lists details about each room type available).Upon arriving at the hotel, the front desk clerk (only one for a line of 5 parties checking-in) advised us that our room was XYZ. When I asked if the room had a balcony and two beds, he said that there were no rooms of that type left. We had a dialogue back and forth, and I said that I reserved a room with a balcony and two beds, and that's what I wanted to get, or else I would go to the Hilton Garden Inn, where I am a Hilton Silver member and spend about 50 less per night. The clerk pulled up the hotel web site and tried to insist to me that a specific room type is not guaranteed rather, they are just guidelines. However, I made it very clear that each available room type listed amenities specific to that room (i.e. double balcony room, XYZ square feet, balcony XYZ square feet, etc.). He was very insistent and offended me with his refusal to admit that, in this case, I was right. To make a long story short, the clerk accomodated us with a one queen bed plus sofabed room with a balcony. The importance of the balcony was because my friend smokes and the entire hotel is smoke-free otherwise. Why the clerk had not suggested this prior to our 15 minute debate is beyond me. Not a good start to this stay.On to the hotel property and facilities. There is plenty of parking. Even with the Mountain Dew/X games convention staying there, there was plenty of parking available, even late at night,. The hotel facilities are relatively new, with lots of bright light and marble. Rooms are decorated nicely, but are average in size. The bed was very comfortable I was told the sofa bed was not that comortable (to be expected, I guess). The balcony was definitely a good size, but overlooked the gas station next door. The bathroom was small, but had good water pressure and a massaging shower head.With regards to the Courtyard's location, I would not say it is unsafe. It is located in downtown Orlando. If you are intimidated by being in a city, then you will most likely be intimidated by the hotel's location. However, there is no need to worry about running into trouble in this part of the city. Simply follow normal night time procedures for being aware of your surroundings, as you should anywhere after dark. The biggest complaint I had about this stay was the noise level. Due to there being tons of teenagers staying here with the previously mentioned convention, we heard yelling and skateboarding in the parking lot at all hours of the night. We also heard other guests yelling out their sliding doors for them to shut up, and arguments ensued. This was around 4-5am. Hotel staff, where were you Someone needed to get this rediculous noise under control. The walls here are very thin, and banging could be heard on adjacent floors of the hotel.The air conditioner in our room would not cool adequately. Even on the high cool setting, it would turn off at about 72 degrees I would say. So after spending the day in the 90+ degree heat, we couldn't get cooled down well enough. And at night it was rather warm. Not to mention that the A/C could not drown out all the noise, because it was off most of the time. There is no constant cool option to override the auto thermostat temp feature of the A/C. Both low cool and high cool switch on and off based on the temp you select. So overall, I was not impressed by the service or general atmosphere of this Courtyard. I have stayed at Hampton Inns that are much nicer, with better customer service. This stay confirmed for me why I frequent Hiltons and their sister properties as opposed to Marriotts. I would not recommend this hotel based on my stay. There are many other fine hotels of this caliber in Orlando, so do yourself a favor and stay at one of the them.
1	VERY NICE HOTEL STAY WITH GREAT RATE. Booked one night for Sunday Memorial Day weekend, we found the lowest rate 110/night for holiday weekend compared to surrounding comparable hotels. The Cons: Hotel is oddly located behind the Residence Inn, across from the Doubletree, right next to the 56 freeway, gas station and Taco Bell, very small workout room and pool. The Pros: The outside appears bland but clean, the large inside lobby has a very relaxing welcoming set up, plenty of comfortable nice looking furniture seating areas, with roomy space and layout. Free Coffee and tea available all day in the lounge/breakfast area. Professional, welcoming customer service at check in and out, we were allowed to check in early about 0100. The included breakfast was very good, fresh and plenty of nice choices, great deal to be included in the nightly rate. There was eggs with ham, thick potato wedges, fresh fruit, tasty breads/muffins, fresh oatmeal, yogurt, cereals, juices, coffee, tea. Our room was roomy/clean, the ac worked well, bed felt great, nice linen/towels, freeway noise not too loud, good internet connection included. Free parking available in their lot and underground parking also. Within 15-20 mins. to La Jolla and downtown San Diego, very close to beaches. We were very happy and impressed with the service, our room, the hotel's large welcoming lobby setup, the wonderful breakfast, the great rate and relative proximity to other San Diego locations. We will definitely recommend and return to this Hampton.
1	Very welcoming staff. Stayed three nights on the way back to Phoenix Airport at the end of our holiday.The rooms were roomy clean but three light fittings didn't work, and neither did the TV remote.The pool was closed for one day when an underwater light fitting loosened and floated to the top of the water with electrical cables attached to the mains!!When visiting the breakfast area at 9.20am one morning, vitually nothing was left and it wasn't replenished. We had cereal and toast and that was it!!The redeeming feature at this hotel was Anthony on front desk. He was extremely welcoming, friendly and made us feel at home. I would stay there again because of the service given to us by him.
1	Great Hotel Centrally Located. Stayed there for a conference (Great conference area by the way) and found the room spacious, very clean and comfortable. Absolutely love the bed - I have bad back problem and I was able to sleep all night. The food in the hotel dining and bar areas is very good and a little pricey as in any hotel. The hotel is in a central area where you can walk a short distance to the Gaslamp area (a historical area with shopping and restaurants) the bayfront where you can visit the Maritime Museum where you can enjoy hopping aboard sailing ships, pilot boats, submarines and explore the museum or visit Little Italy, and well it is a great hotel with a helpful staff. We really enjoyed our stay.Bobby S - What a great review! I am delighted to see that we exceeded your expectations. We are a perfect choice for business or pleasure while visiting San Diego. Centrally located between the Gaslamp, Little Italy and the harbor, we are walking distance to great shops and dining. Here at the Westin San Diego, we know that great service is what brings our guests back. Our Westin Heavenly Beds are the best in the industry. They definitely help you leave feeling better than when you arrived. Did you know you can purchase the exact same bed at Nordstroms, Pottery Barn or online at Westin at home. We look forward to welcoming you back the next time you are in town.Remain Well,Alyssa Turowski
1	Family trip. The hotel is in a great location walking distance to most areas, a good choice of restaurants close by, the staff were very helpful my room as very comfortable and clean and the bathroom was big enough I would defiantly stay here again in my next tripI'm so pleased that you enjoyed your time with us! Isn't it lovely walking around and checking out some of the local attractions After a long day of sight seeing it's great to hear that you enjoyed coming back to relax in your room. Hope we'll get the pleasure of seeing you again on your next trip to the city!All the best,Collins C., Front Office Manager
1	Wonderful, comfortable stay!. My boyfriend and I stayed here for three nights for a long weekend getaway. Everything about this hotel was top of the line. The bed was so comfortable we hated to get up in the morning. The pool area was spotless. We ate one meal, breakfast, at the hotel restaurant. It was delicious but very expensive. My order was wrong and the staff promptly corrected it and did not charge us. There is a Starbucks right in the hotel which is very convenient and an entrance connecting to the Lenox Mall. The staff was very helpful with restaurant suggestions and directions when we needed it. The Buckhead area is beautiful and full of wonderful restaurants. Our favorite was Eclipse Di Luna, an excellent tapas bar/restaurant. I would definitely stay at the JW Marriott again.
0	Never again...beware, if you want sleep.. Currently in bed writing this for the past hr 1/2 there have been dogs barking and squealing call the front desk to advise basically to be told there's nothing they can do. 315.00 and I can't sleep.
0	Great view, comfortable room, grossly understaffed. We arrived quite early so weren't surprised that we couldn't check in. We were told the room was clean but hadn't been inspected yet. We took the shuttle to Pike Place Market for a long lunch then put our 85-year-old mother in an uber to go back to the hotel. It still hadn't been inspected so she had to sit in the lobby till it was ready. We were thrilled with our view of EMP, Space Needle and Chihuly Garden. We had a 1-bedroom suite which is just a regular room with a partial wall to separate the sofa bed from the queen beds. We slept 6 fairly comfortably. Twice when we wanted to shuttle back to the hotel we couldn't get anyone at the front desk to pick up the phone. In the afternoon it took over an hour to finally get a shuttle and since it was a different driver he had a different pick-up place. We almost missed it but happened to look around the corner and half a block up then ran to catch it. After dinner when we again couldn't get through to the desk we called central reservations because they always answer the phone. They tried for 20 minutes to get through to our hotel and couldn't. They finally told us to take a taxi or an uber and we would be reimbursed. Sure enough - standard practice. When we got back to the hotel the only person at the front desk told his sad story of being SO tired and groggy because he had worked a graveyard shift the night before and was the only person at the desk for 2 hours. There was the shuttle driver sitting with nothing to do because if no one answers the phone and finds out where he needs to go he can't actually go anywhere. Very frustrating! On the plus side - breakfast was very good. This place is way overpriced though (over 400 for one night) and not the standard one expects from a Hyatt.Dear JenH,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hyatt house Seattle and thank you very much for the feedback. We will use your comments to improve our hotels operations. I am sorry that your room was not ready by the time you returned for your day out. Also to hear your experience with our front desk and shuttle staff is disheartening. The issues you experience will be addressed. Again I apologize that your stay did not go smoothly as it should have. I hope that you will give us another opportunity the next time you are in town and feel free to contact me directly so I can assist with your next stay personally. Sincerely,Jonathan
0	NOT VERY HAPPY. I am from Bakersfield. I had to Rent A Room For 2 Days Because I had Issues with my Home Some Repairs. What I am told by another Bakersfield Guest And One Of The Staff Members That People From Bakersfield Town Are Put in The Back Of Motel And Never Rent Them The Good Room, Because We Are Only There... More
0	Dirty, stink, no air conditioner!. I could not stay because the room that was given to my family and I was dirty and with a bad smell. The sheets had yellow dirty spots and to add to all this, the air conditioner did not work. The hotel did not want to give my money back, but when I called Hotel.com they took care of everything to me. I've got my refund.
1	A pleasant surprise!. We stayed here end of July 2015. We picked the room here because it was central to some places we were going on vacation. I don't know why this was rated at a 2!! If you want a 5 star hotel then book a five star hotel! Hotel was very clean and updated. Free breakfast was excellent. Pool was nice. Room was great. Only downside was beds weren't the greatest. Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Can't beat the price and get all that anywhere else. Was a small hotel which was fine for us. Made it that much more homey. Would definatly recommend staying here.
0	The Review of Two Rooms. This review is the average of the two rooms my family stayed at on this property. Our first room was terrible. The first thing you notice was the smell of the room. It smelled as bad as a mildew basement. The walls looked as if it was a patchwork of wall paper. Its only redeeming feature was the comfortable bed... More
1	Top Notch Service. We loved this hotel. *location, room, service, it has it all... almost.The location is walking distance to The Financial District, Union Square and Chinatown and a few blocks from the cable car which will take you to the Wharf. The room, we had a suite, was spacious and comfortable. Only drawback was lack of a view (we looked into another building... creepy) We felt like we were in a hole with no windows because we couldn't open our curtains due to feeling like we were constantly being watched.The service was top notch... Oliver felt like a personal friend. He was genuinely helpful and anticipated our needs before we knew we needed him. He suggested wonderful restaurants, parking tips, sightseeing info... the list goes on and on. The front desk was pleasant and the bartender made wonderful drinks.Loved the roof top patio... a little difficult to find but worth the walk up the stairs from the 10th fl.We will definitely stay at the Orchard Garden the next time we visit SF!Thank you so much for the stellar review. Although I am very pleased to read you enjoyed your stay, I apologize the view was less than desirable. Our property was built in 2006 on a vacant lot next to some tall neighboring buildings. I am thrilled Oliver and the front desk team we were able to make your stay more pleasurable. I am extremely fortunate to work with such an enthusiastic team.All of us here look forward to your next San Francisco visit.All the best,Quinn McEnteeFront Office Manager
0	Barely Acceptable. It's pretty obvious the owner is letting this place run down while he collects exorbitant rates (weekends) for a room. My room was clean and very spacious. It also showed signs of lone term neglect. The included breakfast has to be the worst I have encountered - if all you want is a glass of orange juice they can handle... More
1	Very Nice Comfy. My sister and I spent several nights here and we were very happy here. It's very close to the French Quarter - just on the edge of it, I'd say. The room we had was very comfortable - a bit small, but it was pretty, clean, quiet and very nice. The front desk was very helpful and breakfast was great. All in all a great experience and I would recommend this place to anyone. Considering what a good location it is, the rate was surprisingly reasonable which we really appreciated.Thank you guest for taking the time to review our hotel. We appreciate your business and the recommendation. We hope you will come back and stay again soon.
0	The worst experience ever!!!. Do not stay here!!! THIS IS THE WORST! I had a horrible experience. The hotel is smells like fish. Their is a swamp located outside the door that you enter your room. Management does not call you back when you have problems. I had to call the corporate office in order to get a call back from them.The tub got... More
1	nothing special but great just to rest your head!. if your wanting to spend alot of time at your hotal DONOT go here but if you want somewhere cheap, comforty + friendly to rest your head after long days at the parks id recommended it. Have to admit when first arrived i was gutted, but after a couple days realised this was just what we needed. theres a basic breakfast you can help yourself to in morning, free shuttles to all the big parks, i-trolley stop just outside on main road, heated swimming pool, internet + room was quite big apart from bathroom which was small + had a few cracks + dents here + there. Main road behind hotel which thought was going to be a issue coz fairly loud but after spending days in the parks, i can honestly say i had 14 very good night sleeps. would stay there again but as i say it is a budget hotel, just a bed to rest your bed if you are after more form your hotel don't go here.
0	Room w a view of the west Maui sewage treatment plant. First class building that is located directly across the highway from the West Maui Sewage treatment plant. If you room faces east this is you view. Ours was a corner unit that also had views of two abandoned construction sites. The day time winds blew the smell up the hill but at night if the winds drop the smell is... More
0	A pet friendly hotel. For 125, we expected a much better accommodation. The staff was friendly, but the place is showing its age.
0	Mediocore 2 star hotel. Just stayed as had to catch a flight at BWI airport after a long drive. I would rate this a 2 star hotel.
0	Was hoping for more. Booked Galt House based on reviews and was pleased with the great view and excellent location. Unfortunately our suite room was dingy and sorely in need of cleaning and renovation: a broken chair, a clock that didn't work, no coffee pot... On the second day we gave up on having the room cleaned and by 4:00 pm just asked for... More
1	Loved it....Location and Friendly Staff!!!. We stayed here because it was 1 on Tripadvisor and we were not disappointed at all! It was such a great location with extremely friendly staff, we stayed an extra week! The manager, Terry, head of housekeeping, Leonor and our housekeeper, Tina were all very helpful with anything we needed / wanted! They were around on a regular basis to interact w/ guests and offer a friendly hello. It is a smaller hotel w/ only 9 floors, so we found it to be extremely quiet. It is located just 1/2 block from the beach so walking back and forth all day long was no big deal. They offer free towels and beach mats at the front desk as well! Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a GREAT value! We can't wait to get back! MM from CT
1	Ask for a doorstop!!. Everything about this newer hotel was pretty nice. Two big detriments: 14 to park, which is ridiculous for a Hampton Inn. Really!! And the bathroom doors have automatic closers, which is terribly annoying, especially when you have little children with you. When I commented to the front desk clerk on checkout what a hassle this was, she said, Yeah. I know. It's a problem we're trying to work on, but with 182 rooms, it takes a lot to do all of them. I said, Well, you should at least provide a doorstop in the room. Her reply was, Oh, you could have asked for one. We have them here. Well, why on earth isn't there a notice to that effect in the room We could have avoided a lot of misery. Anyway, the staff was very nice. The breakfast was very good. We didn't have an opportunity to use the outdoor/pool area, but it looked very inviting with a nice lounge/conversation area. We'd probably stay here again, but we'd definitely ask for a doorstop if they haven't fixed the doors yet. (And we might try to strike a deal with the restaurant next door to park for less.)Dear Traveler, Thank you for reviewing our hotel. The comments are insightful and helpful for the hotel teams goals to improve the service and guest experience. Please accept our teams sincere apology for the failures in service that resulted in any inconvenience and lack of comfort. We are grateful for the choice you made to be a guest of the hotel. As you know, we are currently working towards a solution that meets both safety standards and guest comfort for the bathroom doors. We will continue striving to provide a hospitality level that exceeds other available lodging choices and hope that you'll give us another opportunity should you return to the San Diego area.
1	Brilliant spot!. Nice clean hotel. Decent room size. Very good location near the magnificent mile and the lake. But the staff makes it stand out. Very very good, friendly, helpful. Shanti was amazing, she helped be negotiate uber to get back to the airport! .Pedro on reception too, above and beyond!Thank you, nicolani74, for taking the time to post a review for the TripAdvisor community. I love being able to pass along great comments to our staff members. The entire team will be so pleased they were able to exceed expectations. I will be sure to pass along your kind words and my thanks as well.We look forward to welcoming you back on your next visit!
0	This is the first hotel room that I have ever stayed in and slept in my clothes!. Don't do it, keep driving....this place is unbelievable! First room they gave me was not made up. The receptionists' explanation was that she had given the keys to another guest who returned them after about 20 minutes. Hmmmmmm.....if that wasn't enough, there was a woman in the next room singing as loud as she possibly could in the room next... More
1	Wasn't as bas as the reviewers described!. After reading the reviews on trip advisor before departing, I headed straight to my travel agent to enquire about a transfer to a different hotel, but was persueded to give it a try. So armed with my bleach wipes and can of oust we arrived at the hotel. However, I need not have worried, as I was not greeted by a musty smell at reception, not rude staff. I entered our room apprehensively, and although it was very dated and basic, it was perfect for our familys needs. Cleanish, with a fridge and tv, room service everyday, and friendly, helpfull staff.The free breakfast was ok for a few days of the holiday, but there are only so many meals you can eat off of a polystyrene plate lol. The best thing about the hotel was it's fantastic location. Situated right behing a KFC, and Walgreens 24hr supermarket and right in the middle of International drive, we couldn't have asked for better. Universal is around a 15 minute walk from the hotel, but it's a lovely walk with beautiful gardens and little lakes on the way there. You are also only 2 minutes away from Wet Wild and a whole load of shops and restaurants.The transport links here are fantastic all the way up down I drive, and the stops are seconds away from the hotel. The free shuttle bus can be very busy, escpecially in the morning and on the 8pm and 10pm return buses from Disney. If you're only off to Aquatica for example, you are better hopping on the I trolley as it only costs 1.25 and your almost always guaranteed a seat.The pool at the hotel is open until 11pm, and its heated, so a welcome relief to your sore feet after a hard day at the parks or shopping.All in all, I would possibly stay here again. It is basic, but from the other reviews I have read, it is no more run down than the more expensive alternatives.
0	Bare minimum.. Pictures must've been old. I got what I paid for....somewhere to lay my head and shower late at night from long drive. Only good thing is they put us where it was quieter. Stairwell and walkways were not renovated and smelled like urine.
0	I Believe Thieves Work There. This was just a terrible experience from check-in to check-out. When you arrive, there is only one person on the property. Get to the room and there is a leak, the microwave does not work and the bathroom is dirty. When they changed our rooms, it was a little better, but no refrigerator (I have four children, no refrigerator is... More
1	My 2nd visit back there it never dissapoints. Stayed back at the felix from 2nd-7th march 2011, thank you so much to Kristina Zakaryan for sorting out my reservation. the staff are so helpful, the doormen even more so. julian was cool, + the other guy (he had an english mum) was so helpful.Once again, my king room was huge, i was given a room that was adjusted for wheelchair users so i guess i had extra space. Great TV, great bed, beautiful lobby, a really nice place to chill in the morning with a free coffee.WIFI is free and very fast, clean, crisp, modern hotel, what more could you ask for...except maybe having a tea/coffee maker in the roomthanks Felix, we'll meet again, dont know where, dont know when......
1	Enjoyed our stay. Everyone was very friendly and our room was nice and clean. My room had yellow sinks and toilet and a phone in the bathroom just like the 70's and 80's Vegas. Would definitelygo back. The only drawback was the breakfast buffet. Although it was given to us free for the first night the food was lousy. Du Pars was a much better choice.Thank you for your review! We appreciate it. If you have any advice on how we can earn that last star, then please let us know, because our goal is to provide you with five-star service.
0	You couldn't pay me to stay there. We made reservations a day prior to arrival, they put us in the room right next to the office. When we arrived, around 8:00 pm, after being on the road all day we expected at least a decent room to crash for the night. The bathtub faucet was leaking and the tub had at least two inches of water in... More
0	Noisy and Indifferant. I was directed to the rear entrance but was unable to use the key card to open the door. This was evidently true for everyone as I heard loud banging on the door until I checked out. Also awakened by loud talking in the hall and barking dogs in the morning. Room was clean and nicely furnished but cheap, only... More
0	The room was not clean and smelled of smoke. We did not.... The room was not clean and smelled of smoke. We did not stay and they would not refund us as we were told that we paid online and could not be refunded.
0	Location Location Location. Great location Close to where I needed to do business. Service so-so and hotel barely accerptable. I needed hotel accomodations for 3 weeks. If the Metro had been acceptable I would have stayed the entire time. Instead I chose to stay at another hotel in GreenBelt (Holiday Inn) one exit away. Just as great a location and much better service and accomodations. Price was about the same.
1	Disneyland Trip. Great room! It was so nice having a kitchen, great money saver!The staff all were all very helpful and friendly. Thank you Susana for cleaning our room perfectly every day! The free breakfast was way better than we expected!We are delighted to have been your chosen hotel during your recent stay in Anaheim. It was truly a pleasure to serve you. We appreciate your business and value your honest feedback. Your comments have been shared with the hotel team as a critical way of understanding how we can continue to deliver exceptional service to guests like you. Thank you for staying at the TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium and we hope you choose to create more memories with us whenever your travels bring you back to Anaheim. Sincerely, Edgar Rivera General Manager TownePlace Suites by Marriott edgar.riveramarriott.com 714-939-9700
0	probably the worst motel in Vegas. To be short: no wifi (it works only at front desk and pool, lol), no refrigerator, very old TV with bad reception, with non working remote. Very small room, actually too small for 2 beds, very old repainted furniture. Stay away !
1	Great places to stay to explore the area. We stayed here for 3 days the last week of March.I was visiting my cousin in Sierra Vista and we had no idea there was so much to do near here.The staff was very cordial and upbeat ,two free drinks a day beer,wine,soft drinks,water.We missed the free dinner Monday-Thursday but the breakfast was a notch above a continental breakfast eggs,sausage,bacon etc.The rooms all have a stove ,full size fridge and microwave.You must visit Kartchner Caverns if you do nothing else.Bisbee is another side trip for a good walk and great food and its quirky shops and bars.Dear Brian F,Thank you very much for taking the time to leave us a review! We are very happy that you enjoyed your stay here with us and that you found plenty fun things to do in the area. We appreciate all of your feedback and we hope you get a chance to visit s again soon. Have a wonderful day! J-Ebare
0	Theft by deception, or just plain stupidity.. Our company books rooms for our techs that travel all across the US. This hotel was paid through Expedia, however still charged the guests personal credit card. When we called the hotel to discuss this error we were met with a stubborn, rude attitude not willing to make the situation right. Shame on you Manager Manu and shame on you Best Western. Last time I checked this is stealing. So beware when staying here and keep a close on on your credit card charges.Dear Wachter R,Thank you for investing your time in reviewing our hotel. Please accept our sincerest apologies regarding the miscommunication you experienced during your stay. In cases when multiple reservations are made through various channels, responsibility lies within the guest. We hope that you would be so kind as to give us another chance and stay with us again, in the future. Once more, thank you for reviewing our hotel.
1	Week-end Napa Trip. We were looking for a Saturday night stay. Most hotels require a 2-night minimum. Inn at the Vines would book a one night for a Queen bed, which was fine with us. AAA discount was 186. If you have a BW member then you get a free breakfast at Denny's which is next door. Hotel was refurbished about 1-year ago, so everything was clean and fresh. Only issue is the in-wall air conditioning units are too loud to run while sleeping.Great location and convenient to freeways.Thank you for your review! I am sorry about the noisey a/c unit and will have it checked out. Almost all units have been replaced and maybe we missed one somehow. Your sleep and comfort is our main goal and with a little fun on the side. Come back and let us show why we are BEST WESTERN!
0	DO NOT STAY HERE. I understand these cabins are 75 years old so I didn't expect to walk into a 5 star facility but I did expect it to be clean, even somewhat clean would have been nice. The shower had not been cleaned AT ALL, the commode was not flushed, one bed had hair in it, the other bed had dirt in it,... More
0	The most disappointing experience at any JW. This had to be one of the poorest experiences I've had at a JW. The front desk staff made little effort to rectify their errors despite me booking this room well in advance. I was put in a handicap room with no attempts to recover the situation. I would take my money and go somewhere else next timeThank you for your recent visit. I want to personally apologize for your disappointment. Please know that I have personally followed up with our front office team as a learning to see how we could have made your experience more positive. We do strive to exceed our guests expectations and to ensure they have a comfortable and enjoyable stay. Thank you for your feedback. I hope you will consider a future visit.
0	Cheap hotel. The staff was not at the desk and when they finally came out ignored me and took another person in front of me. When it was time to check out they couldn't print me a receipt and said they would email me but never did.
0	Efficient Help Needed. My friend and I stayed here last Friday (2 July). First off, we were told the public facilities were unavailable due to work being done in the hall (wallpaper going up). We were assigned our room and it was 1 bed. So went back down and said it was supposed to be 2 beds. We were issued another room (318)... More
0	Garbage Dump in Disguise. Filthiest hotel I've ever stayed at. Room service didn't change the sheets once during a 5 night stay, they only replaced towels. Door didn't close properly allowing loud noises to enter room 24/7. Phone and alarm clock didn't work. Half the lights didn't work. Literal holes in wall, peeling paint. Disgusting.
0	3 Stars should be much better than this... Very disappointed...this is a 3 star It is a 40+ year old hotel they are trying to bring up to date. I commend them for trying to make improvements, but the workmanship was very shoddy and unprofessional. The tile in the bathroom was only 1/2 grouted. The shower faucet was hanging by a screw coming out of the wall. Dried paint was all over the bathroom floor where they painted the walls after laying the tile--without covering it--or cleaning up after. Ceiling texture was all over the light fixtures and mirrors. Lighting in hallways was dark and scary.
0	No heat never go back. I had no heat the carpet was dirty. There were dead bugs everywhere. No iron or ironing board. Smelled of smoke. The arm of the chair had been eating by a dog. Will never go back.
1	Bewst Western Review. It is always the staff experience that provides to customers that's why I like staying at Best Western in Napa. They always do an extra mile and never forget to smile, even the housekeeping they are very polite and always with a smile when they greet you.Armandmariano C - Wow, thank you so much for such a kind review. I agree, the staff experience makes all the difference. Our staff here is stellar and I will make sure to share these kind words with all of them. We look forward to your next visit. Thank you again - Genafer, Director of Sales
1	This relaxed ,old fashioned hotel , in a great location in the French quarter, offers good service and beautiful bedroom. We HD a large room with a balcony at the from of the hotel and loved our stay here. It was a short walk into the heart of the French quarter, yet still quiet.A complimentary breakfast is served every morning which was nice.Our bedroom was very large as was the four poster bed. The there is a little pool in the shady courtyard and this area is a nice place to sit outside with a drink or to have breakfast. Staff efficient and friendly.One small points bathrooms could do with an upgradeThank you so much for your great review! We passed along all of your comments to our management team for review. We appreciate all your feedback! Hope to see you again soon.
1	Very pleasant stay.. During our vacation in San Francisco, we stayed at the Zephyr hotel by Fisherman's Wharf. Hotel location is very convenient for visiting the surrounding areas, and the room was very nice, cosy and nicely appointed. A big thank you goes to the hotel manager, Steven Marais, who helped us out to solve a problem with a very unhelpful and unpleasant guy at a nearby car rental office. We really wish to thank him a lot for his availability and professional attitude.Ciao stefaniach67,Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay at Zephyr!!I am very happy to hear that your stay with us was a great one!! But what I am most happy about is to hear you say how Steven was able to assist you right away making your experience with us one to remember!!At Zephyr, we all hope to see you back whenever you decide to visit our beautiful San Francisco again!!Buon viaggio!Carmen CruzGeneral Manager
0	Lacking in amenities, insect room-mates.. When we got there to check in, they made us pay a 50 deposit per room that they neglected to mention on the phone when the rooms were booked. So instead of renting two rooms as planned, we had to rent just one.The A/C in the room was terrible, it hardly cooled the room down - probably because the insulation was so bad you could see the sunlight around the edges of the room door (which also meant you could hear every person running by and yelling at all hours). The sink in our room also clogged several times.We found several cockroaches crawling in various places (including the bed). We all have random bug bites now, probably from mosquitoes coming in thanks to the poorly sealed door. There were odd stains on the ceiling as well.The free WIFI came in and out, and it interrupts your browsing with full in-browser ads, which actually gave our laptop a virus. It slowed down our computer noticeably during our stay so we checked when we got home and had to remove it.They gave us two tiny bottles of shampoo (no conditioner) and two bars of soap, for a room that's supposed to sleep four people. Three towels, and two hand towels. There was no ice machine, and you have to pay for a mini fridge. They also had no complimentary breakfast in the mornings.All in all, a huge disappointment and we definitely will not be staying at this hotel again. Don't recommend it to anyone else.
1	Excellent value for your money!. We enjoyed our stay at the Best Western Plus Landmark Hotel. The hotel is very close to the places you would want to visit. The breakfast was a good way to start the day. Plenty of food to choose from and great attention by the staff.The Street car and taxi's are just out the door. They are three blocks from Bourbon Street and close the happenings of New Orleans.Dear Anna M, Thank you so much for letting us know about your recent stay with us. We really appreciate the feed back. I hope that you have a wonderful day.Sincerely, Rick Engel - General Manager
1	Great Weekend Stay for Large Group. We stayed here with a large group for our wedding at City Winery and it was nothing but pleasant from the start. Working with the team to set up the room block was made so easy by the incredible staff. Upon our stay, everyone at the hotel went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed and were welcoming and friendly. The hotel has recently renovated the rooms and the lobby/check in area is much more inviting than it was before. Being in NYC, hotel rooms are usually pretty small but I thought these rooms were a good size. I moved into the suite for two nights and that had great views and was big enough for my bridal party and I to get ready in. We hosted brunch on Sunday in the private room at San Marino restaurant next door and it was the perfect send off for our guests. We heard that dinner at San Marino was excellent too, which is also where the room service at Four Points comes from. We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay!
1	Best Southern Hospitality. Upon arrival we meet Veronica, a woman with a beautiful smile, showed professional posture and when beyond the call of duty to make our stay with a feeling of opulence. My husband and I have a certain proclivity towards Wingate by Wyndham rather than other hotels during the Atlanta Jewelry Shows.Dear Mr. Jim M, Thank you so much for taking the time to share your feedback. I will definitely share this information with my entire staff.The Wingate by Wyndham hotel is looking forward for to your next visit to Atlanta please feel free to contact us for any request.Tremeil BooneAssistant Manager
1	Good value for a family vacation. We stayed here for one night with our 2 young kids. As mentioned in other reviews, some of the suites are quite small, although some of that is probably just due to having a divider in the middle of the two parts. It was nice having a divider between us and the kids, even if it was just a clear door. The one suggestion I would make to improve the property would be to have either clouded glass or curtains over the glass part of the doors so that they're not completely transparent. That way you can still watch TV after the kids have gone to bed without worrying about waking them up.While the rooms show some use, the property has been kept up well. The pool was clean and heated and there are some nice areas for eating outside in the perfect San Diego weather. The hotel is about 10 minutes from Sea World, Mission Bay, and downtown,so its a quick jump to everywhere, although the downside is that nowhere is within walking distance. The best part of the hotel was the staff. They were very accommodating when we requested a crib for the room and, after we left one of our phone chargers, they went to our room and called us when they had found it. Service like that is what makes this hotel go from just average to very good.Overall, this hotel is a solid choice, as long as you don't mind driving to the local attractions. Also, just as a tip, there's a parking fee for parking in the lot, however, you can park on the steet for free, as long as you can find a spot.Thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey regarding your recent stay at our hotel.Your feedback is very important to us and we can assure you that we will use this information to do everything possible to create an enjoyable experience for each of our guests. We hope to see you again soon!Sincerely,Art CollantesGeneral ManagerComfort Suites Mission Valley(619)-881-4000
0	Slow speed Internet also need refurbishing. The internet was so slow that my data kicked in. That I could be OK with just a nuisance. I got back to my room around 9pm and wanted to take a bath. The stopper on the tub did not work so could not do that. I think it is funny how things that are so minor do not work... More
0	smelly room. we booked this hotel via hotwire, the only thing good about this hotel was the location, it was very close to the disney world area, the quality of the hotel was poor, parking lot dirty, room smelled HORRIBLE, the ac stopped working in the middle of the night, the breakfast was crappy. If you get it in a little late at night, there is no parking available with some lighting only spots out back in the dark. would NEVER go back.
1	Cheap, great breakfast, easy access to metro. After doing research for hotels in D.C areas, I found this hotel very attractive in term of price and easy access to metro to D.C. They provide shuttle to the closest metro station, and the metro go directly to D.C downtown which is very helpful for us. However, I recommend to use their shuttle not during the peak hours, especially from 5 to 7pm, otherwise you end up joining a bunch of people waiting for shuttle. The breakfast is surprisingly very good, especially the waffle which is one of the best. My kids and I love it, and I recommend this hotel for family trip.
0	hated it. There are only 2 good things to say about this hotel. It has a great location and is better than sleeping on the street. That's it.
0	A homeless shelter is better than this place. Everybody seems to have a story about this one motel they stayed in this one time when out of town on business this one time. WELL I HAVE MINE and i am going to share it with you. My company booked me for a week here thru orbitz. Apparently the confirmation didn't go thru or they over booked and blamed... More
0	Not as expected. We reserved a room with 2 queen beds. We were given room 1 (The Mayberry room) and were really excited based in the other reviews for the motel. The room does not have 2 queen beds it has 2 double beds. Room was small, bathroom was small. Shower only, no tub. No light in the closet, 3 plastic hangers. Window... More
1	Great location-Enjoyable stay. My husband and I booked a room here over the past Thanksgiving for two nights when we flew in from North Idaho to celebrate the holiday with our son and his family. The room was comfortable and had nice amenities. Ruth Chris Steak House is attached to the hotel which serves fabulous meals. Expensive but very good quality. As with most Seattle hotels parking is very expensive-around 45 a day and even 30 to self park so our son picked us up when we arrived and then we took a town car when we had to return to the airport. 65 included tax and gratuity and was arranged by the hotel concierge, Molly, who was most helpful. She also told us about the train to the airport but when she said you have a half mile walk from the station to the airline counters we declined. Only around 3.00 so if the weather is good (ours wasn't) and you don't have a lot of packages (we did) it would be the way to go. You can catch the train only two blocks from the hotel. The hotel is in a perfect location for shopping, eating or theater going in Seattle. Very close and easy walking distance to major stores and lots of wonderful small ones. Also located next to the convention center so very convenient for that too. We were disappointed to come back from shopping at almost 2:00 and find our room had not been cleaned as yet. We also did not care for the heating system. It has a vent at the top of the wall and when it came on it blasted your head with cold air when you were in bed. Don't understand why it was cold as we had it on heat. These were the only two negatives and we would definitely stay again. Our room was very quiet except for when the idiots in the corner room next to us let their door slam about 12 times around midnight. I was just about to call the front desk when it stopped. They had a nice business center and allowed you to web check in for your flight for free but charge to use the internet.
0	Great location.. Rooms are very dated but they are beachfront with easy access to the beach. The Crab Trap Restaurant is very close and many other choices close by. Located on Scenic Hwy 98 this motel is in a great location.
1	Champagne welcome. Checking in on New Year's Eve and there was an abundance of staff and champagne cocktails to speed our check in and get our celebration started right away. We had a wonderful room with a private butler and an amazing view of the fireworks over the San Francisco skyline.Dear Guest,Thank you for sharing your review of your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco. I am delighted to hear that you had an exceptional stay over the holiday and that you particularly enjoyed the celebratory cocktails upon arrival. Please do not hesitate to contact me directly prior to your next visit to the hotel. Happy New Year!Sincerely,William FongHotel Manager415-284-4057William.fongstregis.com
1	Bang for your buck. The hotel offered great service from check-in to check-out. Room was impeccably clean. Great room at a great price! Close to airport and not far from amusement parks. Will stay here again and highly recommend to others!!!Dear Guest Maria P J, I would like to thank you on behalf of my team at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport for your kind comments on our performance and your experience on your stay. Every single employee of this hotel prides themselves in the quality of their work striving for 101 to exceed our family guest's expectations every day.I want to thank you for your loyalty and support. We are looking forward to welcome you, family and friends to once again provide you with an outstanding level of service and nothing less. Sincerely,Alex BlancoGeneral Manager
1	Awesome Stay. My sister came into town so we decided to go to The National Harbor for a night. Checking in, the hotel staff was very pleasant. Parking is in a garage behind the hotel, for 18. Our room was clean with nice views. The bed was very comfortable. We were able to walk comfortably to the harbor and sightsee. There are also restaurants and bars within walking distance. Breakfast was great, with canadian bacon and sausage patty meat options. There was also a waffle station, eggs, potatoes, fruit, yogurt, cereal, muffins, and other pastries. Checkout was a breeze, and the front desk staff again, was very pleasant. I very much enjoyed my stay and I will definitely return!
0	OMG! 70.00 for this!!!. Passing through Tn. And had to stop somewhere for the night. It was part of the choice hotel deal so we thought maybe the rooms are nicer on the inside than the outside since they spent a small fortune on advertising billboards. The room was absolutely depressing. Desperate need of updating. Walls were cracked and dirty. The bathroom had fixtures... More
1	Staff is great, rooms and lounge could use a facelift. Marriott Platinum. The people at the JW Marriott Buckhead are great. From the front desk, room service delivery, lounge staff, to the other people we interacted with the customer service is great. The rooms and lounge however feel dated. The rooms are clean and spacious but it reminded me of the late 90s/early 2000s. The lounge is also smaller than expected and the food options are OK but they run out quick! Overall, the stay was above average with the staff being the stars. I would stay here again, but would like to see a facelift.Thank you for taking the time to let us know about your visit. I am glad you found our staff accommodating and they provided you with great customer service. I wanted to share that within the past week we have replaced our lobby and Nox Creek Lounge carpet and next summer, our Grand Ballroom will be re-invented. I am glad you will be visiting again.
0	Price was the only thing good. My daughter and I stayed here August 2015. The price was good but you get what you pay for. The desk clerk's young boys were in the lobby when we checked in. She was apologetic because they were rather unruly. Why her husband couldn't take them to the store with him, I don't know. He probably didn't want to be... More
0	Way to pricey. Lobby is clean and fresh smelling as is elevator. Room was mostly clean, but not clean smelling. Breakfast offered is coffee, fruits or a quarter piece of muffin and you have to eat it in the tiny closet sized room that has a tv few tables, not allowed to take the food to your room. The price for mid... More
1	Good airport hotel. 5 minutes from airport this hotel is good for overnighting while flying or for Orlando business meetings close to airport. Had a small suite so we could conduct meetings then crash for the night. SWeveral good restaurants within walking distance and shuttle to and from airport saved me car rental cost.Adjustable bed support was interesting but hot....foam retained heat.Dear hjb4971,I want to personally thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule to share your experience with your recent stay. We at Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport believe that great service + good accommodation Satisfied guest and is our daily goal to make sure we exceed your expectations.Thank you very much for staying with us and please ask for me next time so I can personally welcome you to your home away from home.Sincerely,Alex Blanco
1	Wonderful Hotel and Perfect Holiday Stay!. Our holiday stay at the NOPSI was PERFECT! The hotel and the architecture are spectacular. The staff, from housekeeping to management, was professional, efficient, polite and friendly. The service was just as one would expect from a luxury hotel. I can't say enough about the bartenders at all 3 bars. They were knowledgeable mixologists, friendly and efficient. The view from the rooftop bar is grand and so is the atmosphere. The lobby bar is beautiful and the live music in the evenings was a wonderful treat. Room service was delivered quicker than anticipated and was delicious! Our breakfasts were first class! The 3 egg omelet Pontchartrain, Porchetta Hash and Eggs, Pecan Belgian Waffles and 1/2 Ruby Grapefruit Brle were the best room service meals I believe my husband and I have ever had for breakfast. The room service wait staff was polite and friendly. Although we did not dine at Public Service during this stay, we have in the past and found the food and service to be exemplary. Christmas morning we were greeted with a stocking hanging on our door. The stocking was filled with fresh fruit, candy and baked goods. What a wonderful surprise! The accommodations were beautiful and comfortable. My husband is generally very uncomfortable sleeping in hotel beds and lounging on hotel furniture, but he was very comfortable during our stay at the NOPSI. He was so pleased, that he has already booked the hotel for a return business trip in the near future. Love this beautiful hotel in my favorite city! Can't wait to return.Sharon, Thank you for sharing your wonderful review on TripAdvisor. I am thrilled that you enjoyed a little lagniappe on Christmas morning as well as phenomenal service throughout your stay. It is an honor to be your hotel of choice in New Orleans. Our team looks forward to welcoming you again on your next visit. Warm regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager

1	Well Located. Nice hotel. Chinatown 10metres away. rooms clean and tidy. comfortable. Reception really obliging and polite an friendly. Only concern was a sign that was in an obscure place stating it was a health hazard staying at this hotel and that it could cause cancer. upon asking receptionist what this was about - she didnt know!! We found this on checking out - so a little advice to the Orchard Garden Hotel - if there is not health hazard - remove that bloody sign - if there is - then we should know about it BEFORE we book so we can make an informed decision.Thank you so much for sharing your experience with the Orchard Garden Hotel. Although I am delighted to read the property was to your liking, I am so very sorry regarding the confusion behind the warning sign. I will make sure everyone at the front desk knows where the pamphlets are explaining the details.In 1986 California voters approved an initiative (proposition 65) to address their growing concerns about exposure to toxic chemicals. The Office of Environmental Hazard Assessment requires all businesses to notify patrons of such toxins. They have put together a list that contains a wide range of naturally occurring and synthetic chemicals that can harm people. Some of the chemicals listed are additives or ingredients in pesticides, common household products, food, drugs, dyes or solvents. Listed chemicals may be used in manufacturing and construction, or they may be byproducts of chemical processes, such as motor vehicle exhaust.As a LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certified hotel we really dont use many chemicals at all, but we still have the sign to be compliant. We pride ourselves as a smoke free hotel. Our housekeepers use green seal certified cleaning products, which are just as effective as harsh traditional cleaners. Rooms and halls are fitted with 2 recycled carpeting that sets off a low V.O.C (volatile organic compound) and 100 recycled padding under the carpet. All fabrics are made with recycled polyester and other textiles without chemicals and are machine-washed to avoid the chemicals that come with dry cleaning. Although the food provided in the restaurant is organic from local farms, needless to say the liquor served at the bar can be harmful to someone pregnant. I hope you find comfort in this brief explanation. If you like I would be more than happy to send you more information regarding OEHHA and Proposition 65. All of us here would be elated to have you stay with us again hopefully you can choose us without hesitation.Kind regards,Quinn McEnteeFront Office Manager
0	Noisy hotel - small rooms. This hotel placed in the middle of Chicago has its inconveniences. Directly placed next to overground trains you see and hear them - all time. Walking me up every night at 4 am , no need for a wake up call.Paper thin walls (I can hear my neighbors conversations do not add to the comfort. I think this Is also the smallest hotel room I have ever been in in the US. The closet is not even wide even to hang your shirts.It is clean an proper looking but there are things you cannot make up for.Thank you so much for taking the time to provide feedback on your stay. I'm sorry to see that you had a negative experience at our hotel! Should you stay with us again, we could place you on a high floor away from street noise and the train. We have larger rooms, as well, such as our King Premier that would provide you with the extra space you're looking for. We would love the opportunity to offer you a much improved stay in the future!
0	We're not staying here next year. Low point in our AWESOME vacation.. Location, location, location. This is the main reason this hotel stays in business. We had the best vacation in our 8 days in Orlando, and the hotel room was the only thing that did not work out for us. The price was low, and we got what we paid for.We were recommended this hotel by a travel agent based in Orlando, who told us that the Days Inn we were looking at was disgusting. We did not expect the Ritz, but the photos on the hotel website are at least 15 years old and taken from the best possible angles. It is in a great location, it took us 21 minutes to walk to Universal, and it is a beautiful walk with wide sidewalks the whole way.At check in we were assigned room 207. When we entered, the carpets had wet spots, and smelled like urine. The front desk immediately gave us a key for a room on the third floor. This room did not smell, and we did stay in it. It was not clean enough for our standards, so we purchased cleaner and paper towels and spent an hour cleaning the bathroom and vanity ourselves. Toilet ran- had to giggle the handle every time to stop water flow. Shower was moldy, pipes were loud, and pressure/temperature would vary greatly during your shower.The bed sheets are too small for the bed, and completely threadbare. At least they seemed clean. The bath towels were rough and the size of large hand towels. We had 5 people in the room, but most days got only 3 towels and had to ask for more at the front desk. Rugs were nasty- we kept on our shoes in the room. Only one door key was assigned, and the plastic key would get stuck in the lock every time.On the positive side, the kids loved the pool, and it was cleaned daily. The pool area is a bit old, and the chairs are cheap, but the pool bar is adequate and serves decent food. You can use your laptop near the pool. Pool towels are available at the front desk if you ask for them- but they do not let anyone know this, and most of the other families were using their bath towels.Breakfast was spartan, none of the fruit or muffins they show on the website. Bread for toast, milk, OJ, and frosted flakes were the only options for the kids. Coffee was TERRIBLE. There is an IHOP within a block and about 20 breakfast buffets within 1 mile- use them if you want a good breakfast.From this location you can walk to so many restaurants, and can catch a bus to anywhere in Orlando. Try eating O'Charleys on Turkey Lake Road (1 mile away). They had great food and prices. Lots of great spots for ice cream nearby.Our family is planning to return to Orlando in 2011 and have found much, much nicer properties for only a slightly higher cost. Look at the trip advisor ratings and try to find a higher rated hotel. It's worth the extra cost, especially with the low rates that hotels charge in Orlando.Good luck, and enjoy your time in this spectacular city!
0	Avoid if at all possible. I have never written a bad hotel review before - and I have not recently had such a bad stay.I travel frequently for business and family events. Comfort Suites was the worst hotel I have stayed at in years. The hotel appears tired but our room was really bad - the carpet was lumping up from the base floor, there... More
1	Good hotel but not a good value for the money. Good location, friendly staff, good breakfast. Room was clean and comfortable. Parking is atrocious. Be prepared to either double (or triple) park in their tiny lot, or park on the street. My real complaint is that, while I fully understand high season and high demand can drive up rates, this was not a 250 per night hotel. In any other circumstance this would be 100 less per night for a comparable hotel at another time/place. Thank you for your review on tripadvisor. It is from reviews from our guests that allow us to find areas that may need improvement. We are happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us on your recent trip. Our staff takes great pride in providing friendly service to our guests.The parking garage does present some challenges because of it's small size. Summer is a high drive time so this is when we have problems. We do double park cars to try to satisfy as many guests as possible as alternative parking is a few blocks away. As too our rates we are very well placed with hotels that are similar to ours.We hope that you would consider us again on your next trip to New Orleans.Robert K., Manager on Duty
1	Good centrally located hotel with old time charm.. The Whitney is about five blocks or so from Canal and on to the bars and restaurants of the French Quarter. At night it is a quiet walk past hotels and office buildings once you cross canal returning home. The staff is very friendly in that way New Orleans is. There is a small restaurant for breakfast and coffee if it is raining outside. Rooms are nice and quiet. Would definitely stay again.Thank you for this wonderful review of the Whitney Hotel. We're so happy to hear you enjoyed your visit. If we can be of any other assistance in the future, please don't hesitate to contact us. We look forward to seeing you again soon!Sincerely, Casey A.

0	AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES. This morning I called to inquire about the availability for a five night stay wanting to give this property another chance from a previous unpleasant experience. A couple of months ago, I called to inquire about a stay and had experienced poor customer service. At that time, I wrote it off as perhaps the representative was having a bad day.... More

0	Expected more service.. This hotel was very nice with a great location. (providing what you want to do) I love NOLA so even as a solo visitor for one night I booked with SPG as I always do as a platinum member. Upon arrival I was upgraded (sunday night helps with that always) and the room was nice and shower was just fine.I ran into problem with a very slow internet connection and after making every attempt to fix it on my end... after speaking to a colleague I realized it was simply the internet was bad. This made it very difficult and had to walk and send some documents from a coffee shop. All easy fixes in all honesty.Where i was very disappointed was with the cleanliness of my bed. After waking up and checking that all window were shut as it felt if someone was smoking in my face I realized my pillow had not been washed or were just that old that they reeked of smoke and it actually gave me a bit of a soar throat. When i told the staff, i was met with a simple. Sorry, while I appreciate that at 6am I was expecting something a little more above and beyond. So I went on a walk because I couldn't sleep any longer. Very disappointed.
0	AWFUL. It was overbearingly awful. The humidity and the foul mold odor was over our heads. Thank God we only stayed one night, but seriously this hotel either needs a demolition or remodeling.
1	Gorgeous! with a little hicupp. We arrived by chance at the St.Regis after the Waldorf failed to provide us with an updated room. The St. Regis was very beautifully appointed and the front desk staff was very accommodating as well. We needed a larger room as we were having guests joins us for dessert and drinks and although there was an additional charge 1,000 more for the room, it was just what we needed and really pretty. The room however, was with out a view, or rather with a view of other building walls, so in the morning it was a bit dreary and dark. If you book a room at the St. Regis, make sure to ask for a high floor or you will be in darkness, despite the wonderful dcor and amenities.Dear Dirwpgops, Thank you for taking the time to detail your recent stay with us. We are pleased to hear that you enjoyed your larger room but are dissapointed that you were not pleased with the view. Should you ever encounter this again, kindly contact our Front Desk team to see if we have alternative options for you. Thank you again and we hope to see you again soon.With warm regards,Pedro RodriguezDirector of Front Office
1	Great value. I stayed for 2 nights here where the rooms and service met up with other Marriott properties I have stayed in the past. Like the other reviews here, the only issue here was hearing the train whistle. As I grew up close to a train crossing, hearing it didn't bother me but I could see how someone not used to it could be really shaken by the experience.Other than that, they offer a value-filled room with kitchenette, a well-equipped one at that. Similar to Residence Inn properties, there's a fridge, dishwasher, sink, and stove along with some basic cookware and utensils. This property even had a food disposal unit.As much as there was a bed, living area, bathroom, kitchenette, and work desk, there really wasn't much place to sit down and eat for more than one person. I suppose a group of people could eat in the living area but I wouldn't find it all that comfortable.The services available in the lobby were fantastic, there a computer with free internet AND free printing (although there's a 30-minute time limit to be fair to other guests). There's also complimentary coffee available all day and even a map of the general area where the attractions, shopping, and restaurants are listed.
0	management stole my money. my son and I was charged 100, which overdrafts my account, for smoking in a non smoking room....I quit smoking 5 years ago and my son is 6...there was no one smoking on my room. when I found out I went back and was told oh well by management. I am a single parent and moving back to Texas next week because my mother was diagnosed with cancer. now I may not get to go...so what do I think about this motel....I don't have the words to express my Ander and hurt at what they have done...Sorry to hear about the fee. However, when we find hard evidence of smoking in our non-smoking designated rooms we charge a 100.00 clean up fee.
0	Disappointed. I was quite disappointed with this hotel. The front desk clerk was rude and put my family in a dirty room (beds were not made, one of the pictures was pulled off of the wall and food still in the room). I then had to switch rooms and clerk seemed annoyed that I was unhappy with the status of my room.
1	Arizona Experience. Front desk clerks and housekeeping staff were friendly and professional. Room was clean and beds slept well. Location is quiet as well as convenient. Local strip malls within walking distance - restaurants, grocery store, fast food, gas station all within walking distance. Metro bus stops nearby as well. Quick trip from and to the airport, to Scottsdale, and downtown Phoenix. Offers coffee all day however I would have loved to have had a continental breakfast. Dear Lee P,Thank you so much for staying with us. I am happy to hear that you found your room to be exactly what you need. We don't serve breakfast, but we are located close to many places to grab a bite to eat. I do hope that the next time you are in Phoenix, you will stay with us again.Sincerely,Dallas A.Assistant General Manager
1	Super Premium Experince. If you want to experience the perfect city hotel in New York with everything from service, location and friendliness this is perfect.We spend Christmas here and it was amazing. The room was very nice, quiet and with a fantastic bed and everything. The service at the reception was very good and also during the rest of the stay.The butler service was also very good. We will definitely come back. The only thing that can be improved are the lights at breakfast, it was to bright so you missed a little bit of the coziness.Dear Andrew18985,Thank you for taking the time to review your stay at The St. Regis New York. We are thrilled to hear that you enjoyed your time with us, and hope that you will return to NYC soon. We thank you for your comments regarding the lights at breakfast. We greatly appreciate your feedback and will share your comments with our team.Best Regards,Manuel MartinezHotel Manager
1	Excellent location service could be better. We stayed in two rooms for one week. The hotel IS IN the convention center. Had I know this, I would have booked at a smaller place. As a result, it was very crowded and there was no real personal attention. The rooms were clean and offered lovely views. Club level was worth it. Sadly, my young son lost his treasured baby blanket at the hotel. (we think in the laundry). And there were many many tears over that. I think more from me! We asked several times with several people, but it was never found. We are still heart broken.
1	Great Hotel!. This is the best hotel Ive stayed in in a while The hotel had friendly staff, a great location, free happy hour, the room was nice looking (modern), clean and comfortable. We also lounged by the pool during the day which was quiet and mellow (not a loud party scene) and was perfect. We also ended up having an incredible view of fireworks from the stadium! Most places we ate out at were a 5 minute walk which is also nice. Next time Im in town, I will stay here again. I was in room 520. Best hotel! Love it, Jenin. Thanks so much for the great review. We hope to see you back soon!
0	Old, dirty, not too pricy. Just stayed here Feb '12. Not a horrible place for the . I paid 85 for the room and it's right in downtown atlanta next to the marriot. Usually the location at lone would command 100 minimum per night. Parking was confusing. i don't like to pay for valet so I opted to park my car alone when I pulled up, and about 100ft down the street from the main entrance is a parking garage in the same bldg, so I parked there (15 a day). Upon walking to the desk to check in I was informed their parking garage is cheaper, but it's located caddy corner across the st to the hotel (weird). The desk clerk tried to convince me to go get my car from where it was parked and pull it into their garage - again, weird. I was put on the 9th floor (elevator is pretty shoddy - as soon as it stops at a floor the doors immediately open and shut to keep going, be careful). The room wasn't too bad. Decent size. Old tv, pretty visually unappealing. Bathroom was full of hairs, everywhere. Also there was a bucket under the sink to deal with a leaking pipe. I'm usually low maintenance and don't mind the occasional spot or hair, but this room just felt really dirty and gross. The bed was the worst part. Although it was a king, it was horribly uncomfortable. Worst back pain of my life in the morning. Fitness center is a joke. Although spacious, it has a treadmill and a bike, and a multi gym weight tower in the middle, that is in awful condition and all of the cables are broken. I didn't even bother working out there. Breakfast was modest. Literally ice cold pastries, watered down juices, do it yourself waffles, and reconstituted eggs. Breakfast starts at 6 and I got there at 6:30, and a kid that apparently worked there (no id/uniform) was scrambling to set everything up - I'm guessing he was late for work. Other people he was hanging out with and eating with (other employees or his friends) were also there chatting and having a good time. Very strange, I don't think they were guests, and I think it is inappropriate for the employees to be eating breakfast with guests.Again, for the price I'm really not complaining, you get what you pay for. Location isn't too bad either. Had I paid more of this was a more prestigious brand hotel, I'd be writing a letter to the CEO.shaunbsc,Thank you for your review. Since your stay, we have been actively working to improve our service level, responsiveness, and the functionality of our products to ensure things are operating as they should. We have been updating and upgrading our rooms and the general appearance of our property. I hope you have safe travels in the future. Best Regards,Enoch D.
0	Very basic. We were travelling up west coast and arrived in s.f. when the nike ladies marathon was on, which we did not realise. Made it impossible to get a hotel room. Eventually we arrived at Columbus Inn which had a free room for the night.Hotel was cheaper than others we had tried on the shore but very basic. Think we paid approx 170 for the night and do not think that this really represented value for money, although there was free parking which was good as it always annoys me when US hotels have an additonal charge to use their car park.Room was ok - had the feel that the cleanliness of the hotel was not great but did not actually have any issues. This was maybe more due to the impression the hotel gives by fact that it is quite run down. Hotel is in dire need of a coat of paint!!!Was glad that we were able to get a room here as nowhere else was available but that probably says something in itself. Probably ok if all you need for a night is a bed but thought that this hotel was very overpriced even for that.Will not be staying here again.
1	Nice for short stay. Our family of 4 stayed one night on our way home to Houston from Orlando. Our room was clean, comfortable and very quiet. The room has fridge, microwave, safe deposit box. Rate is reasonable with free parking, a short walk from the hotel. The street car is right in front of the hotel for a 30 minutes ride to french quarter for 1.25 per person. At around 6:30pm, we only had to wait 5 minutes for another car but around 10:00pm, the wait was exactly 30 minutes. Four family of 4, we did not find any cost or time saving buy taking the street car. We just did it for the experience.
0	Changing Names But Still Poor Quality Ivy Hotel to Indigo Hotel. I made the mistake of not checking reviews, this hotel is Nasty... Dirty bathroom sink, dirty floors, and common hallways trash and laundry is left out by hotel room doorways for hours, even overnight. I also carry Clorox wipes, and need every one. AC did not work,called no one ever came to checked the AC sent a written list to manager. NO RESPONSE! Manager must think if they change their name, the bad reviews will stop and they can get away with disappointing more people who visit this lovely region. No hangers in closet, closet door was pulled off hinges, and we stayed in what was billed as the King Suite ( most expensive room rate) thinking we have a lovey spaces to relax in at the end of our day. Wrong! Noisy things banging and outside the windows was mechanical area. Go anywhere but here!
0	Excellent place to stay if you go to SDSU. Nice place to stay. It is at walking distance to SDSU, about 20 minutes, where you can take the trolley to downtown San Diego.The personal is very kind. The rooms are big and the place is quiet. Nearby you can find restaurants and shops.

Staff was very nice. Continental breakfast is just that,but they do have waffle grill. Its the... More

0	Convenient ........but!. Convenient location for Midtown. However, 2 of 3 elevators were out of service, no towels were left in room after 1st night maid service, vents in bath exhaust were filthy, AC made load noises, and shower hot/cold adjustment would not work. Maybe try somewhere else.
1	Hyatt at The Bellevue. A great place to stay. A good location in the centre of Philadelphia with friendly staff who make you feel very welcome. Good facilities such as the sports centre and bar XIX on the top floor. Comfy bed.Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt at The Bellevue. We're glad to hear that you enjoyed our top floor XIX (NINETEEN) Restaurant and room accommodations. Our hotel is located in the best spot in Philadelphia just minutes away from all the attractions, and next to the Broad Street Subway Line which is a quick ride to all the Stadiums/Universities.We hope to welcome you back to Philadelphia soon and please follow us on Twitter bellevuephillyKind regards,CR
0	Not so great.... My husband and I visited Atlanta, and just finished our 5 night stay at this hotel. They overbooked, so our double was upgraded to a king suite. Score!The location was good, right off 75. There was a mall, Walgreen's and several restaurants nearby. And you can't beat free parking, wireless and breakfast - and a microwave and small fridge in the room!Unfortunately, I have to give them a lower rating for the room itself. We were a little lost at first because our room did not have a number posted. After a little walking up and down the hall at 10:30PM, we figured it out. The room had a funky smell. Not really bad, just smelled weird. It was much more humid in our room than the rest of the hotel. I think the room air conditioning unit was not working properly. Cable did not work, so we could not watch TV (Not really a bad thing, who wants to watch TV on vacation anyway So we never called to have it fixed). The bathtub faucet dripped constantly. There was lots of trash under and around the bed - paper towels shoved between under the headboard, between the wall and mattress, bits of paper and wrappers, a wooden coffee stir stick. The entire time there it was never cleaned out. Some liquid had been splashed on the headboard and dried. That was also never cleaned off. The cherry on top was I went to use one of the new wash cloths replaced by housekeeping, and found a hair stuck in it that clearly did not belong to me or my husband.FYI elevators can be a little scary - very slow to open! We never got stuck, but there were a few times I was not so sure...It was OK for the price we paid, but I wouldn't stay there again. Next time we will try another hotel in the area.
1	Great hotel in the Buckhead area. I have stayed at this hotel on several different business trips over the past ten years, most recently in April 2013, and have consistently had a good experience. I will continue to stay here on trips to the Buckhead area. The hotel is clean and well-maintained. Staff is friendly and very helpful - delivering boxes to my room, sending a fax for me at no charge, and even driving me to a nearby office building that was just a tad far for walking. The hotel is attached via walkway to the Lenox Mall.This may be a strange thing to rave about, but I ordered oatmeal from room service for breakfast, and it was BY FAR the best dang oatmeal I have ever had. Ever. Sweet, creamy, delicious. The only negative is - I had intended to have a healthy breakfast, and I am sure that oatmeal was far, far from healthy. But so good.
0	Great Location - Great Staff - Terrible Condition. My husband and I usually stay 3 or more times a year at this hotel when we go in to Midtown to see a play at the Woodruff Arts Center Complex. The location is excellent - within easy walking distance to do this and also a couple of acceptable restaurants nearby.We went last week and on a Tuesday night, I made the reservation 2 hours prior using my Marriott Rewards Elite Member points. When we arrived we were told they were starting a refurbishment of the hotel so the water was off until about 6:30. Why not mention this when I was making the reservationSo no nice hot shower and chance to spruce up and change clothes before going out to make the theater curtain. So we decided o.k. we will go to plan B - no play we will go out to eat and then just watch a movie in the room - with no kids around- what a treat - something without talking animals! But wait - the movie channels were not working on the TV- so no movie or play! To be fair the front desk offered to send someone to try and fix the problem - but we were already in our pajamas and I just did not feel like getting redressed for a stranger to come attempt to fix the issue. We just went to sleep. The condition of our queen suite should have been embarrassing to the Marriott corporation. The easy chair in the room looked worse than a thrift store find - it would have been better to take it out of the room than leave something in that condition in the room. The ceiling/walls in the bathroom had been recently spackled/repaired which is fine - except the cleaning staff did not clean up the dust from this repair.The staff were all wonderful. The young lady at the front desk was polite and tried her best to be helpful. The women at the breakfast buffet in the morning was so friendly and went and got me a bottle of water from downstairs when I ask if there was water available (a glass of tap water would have been fine). The breakfast has good selections for a free hotel breakfast.Valet parking has gone up to 28 - ouch!I am very disappointed that because of the remodeling and the other maintenance glitches our child free romantic night on the town turned in to a less than stellar evening. What a waste of my rewards points.
1	Concierge George is an amazing asset to The Ritz-Carlton Central Park. I am currently on my last day of a five night stay at The Plaza, where my stay has been disappointing. Tonight, I joined colleagues for a quick drink in the Star Lounge at The Ritz-Carlton Central Park and wow, what a difference. The room is intimate, warm, elegant and the servers attentive. However, what really impressed me and drove me to write this review, is George at the concierge desk. I only had a simple question - the location of the ladies room - and George was all smiles, warm and friendly. He is an outstanding asset to the hotel. I will rave about this hotel and recommend it to others simply because of George. What a great first and last impression!
0	Not your typical Hampton. The outside looks great, the inside not so much. Dirty stained carpet in the hallway. Dirty floor in the elevator. Bathroom not clean, long black hairs on the floor. Chairs in the dining area stained.
1	Phily Stay. Awesome hotel in an awesome location in an awesome city. The staff went above and beyond. The style of the hotel was great. We had an awesome view of city hall. Perfect central location to do anything in Phily.Perryjo9,Thank you so much! Awesome is certainly the word I would also choose to describe our team, they are the best in the city, and we are truly fortunate to have them all. I am so glad to hear that you enjoyed yourself so much, and I hope that we have the chance to see you again soon!Andrew DrydenAssistant General Manager
0	Bed bugs. What else is there to say Two word review: bed bugs. No one or two bed bugs...I came out with 30+ bites. It is easy to call this a nightmarish experience. If you value your sanity, please, I implore you, pay the extra money and don't even consider this place for one second.
0	Atrocious. While the room itself was clean enough, with newly renovated bathrooms, it stank of Lysol, and since I would not advise leaving the windows open, given the homeless people and drug addicts who wander around the open halls here, the rooms can be quite stuffy. But the problem is less the room, but rather the kinds of people that management allow to stay in the rooms. We stayed next door to Room 29 which is blatantly a brothel with people coming and going all night, and I even got solicited one night for some fun by a prostitute in the parking lot. Random people knocking on our door at 5am, smashing bottles outside the door, people arguing and fighting in the middle of the night. Rows of homeless people sleeping around the sides of the building. While they do have a security guard who wanders around, he does not do very much. The area is not dangerous per se, as we would come back for nights out on the town late at night and no one bothers you walking the streets as long as you mind your business. I could go on, but do yourself a favor, and dig into you pocket, pay a few dollars more, and stay away from this place. That way, you can actually enjoy your stay in SF.
1	Review. Great location a block off canal and just outside French quarter, very nice rooms, spacious, not much privacy in bathroom space and somewhat see through shower glass pane into main room. Would be more ideal for couples then friends/family. Overall great atmosphere. Very happy, would book again.Thank you for taking the time to share your review of our hotel. We do have a bit of flare in the most of the bathrooms as you alluded but we certainly have rooms with a bit more modesty available, please be sure to note and request that when you book next time!See you soon,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations
0	The sleaziest most disgusting hotel ever!. Think of the meth hotel in Breaking Bad and you might be able to visualize the filthiness, the rundown, the broken items in this room. There is.mold in the bathroom, black hair in the shower, I can't say one good thing about it. Never never book a reservation here unless it't for someone you hate and even then it might be too much.
0	Nice, but never again.... We stayed at the hotel for a week and the price was too high for whatwe received. The problem that makes me feel like not staying there again is that the room was full of ants. We founded it out because theyattached all our laundry bag, in the closet. Full of cloth waiting tobe picked up. They where very small black sticky ants, those you cannottake away with nothing. I felt horrible about this. It was discusting! I felt really ashamed and didnt whant anyone to see that repugnant scene. And the room, even though it had a beautifull bathtub in the middle of the room, separatyng sleeping area from bathing area, it was really small for the price payed. Decoration was excellent. Nice colors, very relaxing. Nice vanity staff. But the ants thing , made me feel very bad!! puaj!! Never again! I cannot forget the hundred ants all over my cloth! puajj!
1	Great place. Great location. Great staff.. Bad: Would've loved a bit larger rooms. We ended up having to get a second room for our kids (older kids) since the suite was simply too tight for all of us. My husband said the mattress was about ready to be replaced. And we thought it was funny that there was a sign on the toiletries, saying that they would charge for these if taken home. But overall, we really had a great time and loved the environment. Good: Loved the staff - very friendly and helpful with good recommendations. We loved the attached restaurant for coffee and breakfast. The overall atmosphere was very cool and well done. And the location for us was great.
0	Security won't do anything about chronic noise from upstairs neighbor. I can't stay here again. Problem guest in the room upstairs from me and the security won't do a thing about it. Understandably, people will make noise in hotels, and it's something any hotel guest has to deal with. This is ridiculous, and if my only recourse is to point out how little the staff here cares about an unpleasant stay for guests, then I will do so in every available forum. Thanks for avoiding this place and not contributing to tolerance for disrespectful people. If it was just loud TV noise or whatever, I could deal, but this is constant running, stomping all evening long, and its not something I can tolerate.The Value Place team deeply apologizes for your negative experience during your stay with us. The issues you have mentioned will be addressed and handled. It is our mission to provide our guest with a positive experience, and in your case, we are deeply sorry that you were not pleased. We wish you the best.
0	Needs to be renovated!. As the saying goes you get what you pay for, not. I was only going to be in town for one night, so I thought I would just get a room that would not hurt the check book. I was not looking for luxury just accommodations. I got there around 3:45pm and the room was not cleaned yet. I reall... More
1	Golfer's Paradise. Our golf group decided to visit Orlando again this year. We stayed here from November 1-10. As a Marriott Associate from Niagara Falls, we were able to receive a discount. I still would have paid the rack rate at this property. Our three bedroom unit was perfect for us. We had all the amenities of home. We cooked in our unit about half the time and even used the BBQ twice. Supplies for beer and groceries were nearby. We found the Marriott staff to be helpful and very courteous. Hawks' Landing Golf course was a short drive by shuttle and very convenient. Other courses such Grande Pines were close as well. The facilities were first class. The unit obviously had been renovated with new counter tops, kitchen cupboards, marble in the bathrooms, and new appliances. The balcony overlooked a large pond with plenty of wildlife there. Each room had its own flat sreen TV. The only down side is the analog reception and no GOLF CHANNEL. The small pool area and hot tub next to unit was great. There is also a large pool area as well. Our group agreed that we would love to come back to Marriott's Imperial Palms.
0	Don't do it.. I booked 2 nights. Stayed 1 and got out. I was afraid to shower here. By far the worst place I have ever stayed. My window didn't close all the way. I use the term window loosely. It's basically a dorm room with a rickety door that doesn't close properly. The only redeeming quality is the staff. You leave a... More
1	Relaxing weekend!. My sis and I along with our Shih Tzu spent 2 nights 3 days at this hotel. We loved it! We didn't do anything but enjoy the hotel, ate great food and walked around. Our very comfortable room has a balcony which is so convenient for our Shih Tzu. The hospitality kit included 2 water bottles per day and a bottle of delicious red wine. The restaurants in the property are excellent. We plan to return. There's a 150 non refundable pet deposit and a 25 per day parking fee.Dear Maria A,Thank you for choosing to stay at Estancia. It was our pleasure to welcome you to our dog-friendly La Jolla resort and we are so pleased that your entire party enjoyed the comfort of our accommodations, our award-winning grounds, and the delicious cuisine served in our restaurants. Thank you for the excellent rating you have awarded us! We are looking forward to welcoming you back to Estancia soon for another relaxing getaway.
0	Do not stay here. Our upgraded balcony room over looked the dumpster. The housekeeping service was VERY POOR. The hotel billed for Wi Fi service that was not used. Towels were never replaced and we had to call for soap.
1	Fantastic Staff and Wonderful Facilities. For someone who had never visited New Orleans before, I could confidently say that the troubadour staff made me feel like I was at home. I was told about all of the fantastic restaurant and bars that weren't tourist traps. The front desk staff provided quite a bit of useful information about the city and were a fantastic resource that answered all of my questions. My room was always immaculate and the housekeeping team was able to accommodate all of my requests. I look forward to my next stay soon.Thank you for sharing your experience. We are excited you spent your first trip to the Big Easy with us. I'm very proud of the team here at The Troubadour and always enjoy reading when guest recognize all their efforts. Can't wait to see you on your next trip to NOLA!WayneGeneral Manager
1	A Great Place for a Convention!. Renaissance Atlanta Waverly Hotel Convention CenterI had the occasion to attend the Revolution Chiropractic Convention in Atlanta. The convention was held at the Renaissance Waverly Hotel, this is a Marriott Property.The Hotel was up to the Marriott Standard, the young lady that checked me in, I think her name was Leah, she was delightful as well as very helpful. The room was spacious and clean, and the convention rate made it reasonable for a Marriott property. The bed in the room was amazing, it was like sleeping on a cloud, wow! So comfortable! For one who likes to sleep in a very cold room, I was a little disappointed that the lowest the thermostat would go was 65! I dont know if thats normal, in most hotels the first thing I do is to turn the air down to 62.I tried the breakfast buffet the first morning I was there, a little steep at about 22, can anyone eat 22 worth of food for breakfast It was awesome, they had EVERYTHING imaginable on the table. I ordered room service one evening, the burger was good, the service was fast and courteous. I was a little surprised, I ordered soup and was not given any crackers! I tried to call down, but they were so busy the phone was not answered.Overall a very good stay, I would certainly visit this place again.It is wonderful to hear about your fantastic stay with us and we appreciate the great comments. We hope that your travels bring you back to stay with us again. Thank you!
0	DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL!!!. Last Saturday, we arrived on time and had paid through Hotels.com. Their is a wall-high GLASS that separates the customer from the check in clerks (first clue). The clerk was extremely slow and after 15 mins, still could not find our paid reservation on her computer. Meanwhile,a man walked in without a reservation, got a room and key and was... More
0	Not impressed. Stayed here on a few day holiday to Seattle. Location is pretty good so it has that. I also appreciate every hotel in Seattle is hugely expensive but this place is very high and for this sort of price I expect perfection and having stayed all over the world in top business hotels in major cities this was just poor comparedStaff on desk were very pretentious and i felt thought their hotel was above us, the internet was essentially unusable and it just did not feel welcomingMatthew L,Thank you for your comments. I would like to hear more about your experience with the front desk staff as they are such an essential part of the hotel experience. Please feel free to reach out to me via email so I can try to find where we can improve for our guests benefit. Best Regards, -Taylor England - Front Office Manager - tayloremayflowerpark.com
0	Not met with my expectation like other Hampton Inn Hotels. It is disappointing that this Hampton Inn falls below my expectation. The carpet is old and smelly, and the hallway is dark and unwelcoming, Filter in spa is always broken. Quality of breakfast is below average. The location is convenient to shopping and restaurant. It...More
1	On Business. The facility is beautiful and so close to restaurants.(Has one in the atrium) It's a little on the pricey side but its very secure. The staff with the exception of the lady at check in time were very nice and courteous. Checking out was smooth and the young man that helped with check out, more than made up for the check in experience.I appreciate you taking the time to complete a critique of my hotel. I am very pleased you enjoyed your stay but would love to learn more about your check in experience. If you have the chance, would like to talk to you via telephone, my number is 770 303 3186 and my name is Joe Uhl. Hope you have a wonderful Holiday!
1	Unique property in downtown Phoenix. The Found:Re is a truly unique experience. It is really an art gallery posing as a hotel. Wonderful pieces to view everywhere. I thoroughly enjoyed strolling the property to view the art. Great room on the 8th floor. The shower is awesome: not just a walk in but a sit in with a jack and jill sink. Nice bath amenities from Bigelow. Great bar with awesome bar keeps Maxwell and Kyle. I'd make a trip to Phoenix even in the summer just to stay here.Thank you! We are so happy to hear you had a great stay! Please visit again soon.
0	Sheraton is awful!. My girlfriends and I booked the sheraton for our weekend trip to Miami.. The hotel did not get our booking correct, we were not give a balcony room although we had booked one. They would not accommodate our requests to move to a balcony room and stated the entire hotel was sold out, so we sucked it up and went to the standard double room. Upon our arrival we were hit in the face with a SWELTERING, tiny room. The room temperature was above 90. We called the front desk and explained the problem only to be dismissed very quickly by rude staff again stating the hotel was sold out. They sent up the maintenance man who said he fixed it after trying for less than 10 mins. Three hours later room was still insanely hot, so we demanded a manager come up to check it out. Finally, two managers came and confirmed that the room was indeed unbearable and we weren't just complaining for no reason. Another 6 hours later, at around midnight, we were given a new room an upgrade to a suite - which was honestly a standard size room (whereas the first room which was supposed to be standard) was a sardine can size. The staff left our luggage in the lobby for hours before bringing it to our room at midnight and said they didn't know who it belonged to so they couldn't move it to a safe place. The staff was rude, the hotel is rundown, the rooms are tiny, the bars are gross, the pool water was disgusting. This hotel was just not good. I'd spend a little bit more of the money and stay elsewhere.
1	Great Airport Hotel. I've stayed at this hotel before and was pleased when Hotels.com again offered it at such a reasonable price. The hotel van comes promptly to the airport, check in was speedy and the room was clean and welcoming. The one issue was that I arrived at the hotel tired in the middle of the afternoon and the pool did not open until 6 PM. I get that they mostly get traveling businessmen but having the pool available in the afternoons would be a great advantage to work off some sore muscles and traveling frustration. Hotel itself though is great.
1	Great location and great service. We wanted a hotel in the French Quarter, and this one had the best price, with free wifi and breakfast, so we chose it. It was a good choice. The room was nice, with a fridge, and the hot breakfast was very good and filling, with eggs, waffles, bacon, sausage, etc. It was sort of at the beginning of the French Quarter, so it was not too loud, but it was easy to walk to Bourbon Street, Royal Street, etc. The staff was especially helpful. We only had two nights to stay, and were driving from natchez, so I called them on the way, and they booked us a city tour. The VIP tour was a great intro to the city, and booking it ahead like that saved us time and gave us something to do our first afternoon after arrival. All in all, this was a good trip and I would choose this hotel again.
0	DONT EVER STAY HERE!!!. The stay was for business and the room booked through my office. It was prepaid through Expedia. The room was FILTHY!!! Stains, burn marks, bugs, and it smelled terribly of smoke (booked a non-smoking room). The bathroom was extremely dirty and there was no way I could shower in it. One light in the room worked, all others did not. I video taped it because I had never experienced anything like this. I immediately went back to the manager and expressed my concern. He would not give me a refund so I told him I would take it up with my office and their credit card company. There was no way I was going to stay there. I drove home 2 hours and had to drive back the next day for my business event. It was that bad and I refused to stay there.
1	Nice design, friendly staff, but too expensive - and noisy plumming. Got a nice room (1715) on 17th floor, but woke up three times at night because somebody must have run the tap or had a shower. When having a shower in the beautful seperate shower cabin, twice I adjusted the water temperature, stood under the shower for a minute or so when the water got really scorchingly hot and I had to move away from it, turn down the temperature, almost turning the water off, wait a minute for it to cool down, then feel it got really cold. Back to the original setting and eventually enjoy the shower.Sorry guys, at 490 a night that's not okay. Noise plus burning yourself is not acceptable.One more thing I hate: Monday night 7.30, I want to go jogging and ask for steam room/sauna after jog. Answer: it's part of our Spa and admission is 20 for hotel guests - and it closes at 8pm on a Monday. Come on, guys, that's not okay for a 5 Star hotel. Not only having to pay - but closung at 8 doesn't work for business people!
0	Safety Concerns. The check in person at the front desk was very polite. I did not see the pool or grounds. The location is not bad. The rooms however opened out on common outdoor space. Simple locks. Deadbolt, chain and latches removed. Windows had simple latch. Probably a nice hotel but concern over safety. Moved on.
1	Exceptional Staff. My husband and I stayed at the Sorrento the night before leaving on and after returning from a cruise. So we got to see the hotel on a Friday and Saturday night a week apart.The staff was wonderful. When we arrived, they got our name from the luggage tags and were already getting us checked in before we even came in the hotel. The concierge was helpful in arranging scheduling the complementary town car service to the pier and area restaurants for us, as well as the dock for our cruise departure. They also picked us up when we returned.The hotel restaurant was good, though not exceptional. We had breakfast in the restaurant one morning and room service the other. Service was friendly.We were subject to a Sweet 16 party our 1st night in the hotel. We complained about the noise and when we returned for our 2nd night the next weekend, we were upgraded. We appreciated the gesture, however that weekend, a Bat Mitzvah was taking place. Also a very noisy occasion. So 2 young ladies enjoyed their big nights, while we did not.The hotel is lovely. The staff exceptional. Street noise is not a problem. Parties on the 7th floor - big problem. Great location - close enough to everything without being too close. The complementry car service is a big plus.
1	Great and Noisy Place to Stay. Hotel Solamar was a really nice hotel. The rooms were very cute and contemporary. Its kind of dark when you first walk into the hotel itself after being outside in sunny California. I didn't have to interact with the staff often but checking in and out was quick and they were friendly. I was happy that they allowed us to check in early without any problem. Since I'm from Texas, its not the norm to have to pay to park, especially 32 per day. So that was pretty steep and not pleasant. The valet guys were polite and tried to be quick in getting the car. Although I'd have preferred skipping the whole valet thing because I'd have saved money in the constant tips and it would've been faster. But I suspect that this was how it is at all the hotels in San Diego so I couldn't be that disappointed in the parking situation. The beds were comfortable and they had nice flat screen TVs. The rooms were very nicely decorated and I was impressed. The only odd thing was that there weren't any drawers. The bathrooms were also nice. I just love the Aveda toiletries that they provide. One complaint that I do have is that there is a nightclub in the building and around 11pm the music can be heard in the room for a few hours. Luckily I was tired enough to sleep through it but it is very loud. Overall, I wasn't disappointed and I'd probably stay there again but I'd ask for a room as far away from that club as possible.Thank's for your feedback.I am truly sorry that the music from our lounge keep you from a great night sleep. I am happy that your overall experience was positive. Thank's for staying with us.
1	Perfect location, wonderfully clean. This is an excellent property very, very close to the Orlando airport. We have stayed here several times before and find it a perfect place to begin a vacation or end one by the airport. Most of the rooms have finally gotten rid of those horrid dial a mattresses which are in many of the Hilton Gardens. The pool was sparkly clean, we had a good nights sleep. Check the prices as they change often.Dear Guest peanutsNewYork, I would like to thank you on behalf of my team at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport for taking the time out of your busy schedule and write a comment about our hotel and your experience during your stay. It is our pleasure and goal to make sure our guest have the perfect experience, either for business or for vacation excel your expectations is our daily goal. Also, it is very important and rewarding for us that due to our consistent service you have honored us with your loyalty. Every employee of this hotel prides themselves in the quality of their work striving for 101 to exceed our guest's expectations every day.We are looking forward to welcome you, family and friends to once again provide you with an outstanding level of service and nothing less. Sincerely,Alex BlancoGeneral Manager
0	Light sleepers do NOT come here. Ok so the only good thing about this place is they allow our furry friends. the room is semi nice, hardwood floor. BUT THE WALLS ARE SUPER THIN! You can hear everything everyone so clear as if they're all in your room. So guess who got no sleep -- it wasn't just at night, it was in... More
0	Wet carpert, cigar smoke, room intrusions and more. So I stayed there last week. At first blush it seems pretty similar to all these business hotel chains. I checked in about 5 p.m. and they gave me a room at the end of a looong walk down the corridor. OK, maybe they are full. Then I step into the room, put my carry-on on the dresser, take off... More
1	Good value. Always like the Hampton Inn for their great service and the free breakfast. The location is great close to the highway but not noisy. We got a room on the fourth floor, with clean and comfortable beds. Over the weekend the breakfast room got a little crowded, but there is still space in the lobby to sit down. Great to find parking space either in the garage or outside, they pointed out to us that they even offer Hilton Diamond member parking. The fitness room is small, but enough for your daily cardio. We definitely would come back if we need a place in Del Mar.
0	comfortable rooms yet horrible!. We stayed for one night after coming to and leaving from Alaska. Although they claim to have non smoking rooms, some of their rooms have been used for smoking before. Both times, we were given rooms that was smelly. The first time, we were given another room that was good but the sink was not draining properly. Since we were... More
1	I'll Stay Again. I stayed 4 nights while attending a conference elsewhere in the D.C. area. I was looking for reasonable price in the D.C. area and proximity to the Metro. The hotel met both needs. They provided a complimentary shuttle to the Metro (although I chose the 20 minute one time just for exercise). There were several good restaurants nearby. I enjoyed the fish restaurant nearby very much. I also chose fast food one night -- all within walking distance. I plan to stay there on a subsequent visit. I enjoyed the complimentary eggs and sausage each morning. (They had cereal also.) They are a little weak on facility maintenance but the room I had was fine.
0	Inviting and welcoming manager and staff. They go above and beyond to make every visitor comfortable.. We were visiting the hospital which is 1.2 miles away so it was perfect for us. We came back to the motel after visiting hours and were within half a block of a nice restaurant/pub. We just walked. Beautiful setting along the canal. Newark Garden included breakfast. Nice addition. This is not a new motel, but had warmth and charm.... More
0	Nice Place If You Don't Like Sleeping. This hotel gave me Room 232 next to the ice machine and the elevator. I stayed 2 nights, a Wednesday and a Thursday. The room was pretty clean. The room was dark with insufficient electric lighting. There was a safe in the room that didn't work. The noise from the hall sounded like a frat house with revelers coursing through... More
0	Cold and the mattress was awful.. Front counter friendly but the bed was very uncomfortable and the tub was dirty and drained slow.
0	Desk personnel were exceptional, room not!. We arrived at the hotel early and were offered a room near the elevator or we could wait a few hours (check in was 4pm this was 1000am)...we asked if we could park. We noticed signage indicating parking at the hotel was 20-30 per day (this wasn't indicated on the website). We did park in a tiny cramped undercover parking space and went back to the desk to inquire about the parking charge22.50 / day, though we didn't know how this amount was calculated. Again, very personable helpful assistance at the desk, full breakfast excellent, elevator musty, room not so clean, internet not working, one phone not working. Shower liner wasn't even hung, just fabric curtain AND YOU HAD TO RUN AROUND IN THE SHOWER JUST TO GET WET! POOR, POOR, POOR WATER PRESSURE!Thank you for taking the time to review our property. We appreciate your business.
1	Nice hotel near DC. The hotel was surprisingly good. Our room was very clean and spacious for 2 people. The bed was extremely comfortable. I especially liked the pillows that they provided. It gave just the right amount of support to my neck to relieve the stress and fatigue after roaming in scorching Washington DC heat on 4th July weekend (100 F). Hotel staff was super helpful. As soon as we checked into our room, within half an hour hotel attendant provided couple of extra towels without requesting. I especially liked this nice gesture because anyone tired of traveling in hot weather will take a nice bath and would need extra towels for early morning next day. Breakfast was average in terms of variety and quality. Neighborhood is definitely not good. There are couple of police cars always in the Hotel campus. So walking to Metro station is out of question. I wish the free hotel shuttle frequency to metro station was like every 10 mins instead of half an hour. It hardly takes 2 mins by shuttle to reach the metro station. But if you miss it (we did miss by couple of mins, while waiting for the elevator to arrive), you have to wait half an hour for next shuttle. All in all it was nice experience. I would definitely stay again.
0	Horrible!. I have stayed at The Chelsea once before in the nice tower. While trying to book my trip this time I was surprised. I booked my room online and thought I booked the nice new tower again since I kept clicking on The Chelsea and not the Annex. To my surprise when I arrived I walked into a dirty room with stains on the sheets. The chair in the room looked from the 70's with stains as well, was afraid to sit on the bed. When I returned to the front desk to speak with the manager and get a nicer room in the tower I booked or refund my money, he was very rude and arrogant. He refused to refund and said I booked wrong even though I kept telling him I kept clicking on The Chelsea. The customer service was horrible the room was dirty and needless to say I lost out on 240 for a poor quality room I did not spend the night. Don't go!!
1	Great Experience!. It was an awesome stay at this hotel. Very clean and comfortable. Spacious and staff very friendly. If I go back to Dallas I will be staying again. Dear Blanca G,Thank you for your kind words regarding your stay at the Hawthorn Suites Dallas Park Central. We were glad to have you as our guest, and appreciate you taking the time to comment regarding your visit with us. We look forward to the opportunity to host you again the next time you are in the Dallas area. Thanks again for being our guest! Best regards, Charlie Westhoven Operations Manager Hawthorn Suites Dallas Park Central
0	Location, location, location. Location is the only thing this place has going for it. The door didn't seal, the curtains didn't cover the whole window, the towels were so threadbare you felt like you were using paper towels, and the power outlets were so loose my charger kept falling out. The staff was friendly enough when prompted but didn't go out of their way. I also had to pay a 50 deposit that has not been returned yet.
0	not worth the stay. this hotel was dumpy. the layout was strange. I will probably never stay at a La Quinta again.
0	Not worth it!. If you want a relaxing vacation this is NOT for you. We came for a relaxing five days with our family for our anniversary. They didn't even congratulate us or do anything special for the room. Staff is rude and unprofessional and this place lacks big time on service. The pool is pretty but packed with drunk people and different... More

1	just like home away from home. this was a excellent choice for me and my family, we were there for 5 days and was not ready to leave. If ever back in New Orleans I won't have to look far for a nice place to reside while I'm here.I took the time to do a review because I often read them to help me make a decision. Only one thing I didn't like but every h.tel now does it is a 20.00 or more to park in their parking lot. If you are there for more than three days I think there should be a charge. So only 1 complaint for a 5 day stay is pretty darn good,
0	Awful Customer Service - Worst Airport Shuttle Service. I try to be fair and objective in my TripAdvisor reviews, because I take others' reviews seriously when booking a hotel. Unfortunately, the Wyndham Garden Elk Grove Village has been one of the worst examples of bad customer service I have ever encountered. The hotel's bad customer service, and even worse shuttle service left our party out an extra 70,... More
1	Great Place to Stay in Atlanta. This hotel provided a great stay. Conveniently located near 1-75. For being close, the room was very comfortable and quiet. The bed was very comfortable as well. From the moment I walked into the hotel, there was a smiling face holding the door open for me. I was also able to check in early since my meetings were finished. Again, the staff was very nice at check in. They gave me a can of coke and a bottle of water. The little things are very nice and appreciated. The concierge lounge was nice as was the variety of food. I'm enjoyed the shrimp, pasta and asparagus. The breakfast also was nice as well.I am glad you enjoyed your stay with us, hope to see you soon!
0	Handicap-accessible OR pet - friendly but not both!. Reservation was made in advance via the Best Western 1-800 number for a room that is both mobility accessible and pet friendly, and the e-mail I received confirmed that. When we arrived about 8:00 PM after driving all day, the desk clerk told me that all the handicap accessible rooms are not pet friendly and all the pet friendly rooms... More

1	Breakfast. We stopped in for breakfast before our cruise.Very nice hotel and restaurant, great service, food was great!The reason for four stars... My cream pitcher had mold in it.They replaced it and apologized and also removed the charge from our bill. I was not too concerned as mold is not life threatening lol.Dear Lionel P,Thank you for sharing your review of your recent visit to The St. Regis San Francisco. I sincerely apologize for your experience at breakfast, and appreciate your understanding. Please do not hesitate to contact me directly prior to your next stay in San Francisco, as we hope to welcome you back soon.Sincerely,Andre BroseHotel Manager415-284-4057Andre.Brosestregis.com
0	Review of Wingate At Alphretta, Ga.. This facility need to be renovated badly. Its has a lot of problems with the rooms, and management doesn't seem to do anything when told.
1	Beautiful!. Beautiful Hotel in a beautiful location. Local to everything that San Diego is known for. The property and the staff help make it a beautiful vacation experience. It is part of Old Town, San Diego, which offers historical sites, shopping and great restaurants. The Hotel is central to all San Diego attractions. It is so quiet and peaceful at night.Thank you! I enjoyed your sentiment, It is so quiet and peaceful at night. This is the type of relaxing and comfortable environment we strive for. And indeed, we are in the heart of Old Town, walking distance to numerous restaurants, museums, parks, unique shops and the train station. We cant wait for you to return!
0	Looks good on a picture. I chose this hotel only so we can accommodate 2 more adults. The door locks were broken. Each time we left the room, we had to arrange for a employee to open the door for us. Room was smelly (mould like smell). The room was small. The jacuzzi was terrible foamy like someone would put a bottle of shampoo there. The location was very good. Just minutes to the Disney park. Breakfast poor and locked up right at 9 am so no sleeping in. Next time I'll go for 2 rooms in other hotel.
0	Deplorable. Should have checked Trip Advisor before staying here. Besides being dirty there were holes in bed linens, paint on floor and door handle, tub wouldn't drain and TV had no signal. The worst motel we have stayed in.
1	Pre-cruise stay. Needed a place to stay before Baltimore based cruise. Hotel could use a shuttle service to the pier like other hotels in the area. Also need a direct phone line from the airport to hotel for shuttle service like other hotels and services. If I hadn't brought along the phone number, I would have been stuck. Wish there were other restaurants nearby. Also need a better selection of drinks for managers reception--I have stayed at many other Em. Suites and have had a much better selection--also bartenders were a little surly and the place wasn't really that crowded. Snacks catered to Vegans. Front desk personnel were extremely helpful--above and beyond the call of duty.
0	Dated and tired. Check in staff were condescending when asking which room we had and made us feel less valued due to booking a budget room. General cleanliness of the room was ok, but a few hairs were found on the towels. The rooms also have very thin walls. The free parking and location to Heavenly was very good along with the proximity... More
1	Quick, but Nice. Had a quick stay here last week. Very nice overall.Check in was quick and easy. Was in my room within 10 minutes of walking into the hotel. Very nice room upgrade given. Concierge level room with great views of Midtown/Downtown as well as part of the Buckhead skyline. Room was large with a separate sitting area with couch, chair, and coffee table. Work desk was large and bed was comfortable and provided a great rest. The bathroom was spacious also. Had a separate tub and shower, with marble floors/sink. As I was only here for a brief time, I did not get a chance to check out the fitness or pool areas. Also did not have any experience with room service or hotel restaurant dining. I did have a couple of drinks in the hotel bar, and the service was friendly and efficient. For being surrounded by a huge mall with a lot of parking, I was a little disappointed that this hotel charged 17/day for parking. I live in Atlanta so I don't often stay in hotels in the area. If and when I need a Buckhead hotel again, this will be my choice. Prices generally seem more reasonable than some other hotels in the area with similar levels of quality service.
0	150 a day is ridiculous. IF YOU BOOK THERE BE PREPAIRED! YOU NEED AN EXTRA 150 A DAY. In addition to the 35 Resort Fee. And to top it off my room isn't ready. Staying here is like having a pretty girl with an ugly attitude. It only looks good on the outside. The management is terrible
1	Perfect for families. We stayed in a two bedroom apartment during our stay in Anaheim in June 2004. We have two young children (3 and 5). The apartment was clean and well equipped. The beds were comfy and the linen fresh. We loved the location, near Dennys, Starbucks, Panda Express and Mc Donalds. We made our booking on the net from Australia and found our requests had been answered perfectly. ( A corner non-smoking room). Another great feature was the free parking and free shuttle to Disneyland. There were three T.V.'s all having cable, which the kids loved. There was a bath, lots of towels. I highly recommend this hotel to families with young children, we were very impressed.
0	It was so bad, I slept in my car. (I wish I was joking.). This hotel is falling apart, and the staff doesn't seem to care. The first room we were put in had a broken AC unit, and the room it self was filthy. when I advised the hotel staff, they had me bring in a large industrial fan for the room. It was so loud that we decided we should change rooms.... More

0	Not what we expected. We have previously stayed at the Palms Hotel with a beachfront room, but they are closed all summer for renovations, so we went a couple of buildings down to Seaside Inn expecting a smaller room but similar accommodations, so much of this critique is comparing Seaside to the Palms. We had a beachfront room and although the balcony was spacious... More

0	BE FOREWARNED I WAS ROBBED AT THIS HOTEL. DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL. I left my room for an hour after I checked in and someone went in my room and stole my laptop and my suitecase and the hotel took ZERO responsibility for the incident. NOT A SAFE PLACE!!!!I would like to apologize once again for the incident that occurred earlier this month. I have turned over all pertinent documentation to our Risk Management department. Any future correspondence will be addressed by our Risk Management Team.
0	poor. this is not a 3 star hotel - on top of cleanliness issues, we had a two issues with wake up calls. One 2 hours early and the other which didn't come at all.
1	Vacation. My visit to the best Western mission bay was great. Once I arrived the stay was friendly and fast, in addition lead my family to local areas foe food seeing we've never been in the area. The room was clean and the beds were so comfortable it felt like sleeping on a marshmallow. In the morning the breakfast area was pack but I understand why, with the waffle maker eggs bacon cereal biscuits gravy yogurts who wouldn't want to dine in for breakfast there.Good Afternoon,Thank you so much for taking the time to review your stay with us here at the Best Western Mission Bay.I am happy to see that you were thrilled with our comfortable beds, rooms and breakfast. Thank you so much for your compliments to our staff, Im glad everyone was friendly and helpful. We strive to deliver superior customer care, and intend to do that through our excellent team members.When you return to San Diego area, please feel free to contact me directly for your reservation needs. You can reach me at 619-275-5700 ext 393 or Lpradohotelpros.biz.We look forward to your return,Leidy PradoFront Office Manager
0	Yes you DO get what you pay for!!!!. Well...this was a much different experience than the red roof inn just 1 mile down the street. From the outside this place looks new. And has an indoor heated pool advertisement says...well i never got over to it. This place is OLD, VERY OLD...was a days Inn, and a Best Western prior to that!. WOW the walls in the room... More
1	Top Hotel. The Mayflower Park hotel is located in a great place if you like to walk around the attractions of Seattle. Easy access by light rail from the airport,about halfan hours travel and frequent departures. Only one and a half block away from the station.Three blocks away from Pike Market Place, one block from the tramway to Union lake and close to shopping. The staff are very helpful and friendly.The hotel is one of the historic Hotels of the USA and has been beautifully maintained and refurbished.I stayed there twice and was very happy with my rooms, which were spacious and well appointed.
1	Great Family Stay Before A Cruise. No surprises here, a great stay at this Courtyard! We were in town for 2 days prior to boarding our cruise and we loved our stay. For two adults, a child and a senior everyone was happy. The room was clean and nice size. The view of Lake Union from our room was beautiful and the location was great! Gym, great for the stay!Food in the restaurant, served its purpose and great to be on site!Service, fantasic!Very Happy with this stay!Thank you so much for your wonderful review! We are so happy to hear you enjoyed your stay with us before your cruise and hope to see you next time your travels bring you to Seattle!Sincerely,Rachel Packard
0	Not Maintained. Ants on counters, flattened mattresses, stained sheets, room was dirty (especially couch), sinks had rust, TVs had bad cable connection (fuzzy), bar was closed, hot tub had been filled in as a planter, and pool tables were on uneven surface. However, the courtyard was beautiful, pool was great, breakfast was good, and it was right across from Busch Gardens.
0	40,000 Points down the drain. Room is nice but everything else was terrible. First off the hallway smelt like a 1970's hippie convention. Yes I am aware that It's legal in Washington State but I thought no smoking in the hotel would also cover that as well. The worst issue was the free breakfast. The breakfast attendant must have decided to save the hotel... More
1	Cool Hotel, Great Vibe, Smallish rooms. Loved this hotel. I stayed her on business a few months ago. It's a great location. And you can walk to almost anywhere from here. The bar is really nice and they do happy hour too! The hotel is a little older but super well maintained. The wifi is great too. Rooms are therefore not your standard USA size, a little smaller, think European Chain type sizes. Breakfast in the restaurant was great, service a little low but worth the wait.Happy to hear you enjoyed your stay and we look forward to welcoming you back in the future!Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager
1	Ocean Park Inn earns our go-to destination. It was our first visit to San Diego and after some extended searches looking for the perfect places to stay, we hit a home run with the Ocean Park Inn. Its located right next to Pacific Beach and walking distance to many places to eat and drink. The staff was welcoming and friendly. Our room was very clean comfortable, with a great view the ocean. Though we made reservations for a partial view, I believe we received a slight upgrade...as our view was wonderful. We were lucky to have Pat and Jasmine working the front desk when we checked-in, they were very accommodating in taking time to provide us an orientation of the area and attractions. We can't wait to make a return trip!!
1	Wedding Ocean Park Inn. Ocean Park Inn was the only hotel in Pacific Beach that was willing to help us pull off our wedding, exactly the way we envisioned.We traveled to San Diego to scout a location on Pacific Beach to host our wedding. We had a very specific plan in mind. We wanted all of our guests to stay at a beach side hotel, we wanted to get married in the sand, then host our reception at the courtyard of the hotel. We wanted to serve tacos from a roadside taco stand, Two Buck Chuck (2 Wine from Trader Joe's), and beer from a keg.We quickly found out that this type of wedding does not happen in Pacific Beach. First of all, the City of San Diego doesn't allow weddings in the sand at Pacific Beach. Next, we inquired with every hotel along the beach that had a courtyard. Not one of the hotels was willing to accommodate us according to our specific plans. We checked Best Western (not willing to host the reception), The Surfer (not willing to consider any of it), The Cottages (respectfully unwilling to disrupt their elderly guests), Crystal Pier (a simple lack of willingness to try something innovative), Tower 23 (wanted a monstrous minimum for the courtyard and would not allow us to bring the taco stand), and Pacific Terrace (unwilling to host the reception).Ocean Park Inn was the only hotel that was completely willing to fully accommodate our requests. Only they know the secret to convincing the City of San Diego into giving us a permit for a Pacific Beach wedding. They offered an amazing group discount. They helped us organize discounts from local businesses to share with our guests. They worked with us every step of the way through a planning process that lasted 10 months.Quite simply, OPI tried something innovative and they knocked it out of the park!Everyone here at the Ocean Park Inn was so happy to see your wedding day go off without a hitch! It was an absolute thrill working with you, from the early planning to cleanup, and we all wish you both a very happy marriage! Thank you again for choosing the Ocean Park Inn, and please let us know if you're ever in town again!
1	Friendly and welcoming. A great welcome to this small, comfortable hotel. We had a nice, good sized room (complete with goldfish). Didn't eat in the restaurant but saw lots of people, mostly local, enjoying what looked like excellent food. They don't do breakfast but there are some good places nearby and they do provide excellent free coffee in the lobby. Overall a pleasant stay and would probably use again if in the area.Thank you for the kind review. We appreciate your support. We hope you can come back for a visit and try our great restaurant. Please tell a friend. Make it an amazing day.
0	What a difference a year makes.. We have stayed at The Whitney before, but had no idea that the hotel no longer had a bar nor restaurant. This is a sad commentary, since we enjoyed the hotel last year, and were looking forward to another visit. The staff was again cooperative, understanding, and friendly. But, the sink had only a trickle for water flow, and the engineer could not fix the problem. And, we were there for 5 ngts. I'm sorry to hear you did not enjoy your stay. There were some service issues with the previous food and beverage operation, which was contracted through a 3rd party. Due to this, a change was made and the hotel has started offering a free continental breakfast. While we've received mostly positive feedback about the change, we understand that some like a full service restaurant inside the hotel. Plans to reopen the bar are underway and with all the wonderful dining options in walking distance of the Hotel, our Front Desk team will always have a great recommendation for you. Thank you again for your feedback and we hope you come back and see us next year. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
0	Basic. Basic. Basic.. This place is as basic an accommodation as you can get in downtown Atlanta while still being suitable. Yes there is free parking but this place is so cheap that they don't even give you free shampoo in the bathroom - just two little bars of facial soap. Place isn't in the greatest area (downtown Atlanta is kind of sketchy at night) but is centrally located. For a healthy restaurant nearby I recommend Metrofresh - it's less than a ten minute drive and totally worth it! Basic cheap motel quality beds, old TVs, frustrating elevator that takes forever to close and absolutely NO FRILLS. Got it for 53/night using a coupon code on the Motel6 website.
0	The dark rooms and ancient furnishings were a turnoff.. This seems like a great value when compared with other area hotels, but it's worth the extra drive to Spokane Valley or Coeur d'alene. The rooms are large, but very dark and old. It smells old and musty. There seemed to be plenty for the kids to do though a swimming pool, arcade, etc. The night staff was friendly, but... More
0	Read this first. Was hesitant about this hotel after reading some of the reviews and my fears came to life as soon as we checked in. We had a room on the first floor with a kitchenette which smelled awful - evidently a souvenier from the last meal cooked there. The hotel is very outdated. I was told by the very nice desk clerk (who took me around the hotel attempting to find us another room) that they are in the process of updating Not to sure about that. Hotel is right on the strand. There is no A/C in the hallways and it appears that windows are usually kept open. We were supposed to stay two nights but left after one. Probably a great place for families on a budget with small children. Oh yeah, continental breakfast is juice boxes and poptarts basically. It is a good location though.
0	Evening social. The food at the evening social was inadequate. Food provided was boiled hot dogs, stale hot dog buns, salad with only lettuce and cheese, and no chips. The most disappointing evening social meal that I've ever had at a Homewood suites.
1	5 stars and I do mean 5!!!!!. We went to S.F. for my childhood best friend's birthday. She had never been before. I spent many hours researching all hotels in San Francisco (many years have passed since I was last there) and came across CMI while researching. Let me say that this place was exceptional! Why Because it was 3 very short blocks to Fisherman's Wharf, one diagonal short block to the Powell/Mason cable line turnaround, super clean - no rips, stains, dirt, anywhere, large and to my utmost surprise, SUPER QUIET. No noise from other travelers (who gets lucky enough to not be able to hear other people staying in the building Very RARE). Outside was quiet at night (countless reviews complain of outside noise in other places). The staff (all of the ones we encountered - 3 or 4 male) bent over backwards to help make our trip a great one. Large bathroom, large room. This was one of the least expensive places for the area, value and room size, AND there is complimentary (FREE) parking (clean, well lit) and no resort fees!! Just those two alone can add up to 100 nightly to your room!! Wifi was also free and no issues using it at all (I read this is a huge issue at various other places). We will most definitely stay at this place again. Trips like this one are what memories of a lifetime are created from. Thank you for being a huge part of such a wonderful experience. Thank you for everything! Super happy customers!!! My friend is still talking about how perfect it all was.
1	Fantastic hotel - great location, great restaurants, right on the beach. This is the third time we have stayed at the Reef. We stay in partial ocean view rooms and twice stayed in the Ocean Tower and once in the Pacific Tower. Both are very nice and rooms and hotel are all newly renovated to a high standard with quality furnishings. The hotel has great restaurants, The Shorebird, Ocean House and Kani Kapa Grill. All have beautiful food and great ambience. The pool is good and clean and of course you are literally on the beach which is a lot quieter than at the main Waikiki beach. The Boardwalk shops and restaurants are a few minutes walk away and have a great selection of shopping. Recommend these restaurants - Cheeseburgers, Ruth Chris Steakhouse, P F Chang as well as hotel restaurants. A walk up Diamond Head is worth it and the submarine tour which leaves from the Hyatt nearby. Hotel is beautifully decorated and the rooms and restaurants etc are great. We will stay here again. We recommended this hotel to other friends who enjoyed their stays here as well.
1	Southern Hospitality at its core. I am currently in house and felt in necessary to write a review immediately. This hotel is amazing and I would recommend it to any and everyone staying in NOLA. The entire staff is fantastic and friendly. Even prior to arrival, their service was seamless. I had to send a credit card authorization because my wallet was stolen and it was handled by the staff in no time at all. I even mentioned that I was arriving super early in the morning and I arrived at 9am to find my room was already checked in and waiting for me, which was so beyond my request. It is hip, trendy, fun, lively and worth every dollar. The room, while on a low floor, is perfect. I had a problem with my television, which I normally need to sleep and even though it was late and the staff could not immediately rectify the issue, it was the way it was handled that truly made all the difference. I could not be more pleased. I will say one thing.. a word to the wise, if you will. Bourbon Street will get you every time. I was somehow hungover by 6pm. Drink Responsibly.
0	Worst Hotel Experience. I have never had such a horrible hotel experience! I booked straight through their website, not a travel website. The room I booked was a 2 bedroom suite that clearly stated it has a king and 2 double beds. We arrived late after a long day at Busch Gardens on the day after Christmas. Check in took awhile but that... More
1	Lovely hotel, great location. We had 2 nights here in November and had a lovely time. Staff were very friendly, hotel clean and modern, bed very comfortable. We didn't eat here, but plenty of diners and restaurants near by.Location for shopping in Union square was great, Macys was a 5 minute walk away. We walked to fisherman's Warf on the first day but wouldn't recommend it as it was quite a hike and not particularly scenic, the cab back was around 20.We travelled to the hotel early on a Friday morning by Bart, the ticket was around 8 each from the airport and th Bart station was approx. 10 mins walk to the hotel, but our return flight was late at night so we used the hotel airport shuttle with I think was around 38 for the 2 of us, great service.
1	Re-Vamped Mid-century Motel with Luxury Fun. We saw the review of The Pearl in Sunset Magazine and thought it would be a great place to stay in San Diego. We stayed at The Grant last visit and loved it, but wanted a different local and experience. We were very happy with our choice. The atmosphere is fun and the dcor makes you feel like you are on a beach weekend from the 60's. Sparkling clean and comfortable. Excellent front desk personnel...the women could not have been more friendly, welcoming always with a smile. They know everything from the local restaurants and even directions to the stadium. (I asked for their names, but misplaced the card.) We stayed 11/21, 22. 23 and celebrated our anniversary with a drink on the house.It is 10 a night to park on the property which worked for us. Everything is centered around the pool. You can hear the bar restaurant noise, but everything gets quiet around 11:00. We liked hearing the laughter and vitality. Give it a try. We now Love The Pearl...thanks for the pins.On behalf of the entire Pearl crew management team, THANK YOU for your fantastic review. First off, Happy Anniversary! We truly appreciate you and are honored that you chose to stay with us. The vitality you felt is so true - a combination of great guests like yourselves and an awesome staff. We'll pass along your kind words to the front desk team. Please come again and tell a friend. Make it an amazing day!
0	Eh. My family and I stayed here for the weekend to do the Across the Bay 10k events. The hotel is older and the condition shows it. Furniture and carpet show many signs of wear and tear. The pool was not open because it was November. The front desk was very friendly and helpful when we called down or stopped to ask questions. Maid service did an excellent job of cleaning, making the beds, and giving us fresh bath supplies. Breakfast was very yummy with many different options. There is a grocery store, gas station, and place to eat all within walking distance. The neighborhood didn't seem the best at night so we stayed in the room when it got late. The room doors are all on the outside of the building which I really don't care for due to safety. Overall not terrible but you get what you pay for and I was trying to save a few dollars.
1	I Liked This Place!. I'm from L.A. and every year I teach here in S.F.and I'm put up in another place (can't remember the name) - This year I was put up at the Diva and I loved it. A very old building with a very new flair.Very Mercer-New York like. Modern. Everything was new, comfortable, worked. Granted there's no view, but why do you need a view when you're in San Francisco Go walk!Convenient to everything. Especially the lively Union Square. Great restaurants, the nightlife. Are you kidding For these prices You have to be nuts to stay anywhere else. I'm shocked that this is ranked (as of this writing) 47.The hotel front desk was very friendly and I even bought a DIVA T-Shirt (okay, okay, so it says SEXY on the back)Try it out. It's a hundred plus bucks in San Francisco! I saw these prices for Labor Day and am trying to talk my wife to going back. (She wants to go to Palm Springs. Ugh!)
1	Good value for location. It's not the swankiest hotel in San Francisco but it's in a good location and reasonably priced in the area (compared to other 400+/night). It's right down the street from Chinatown gate so you can easily grab some dim sum for brunch, close to cable car line that takes you to Fisherman Wharf, and close to Union Square shopping. Service was great- I arrived much earlier than normal check-in 11am fortunately they had a room available to check in to which was much appreciated. Room was very clean and comfortable. We also received 10 free minibar which was a nice bonus. Overall a nice stay for our one night in San Francisco.
0	Disappointed 2nd visit did not match prior visit. The rooms had 2 double beds instead of 2 queen beds and there were no available cribs or cots for our room. The TV in our room did not work. Other guests were quite loud into the night.
0	unflushed toilet. The toilet had not been flushed. The woman at the front desk did want to reimburse me some of my money, but said she had to call Hotels.com to do that.
1	Boutique hotel experience in a great location!. It was my cousin and I's first trip to San Francisco and we chose this hotel for its location and were not disappointed. In the morning, when we opened the windows/doors to our balcony, we could not only see the bay, breath in the fresh air of the sea, but even hear the sea lions. A walking distance from Fisherman's Wharf and Pier 39 and all the restaurants, it made it easy at the end of the day to just enjoy a relaxing evening, and do a little shopping. And it was just a short walk to Alcatraz's landing site and the cable car's main station. Even the famous Lombard street was a walking distance, and we could also see the Coit Tower from our balcony. And with lots of retro street cars and buses nearby, it made it easy to go visit further attractions in the city. The hotel is also very cleverly decorated like a ship, with porthole windows and bathroom mirrors, which made us feel like we were on a cruise. And the lobby recycled old containers to make up the walls, to add to the whole experience. We also enjoyed the convenience of the food truck in the yard, for snacks and drinks, but especially enjoyed sitting on the couches by the fire pits to end our days. Although a little pricy, all in all, we were happy with our choice, which made our first visit to San Francisco even better.Hi isabelledV4289FJ,First visits to San Francisco are always memorable, we are so glad we could be such a positive part of your memory. We hope we are always your go to hotel from now on. Keep your eye out for our monthly newsletter and special offers for our previous guests.Safe Travels, Jason
0	Terrible Service. Had to wait 45 minutes for the airport shuttle. Toilet ran all night. Breakfast area was dirty. Breakfast order was wrong. Had to get up and ask for more coffee. Coffee creamer was spoiled. And... nobody seemed to care.Hello howardtietjen:Thank you for sharing your concerns regarding your stay with us. We were sorry to read that things did not go as well as they should have, and our associates were not attentive to your needs and were not responsive to your complaints. We can assure you that this will be addressed with the proper team members so that this is not repeated again. Thank you again for sharing your observations, and please let me know if your plans return you to this area, as I would like to personally see to your reservation needs. We hope to welcome you back again soon!Sincerely,Michael GoldwasserGeneral Manager

0	Hotel Nightmare. Needs Improvement,Our room had a odor, the toliet leak, the room was not clean that well.
1	Excellent if you have a ocean front room. We stayed here for six nights in December. The porters on arrival were excellent. We arrived with a rental car and the porter told us exactly where to take the car to return it and took care of the luggage straight away.We wanted to see the ocean from the room so booked an ocean-view room. We were allocated an ocean view room in the Pacific Tower. I knew from the reviews that the partial ocean view rooms only had a view from the balcony, but I thought that if we paid the extra for the ocean view we would see the ocean. This is not the case. So I have no idea what the difference is between partial ocean view and ocean view except the price.So on arrival into our ocean view room, I wasn't happy, so I called the desk and was told I would need to upgrade to an ocean front room if I want to see the ocean from the room. So we paid the extra and upgraded. We were allocated room 619 of the Ocean Tower. The view from the ocean front room was beautiful as you would expect. Great view of the gorgeous sunsets and we left the doors open of a night to hear the ocean which was really nice. Unfortunately every morning at around 4am a couple of people (possibly staff) decided to have a loud conversation on the beachfront right below our room.The rooms in the hotel are very nice, in excellent condition, with good sized bathrooms (shower is over the bath), in a good location.The lobby is lovely, the staff are friendly. Our room wasn't serviced on one of the days, so I called the front desk and they sent someone to service the room.The pool was absolutely freezing. I was really looking forward to having a swim, but it was just too cold. However there is a very hot spa pool. The pool service is good, with staff offering bar service.The restaurants in the hotel were good. I have reviewed them separately.

1	So glad we stayed here.. Our family of 3 stayed here for 4 nights in late December. The whole experience from arrival to departure was enjoyable. We arrived at the hotel before lunchtime, and were pleasantly surprised to be able to go straight up to our room. The young woman who checked us in (Jamie) was so welcoming and friendly, we felt at home instantly. She even gave us a great recommendation for lunch, which we took, and enjoyed. Our room was on the 6th floor. It was large and well set out. We had 2 comfortable double beds , an armchair, desk, large screen TV, fridge, coffee maker and toiletries. The included breakfast was plentiful. Not a huge choice, but we always found something we enjoyed. It was busy during our stay so some mornings it was hard to find anywhere to sit, but one thing I will mention is the manager(s) were always making sure tables were cleaned briskly, so the wait was never too long. I found seeing management level doing this task and mingling with the people staying at the hotel a really nice touch. They always made time to ask about your day, and seemed to genuinely be interested in what you had to say. The nightly 'kickback' was another nice touch. We usually just had a nibble on the chips or popcorn,as had already eaten enough during the day, but it was fun to meet fellow holiday makers and hear about where they were from, or ideas of what to do around New Orleans. All in all I can not fault this hotel at all. Well done Drury Inn New Orleans for a efficiently run hotel with welcoming and friendly staff. Keep up the great work.
1	An excellent location for your stay in NO!. Have stayed here twice, and definite improvements were made since the first time. Full hot breakfast, awesome location, great service. Stay during the middle of the week to avoid the weekend upcharges, and become a BW member so you get the free parking!I'm glad to read you were pleased with the changes that have been made at the hotel! Coming during the middle of the week is a great tip. It is less crowded, but there is still always something going on in the city!Also, parking is always included in our rate whether a guest is a Best Western Rewards member or not, but thank you for becoming a member! Thank you for reviewing your stay, and we will see you the next time you visit New Orleans!Kathleen Davis, Front Office Manager
0	Worst hotel ever!! Warning!!. Warning:. Do not stay here if you have kids or simply don't mind having others watch you in your room through peepholes. Oct 13th to 16th stay. Peephole discovered above light, which is above sink in room 507. Sheriff's Dept. Notified at 830 am next morning. Staff didn't care and in fact smirked as though they didn't believe it. Corporate responded by email to my complaint stating that since credit card company agreed to reverse charges and police had been contacted, they weren't going to pursue matter, implying somehow that I shouldn't have told in them. Absolutely gross! You have been warned! Stay at own risk! I will update further once the police investigation has completed. Check out the pics of the room, 507. Attached.We are sorry to hear that your recent stay with us did not exceed your expectations. We appreciate your feedback and will use it to make improvements to offer guests a better experience in the future. We hope you will give us another chance and stay with us again. -Best Western Hotels Resorts
1	What a wonderful place to relax!. This little hotel offers one of the most relaxing atmospheres I've experienced, without the cost or the high end attitudes. The staff were so very helpful and friendly. We arrived early, and they had a secure area to store our bags and maps waiting at the front along with cucumber infused water and fresh coffee. While this is not like the usual Hilton style, I prefer this setting to any large chain hotel. The location was absolutely perfect....just a couple blocks from Little Italy and China Town, restaurants, the wharf, etc. Love it! Thank you San Remo!!!!
1	1st Trip to Napa. We arrived around noon and check-in was not until 4 pm and they gave us room immediately. The room was very large and clean with a balcony. All the staff were friendly and helpful. I am a member of the Gold Crown Club for Best Western and I have been very pleased with the hotels and the prices. Nice to have a Denny's on the property also. I would definately stay there again if ever in the area.We are glad we were able to check you in early. We apprieciate you being a Rewards Member! Membership has its perks. As you know early check ins, late check outs and even free room upgrades when available. We have also just started a full free hot breakfast in the newly remodeled Denny's on our property. Hope to see you on your 2nd trip to Napa.
0	awful stay. very unfriendly managers. kind of dirty. old heating systems. not enough hot water for bathing not much to mention about their stale food. sheets were not clean nor was the pillows . the carpet had a smell of dirty socks . there just is or was anything good about the place. I should have saved my 125.00 plus tax and... More
0	Worst JW Marriott. Staff and facility not impressive. No hot water in room. Contacted maintenance and the guy came up to my room and said yep, no hot water.... it happens he told me that it should be better in the morning. Guess what, I had to take a cold shower next morning.They billed me for long distance calls that I never made. I haven't made an outside call from a hotel since the mobile phone age. I have called the accounting department multiple times to get the charge removed and still haven't been successful.I could go on, but the bottom line is this is a second tier hotel, not up to the JW brand name.Thank you for taking the time to review the hotel. I am sincerely sorry about your hot water issues experienced, your billing issues for phone calls and the service failures once reported. Rest assured I will follow up with our teams for immediate attention. I am hopeful you will feel free to contact me directly so that I can ensure your charges have been removed for the calls and to discuss your stay further. We take your feedback very seriously and strive to provide exceptional service. The service you received is not a standard for the JW Marriott Atlanta. I look forward to hearing for your.
0	Could use a lesson in courtesy. Room was filthy. Staff was mediocre. Stained sheets, used medicine cups in drawer, filters full of dust and leaky shower. Place is a dump and not worth the price. Would not recommend to anyone, especially if you are traveling with kids. Dear Bobby,Thank you for your feedback. We take our guest comments very seriously and always strive to provide comfortable and friendly accommodations. Were sorry we fell below your expectation regarding cleanliness, carpet condition, bathroom amenities and bathroom cleanliness which was unacceptable. We will address these concerns. I assure you that the feedback of our hotel will be reviewed and most certainly forwarded to the appropriate departments. We take the confidence our guests place in us very seriously and work diligently to rectify any unsatisfactory experiences. We hope you give us a chance in the future to show you how great our hotel is.Sincerely,
0	Over priced. We have stayed here 4 nights and its a very basic hotel. It is overly priced even 4th night was free. I dont mind spending some extra money if hotel was worth it. No added amenities, just a small room, leaking sink, and no ocean view. The Sheraton hotel nearby appears to be much nicer. The only thing that I liked was location.
1	Location, location, location. Great hotel in the middle of everything San Francisco. I walked to world class dining and shopping. A couple of blocks from Chinatown and around the corner was the cable car, municipal buses, and the BART. I parked my car with the valet and didn't use it again until I checked out.The staff was genuine, friendly, and helpful. Sitting in the lobby with coffee and the morning paper was a joy.I want to know how and why the hotel smells like cookies, except in my room, which smelled fresh and clean.It was fun and restful, a hard combination to achieve.
1	Satisfies you need. Perfect location if going to visit Disneyland. No frills but safe, clean and family appropriate. Breakfast is grab and go but there is a Denny's Restaurant on location. Nice clean pool and separate hot tub. Friendly staff always willing to help and advise. No extra charge for parking. Did not use shuttle, as we simply walked across the street to enter Disneyland via Downtown Disney. Would recommend this hotel to all my friends and family.Thank you for your stay with us at the Best Western Pavilions. We are pleased you enjoyed our hotel and location. We hope to see you again on your next trip to the Anaheim area. Thank you again.
0	OVERCHARGE YOUR ACCOUNT!!! BE AWARE. I booked my stay here for my birthday weekend March 28th-March 30th through booking.com The hotel was clean, and the front desk reps/cleaning crew was very nice and cheerful! The stay there wasn't bad at all, well....that's until I got home and two days later I check my bank account to see that I was charged for a total of 3nights instead of 2. When I called to inquire about this. I spoke to Jenny, the same nice,cheerful rep I saw when I checked in. I guess that was a front! She was very RUDE! She was talking over me and insisted it was a bank error and not Hampton Inn fault. She kept saying what does your reciet say I told her the recit states the correct amount, however, I was charged a addional night. She still was rude and nasty! I asked ti speak to the geneal manager, and she kept saying she was in a meeting. I told Jenny how this has compromised my account,and I need reinbursement. She hung up on me!! I will NEVER stay there again!! I advise everyone to check your account twice! They will jip you!!Dear Guest,Thank you for staying with us at the Hampton Inn Atlanta Perimiter Center. I am sorry that you felt that Jenny our guest service agent was rude to you. I personally looked at your account and you were charged the correct amount for your room. As per your request after speaking with you I called your bank and had them remove an aurthorization amount off of your account that your banking institution was holding. I am sorry that this was an issue while a guest at our hotel. We hope that this clears up any misunderstanding and hope that you will choose to stay with us again.
0	Hotel OK but they cannot get a taxi to the hotel. I stayed at this hotel for 3 days. I needed a taxi twice and both times I gave the front desk staff ample notice about needing a taxi but they could not get a taxi to arrive on time or arrive at all. In one instance when the taxi did not show up I almost missed a ferry on which I was scheduled and I would have had to wait a day for the next ferry.One of the hotel managers said they had 'problems' getting taxi's to come to the hotel. Unfortunately, the hotel did not share that with me until it was too late. Otherwise I would have handled my transportation needs myself and not rely on the hotel.My suggestion is not to rely on the hotel for transportation, make your own arrangements.Hello James D.! Please accept my apology for the spotty taxi service. We do, at times, struggle to get cabs to our hotel during peak times. We should have done a better job in communicating with you and offered other options. I really do appreciate your feedback and hope to see you again.
0	Below Expectations. We usually try to stay at the Choice brand of hotels during their rewards point promotions and the discount that I get through an organization that we belong to. We have recently been staying at Quality Inns. Most of the properties seem to have been upgraded. Unfortunately, that was not the case with this one. It was probably nice 40... More
0	Terrible. Just a few of the examples of how terrible: fire alarm went off and hotel needed to be evacuated. When asked what the problem was, the staff said someone turned up the thermostat in the hallway to 90-degrees (serious!! this set off the fire alarm). Workout room had a TV that wasnt working, no towels available - in fact the container that was suppose to hold clean towels and deposit used towels was being used as a trash can! There were also nothing to wipe down the exercise equipment when you were done (gross). We are disheartened to read your review. Please accept our sincere apology for the problems you encountered. You deserved a comfortable and stress-free stay, and we did not live up to your expectations. We will personally address these issues with the appropriate teams to ensure happy guests is our number one priority. We truly regret the inconvenience caused and please consider us again so that we can restore your faith in our hotel and provide you with the hospitality you should always expect from us.Sincerely,Hotel Management
0	Good location shame about rooms. Stayed in December . Location is good close to french quarter and aquarium etc. Front desk staff friendly . Room was not good the bathroom was old and poorly maintained, water pressure very bad and shower not that hot, power points came away from the wall when removing dryer etc. The floor above us was very noisy and we could hear footsteps all night , very loud. Room included croissants for breakfast that we're okay but coffee was only warm . Our room also had a safe that didn't work which is a huge pain. We had to drop valuables at the front desk ever time we went out... The phone in our room also continuously flashed a red message light which is actually quite bright at night... We were told it was faulty ( like the safe) . We would think there are better hotels available. We went to bourbon st on Christmas night and found it to be fine .... Pretty quiet but we left by 9 , so can't comment on excessive drinkers etc. it was quiet for obvious reasons. Also went to the aquarium which was worth the visit.Dear Mooseygoosey,Thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey regarding your recent stay at St. James Hotel, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member.Allow me to apologize on behalf of our hotel for failing to meet your expectations regarding the maintenance of your room on your recent visit. I have shared your feedback with our Chief Engineer to ensure we handle that these problems are taken care of swiftly. Again, thank you for your time and valuable feedback. We sincerely appreciate it and hope you will give us another chance to provide you with superior service and accommodations on your next visit to New Orleans.Kind Regards
0	AVOID THIS HOTEL. Air conditioner didnt work. Toilet was filthy (urine). Service elevator overheated and set off fire alarm. Was repeatedly warned by staff about it being a high crime neighborhood.
1	What a beautiful property in a super cool neighbourhood. I had no expectations in coming to San Diego. I had visited the city 17 years prior and remembered it being beautiful, but I never made it to Old Town. My one goal for the couple of days we had there was to enjoy some Mexican Food. Well, did we come to the right place or what. The Best Western is situated on the side of the hill with a view of the city and the Pacific. It is like a maze and due to low season there were not a lot of people on the property. It felt like we had the place to ourselves. There is a heated pool and a hot tub which are lovely especially at night. We had two amazing experiences regarding the restaurant Acapulco when we were there. Our first night we arrived after a long day of traveling and we were exhausted and starving. It said in our room book that the restaurant closed at 10pm. I looked at the clock and it was 10:01. I called to ask if there was any chance of getting food. They brought us a HUGE platter of amazing Mexican food and a 6-pack and the total was only 70!!! I was so happy. The next morning for breakfast we went to Acapulco again and were greeted by the very friendly staff. The table next to us had a coupon which they couldn't use for some reason so after they left the waitress applied the coupon to our bill without our knowledge and saved us over 20.00 We were blown away. The room was huge and fit our group of 5 comfortably. The lobby was beautifully decorated for Christmas and they even gave my daughter a lovely Christmas gift from under the tree. It is a one minute walk to the main drag in old town and two minutes to a lovely park up the hill. Also the hotel is very close to the transit system and the State park (which is really cool).Thank you for brining attention to the warm responsive service you received while staying with us. Indeed, Old Town boasts some of the best Mexican fare in all of San Diego. Acapulco is a great choice for any meal we are grateful to have them right on our property. Overall, I am happy that we exceeded your expectations and delighted you with our central location!
0	Worst customer service from front desk. I called the Best Value Inn in Auburn, ME to inquire about an event taking place there tomorrow and the front desk person who picked up the phone said to call back after 9am tomorrow, yet the event starts at 8am. When I told him this he was extremely rude and told me that this wasn't his problem. I asked... More
1	Newly renovated & great ammenities!. My Husband and I stayed here last week after returning from a week long cruise out of Charleston. I usually stay at Marriott's or Hilton properties but thought we would try Holiday Inn Express. We were pleasantly surprised! This is a very nice property that has obviously just been renovated. The lobby was beautifully done, as were the rooms and breakfast areas. The staff all seemed eager to help and please. The General Manager seems like she is doing a great job and is hands on as I saw her at the Front Desk on a few occasions talking to staff and interacting with guests. I really appreciated the fact that they had laundry facilitites there to use also, considering we had a lot of dirty laundry from the cruise.The free breakfast was also a bonus as it wasn't your usual boring continental breakfast offerings. They had different items on each of the mornings we were there. Some were: Omelettes, sausage, biscuits, bacon and warm cinnamon buns! The coffee was great (and I am fussy with my coffee!) and they even had a pancake machine.While the location wasn't right downtown we did get a reasonable rate and there was a FREE trolley service right at the side of the hotel. We didn't use the car, instead just jumped on the trolley and were in downtown Charleston in no time!
0	Bad service. after reservation the clerk refused to check my workers because they did not had a credit card at the time and refused to get my info the person that book the hotel for the requirement credit hold.
1	Hotel much better than I though. I first read the reviews of this hotel on this site and mostly all said great things about this hotel and i can see why. When you first get here it does't look or seem like your ordinary hotel from the outside. However, The Hotel hostess were extremely nice, The room was awesome, the bed slept great, room was comfort and cosey, if i decided to cook in the kitchen i could have. Great area, and you can walk to Iwo Jima memorial, or walk to Rosslyn area to eat. I will return with fam friends in spring time.....
1	Bienville House Home away from home. My family and friends come from all across the United States to stay at the Bienville House every August. It is our yearly celebration of my father in-law Paul Helm's Birthday. We are always greeted by familiar faces who welcome us with big hugs. We feel like family when we come back each year. We've worked with management to reserve a room block each year. It has always been a good experience. This beautiful hotel is ideally located in the French Quarter, walking distance from Bourbon St, The flea market and so many of our favorite hot spots. We love to relax by the pool before we head out to another fun filled night in the Quarter. A couple years ago my husband and I renewed our wedding vows by the beautiful pool and then followed by a second line through the French Quarter and reception in the breakfast room. There is just so many wonderful memories made there!We value our patrons at the Bienville House, and are thrilled you have made so many wonderful memories at our hotel. We look forward to seeing you again soon!
1	Aloft is a W Lite. The Aloft brand is essentially a limited service W at a lower price point. They retain many of the stylish elements of a W, but with a more spartan functional design with splashes of color or art. The Lobby features a pool table, WXYZ Bar and small swimming pool. There are comfortable seating areas to work or lounge around and there are board games and even a Happy Hour.The rooms do not have bathtubs, so not recommended for those with young children or those that absolutely need a tub. Another nod to functional design is there are no cabinets with drawers only open shelving. There isn't Room Service or Bell Staff (carts are available), but there is Breakfast, food and snacks available for purchase in the Lobby. The 9 Breakfast Combo is a relative bargain. Self-parking is 20. There are parking lots nearby, ranging from 3.50-5.00, if you are looking to save even more. It is centrally located literally steps from the Olympic Park, Georgia Aquarium, World of Coca-Cola and CNN Center. It is about 15 minutes from the Airport, if there's is light traffic.If you have the proper expectations regarding its limitations, this hotel is lower priced non-traditional option.
1	Great week in Vegas. As an owner of Marriott I couldn't be more pleased with the Grand Chateau. Stayed in a very nice 2 bedroom 2 bath unit plenty of room for the 2 of us. The staff was fantastic. 2 pool areas, one on the 5th floor and the other was on the 387h floor, roof top. Both has full bars and served food.. Location was a half block from the Strip, across the street from Planet Hollywood. Lounge in the lobby and a deli. Would definitely stay there againMichael, we are so happy to hear you are enjoying your Ownership. Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback and leave a perfect review. We look forward to your next visit.
0	Needed a 2-bedroom hotel, so we decided to take a chance. BIG MISTAKE!. Prepaid for four nights, arrived at 4:30 AM the following morning, desk clerk informed us we had to pay an additional 25/day deposit and it would be refunded upon checkout. Not sure what that was about, but he did not offer an explanation. Unit appeared clean, but there was no hairdryer in master bath. Called clerk, stated housekeeping would bring... More
1	Very Nice and Conveniently Located. Just steps away from shopping, restaurants and nightlife, this JW Marriott is a winner. We were here for a meeting and had a very nice room - a little dated, but still very nice. The meeting rooms and technical aspects were fine and the food served to meeting attendees was delicious. The parking deck was hard to access from Lenox Road but that was only a minor detail.Thank you for your visit. Glad you had an opportunity to stay with us for your meeting and found the hotel so very convenient and enjoyed your food service. I'll be certain to share this with our Banquet Chef. So you are aware, our ballroom and 2nd floor meeting space is scheduled for a renovation in July for which we are very excited. Look forward to seeing you soon.
0	You get what you pay for !. The price of the room says it all. It is a cheap hotel room. Clean and OK to stay for a single night when you want a cheap hotel to come in late and stay overnight and get up early and leave. However, the only real big problem with the place is the smell of cigarette smoke that permeates the room!!! It is unbelievable. DO NOT turn on the fan in the bathroom and bring an air freshener. With the LOUD air conditioner on, the room becomes air becomes equalized enough to sleep there. You have been warned !
1	Great location and price. I stayed here recently for a conference. It is centrally located, short walk to Moscone (which is undergoing reconstruction), and very comfortable. I was greeted with a gift bag (usually this is only for weddings) that contained a small bottle of wine, 2 bottles of water, and snacks, which I appreciated. They also provided a 10 credit for the restaurant. The room was small, but there was room for my suitcase, I could hang my clothes in the closet, I could work at the desk, everything was clean, and the room was quiet. What else do you want when staying downtown in San Francisco
1	Maximilian, concierge, was phenomenal!. My stay at the Westin San Diego was an amazing experience. The hotel was beautiful, pristine, very classy. The rooms were also very nice. I would like to give a shout out to the concierge Maximilian, he was so personable and accommodating. His recommendations for restaurants and tips for exploring the city really made our trip to San Diego a great one. Would most definitely recommend the Westin and loved San Diego!Loriemizark - Thank you for your recommendation. 5 star review and for taking the time to personally recognize Maximilian. He does a great job and his knowledge of San Diego is top notch. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Be Well, Alyssa Turowski, General Manager
1	Average Room, Clean, Good for the price. You need a car. This hotel is located in the Hotel circle area of San Diego. Please note being a San Diego resident, this hotel is not close to the downtown / gaslamp area or tourist attractions of San Diego. You are a good 15 / 20 minute cab ride to downtown. Most people stay at these hotels to be near the shopping malls. You will need a car to get around out here, the freeways around hotel circle are all over the place.The room itself is clean and big, but a little dated and the old wooden furniture could use a change, but understand that this hotel is more towards the budget end of hotels in San Diego, so its very decent for the price and surround by other hotels with a La Quinta property right next door.The breakfast is your average one with choices of bread, muffins and some scrambled eggs and sausage, coffee, or make yourself a waffle and some yogurts are available.The bed was pretty comfortable and i felt safe in my room and could not hear any noise from the neighbors. It's also nice you have a lounge area in your room to watch tv and relax and be away from the bedroom. The room also has a fridge and a microwave in them.Overall this is a good location if you need to be in Mission valley.Dear Guest,Thank you very much for leaving our property positive feedback on your recent stay with us. I am very glad to hear you enjoy our suites and all amenties we have to offer. Our central location to all major attractions is a plus but for some it is about 20 minutes out, which i think is still not to bad. Our Hotel recently changed names from Comfort Suites to Quality Suites. In doing so most items in the bed rooms have been replaced with new products from bedding, mattresses and a few others. Between now and March 2015 we should have all renovations complete. We hope to have you visit us again in the near future. Thank you again for the great feedback! Warm Regards,Laura BensonOperations Mananger619-881-4004
0	Friendly but nothing special. This hotel has many good points, most notably its location. Unfortunately, it also has some aspects that didn't live-up to expectation. The parking was free, which in any downtown hotel is a good thing. Sadly, many of the cars are double-parked, which means leaving the key with reception. When we were ready to check-out, we had to wait for ten minutes for the receptionist to find the missing keys to a van that was blocking our exit. The 'free' breakfast wasn't much more than a small table containing coffee, tea bags, hot water and a few pastries (the table sitting in the hotel's lobby which had two chairs). The room was a little scruffy too. The decor was old, the fabrics were very faded and our entrance to the hotel seemed to be held together by the construction that was taking place. If you're looking for a cheap hotel in Downtown SF, this place is ok, just don't expect much.
1	Friendly staff.. Every time I stay here the Front Desk staff is terrific! A young man named Seamus was on duty tonight and he epitomizes the staff at this hotel. He was fast, friendly and efficient. He was also helpful with directions.The rooms are clean and nice. There is a great work area for my computer, and the chair is just right. There's a fridge and a flatscreen TV too.The dining area has a clean updated look, and the food is very good. Its expensive, but the convenience and good taste makes it worthwhile.This is a great hotel if you want to work in, or visit the historic district. Everything is within an easy walk.Dear Trip Advisor Guest,Thank you for your comments and great review. It's truly appreciated. Thanks again and have a Happy New Year. Regards,
0	Good but with a glitch in the service. Got to the hotel in a rainy day and my GPS took me to the backdoor and I call to the operator in order to open up, they said simply not possible because our security employees can get wet!!! I drove extra 10 mins to get in the main entrance and two days later somebody broke in to my rented car, surely the security guy cant get wet and the bad guys of course does!
1	Awesome staff. Cool building and great location. I loved my stay at The Westin for a conference. It was within walking distance of the Gaslamp area and convenient to the water and ferry to Coronado as well as the trolley. The staff was amazing - everyone I encountered went out of their way to be attentive and nice. The bed and linens are super soft. There was a medium sized pool and hot tub. Modern and clean building and I loved the fresh water and fruit in the lobby. Plus, one afternoon there was a happy hour with wine and cheese for free. That was a nice touch!DawnNYC3 I love hearing how you enjoyed all parts of your stay, from our convenient downtown location to friendly staff and the Westin Heavenly bed. We hope you join us again soon!Be Well,Alyssa TurowskiGeneral Manager
0	Nice enough, but missing a crucial element for business travelers. Rooms are clean. Staff is great. The Mix appetizers are quite good. Really nothing negative EXCEPT that their internet speed is capped at 2 Mbps DL and less than 1 Mbps UL, which is inadequate for anyone on business expecting to upload or download anything. There is no high speed option available, even at a premium. This aspect caused me... More
1	Incredible Throwback to a Beautiful Era. The Pearl is an extremely unique place. I do want to counter a few statements from post-reviews about the outdated feel and the ikea like furniture. It's very understandable for someone to not feel that The Pearl is up to date. The architecture of the building is old, yes, and the furniture, yes, but that's the idea behind the movement of this hotel. Seldom these days do you find such a gem that supports and honors the art of MCM. The whole idea is to feel that your living in a 1950-60's dwell magazine ad. Playing episodes of soul train in the courtyard should sell anyone. Good on you folks at The Pearl for keeping the beauty of MCM alive. The Restaurant was incredible, and the support of local and sustainable, is a breathe of fresh air. The staff are charming, funny, and all good looking. Thank you! Thanks for the great review. we appreciate your support. Please come visit us again soon.
1	A great base. We checked in early and it wasn't an issue to the staff. Friendly, efficient check in staff and everyone we met though out the stay was excellent. Rooms will be good for another few years before they need a refurbish. I would only suggest that they take a look at some of the electrical sockets as they made static noise when being used. Also another concern was windows open so if you have children I see a real hazard!!! Everything was clean and as promised on the web site. Love the location and as mentioned, all the staff are 10 out of 10. WILL be back
0	Low Point of our AWESOME Orlando Vacation. Stay somewhere else.. Location, location, location. This is the main reason this hotel stays in business. We had the best vacation in our 8 days in Orlando, and the hotel room was the only thing that did not work out for us. The price was low, and we got what we paid for.We were recommended this hotel by a travel agent based in Orlando, who told us that the Days Inn we were looking at was disgusting. We did not expect the Ritz, but the photos on the hotel website are at least 15 years old and taken from the best possible angles. It is in a great location, it took us 21 minutes to walk to Universal, and it is a beautiful walk with wide sidewalks the whole way.At check in we were assigned room 211. When we entered, the carpets had wet spots, and smelled like urine. The front desk immediately gave us a key for a room on the third floor. This room did not smell, and we did stay in it. It was not clean enough for our standards, so we purchased cleaner and paper towels and spent an hour cleaning the bathroom and vanity ourselves. Toilet ran- had to giggle the handle every time to stop water flow. Shower was moldy, pipes were loud, and pressure/temperature would vary greatly during your shower.The bed sheets are too small for the bed, and completely threadbare. At least they seemed clean. The bath towels were rough and the size of large hand towels. We had 5 people in the room, but most days got only 3 towels and had to ask for more at the front desk. Rugs were nasty- we kept on our shoes in the room. Only one door key was assigned, and the plastic key would get stuck in the lock every time.On the positive side, the kids loved the pool, and it was cleaned daily. The pool area is a bit old, and the chairs are cheap, but the pool bar is adequate and serves decent food. You can use your laptop near the pool. Pool towels are available at the front desk if you ask for them- but they do not let anyone know this, and most of the other families were using their bath towels.Breakfast was spartan, none of the fruit or muffins they show on the website. Bread for toast, milk, OJ, and frosted flakes were the only options for the kids. Coffee was TERRIBLE. There is an IHOP within a block and about 20 breakfast buffets within 1 mile- use them if you want a good breakfast.From this location you can walk to so many restaurants, and can catch a bus to anywhere in Orlando. Try eating O'Charleys on Turkey Lake Road (1 mile away). They had great food and prices. Lots of great spots for ice cream nearby.Our family is planning to return to Orlando in 2011 and have found much, much nicer properties for only a slightly higher cost. Look at the trip advisor ratings and try to find a higher rated hotel. It's worth the extra cost, especially with the low rates that hotels charge in Orlando.Good luck, and enjoy your time in this spectacular city!
1	Good Hotel. We stayed here 2 nights in november of 2012. The hotell is close to the city centre. Very nice people at the check in. Breakfast was really good, you can make your own fresh waffle's. We enjoyed those 2 nights here.Thank you for your review from 2012. We currently offer the fresh waffle makers and we now have access across the street to take the streetcar to all of the other parts of the city outside the French Quarter including the beautiful Garden District and City Park. We look forward to having you stay with us again in the near future.
1	Great Service. Facilities and best hotel fitness center. Stayed here for one night on business. Check in was quick and easy. At first glance, the atrium was impressive. plenty of room to relax, do work, grab a drink or just relax. My room was on the 10th floor and was spacious and had nice views of north atlanta. i met my coworker in the hotel bar/lounge for some appetizers and cocktails. we were so full from the appetizers! The pizza was soooo good and drinks were made to perfection. Later in the evening, i decided to check out the workout facilities. I spent about an hour or so on treadmill. The workout facilities were great, air conditioned and spacious with seperate cardio and free weights room which also led out to a nice indoor pool/whirlpool. Really convenient that the fitness center ins 24 hrs. Then i discovered another perk of the hotel....the womens locker room - seriously looked like a spa and smelled like one..it was so relaxing after a nice workout. In the morning we were flying out, so it was super convenient to have be able to print out my boarding ticket in the lobby. Great stay at the Renaissance Waverly.
0	Mgmt Needs Class in Hospitality. The property is hardly a jewel in the crown if Choice properties. They've tried to update although their decor is still 80's DARK. Brown carpet, et al create a dated atmosphere. They should've spent the extra and replaced the extremely TIRED bathtubs. My complaint w/this property is the poor manor in which I was handled by the manager, Ms.... More
1	Absolutely thrilled. My husband was having surgery and we wanted to stay on the beach while he recovered. Since he needed to stay in the room all day and night, the right hotel was crucial. We picked this hotel based on the reviews and we couldn't have been happier!!! We were there in October, had a room in the front with a balcony on the second floor to view the boardwalk and ocean. The hotel's location is convenient to pretty much everything - whether a major grocery store chain one block behind it, or all the restaurants, and amenities of staying on the beach right at your fingertips. The room was clean and comfortable. We were extremely happy with the price, especially after shopping around first. But best of all, the staff was exceptional! Very personal and caring. Felt as if we had been staying there for years. We expect to be back in San Diego a few more times. This hotel would be our choice of where to stay - and don't feel the need to check out any other place.We are thrilled to know we provided the perfect recovery hotel for your husband! You're absolutely correct - once you've parked the car, everything you could ever need is within walking distance. Customer service is extremely important to us, so we are all elated to know we could make your trip that much more enjoyable. For your next stay, make sure you're signed up for our monthly newsletter to receive special returning guest discounts! Thank you for the review, we look forward to seeing you again.
0	Worst Place to Stay. 4/12 I had the chance to stay at this place overnight while my apartment was getting it's annual pest treatment...so as I sat there I thought I would write everything down that I saw around me... This alone, should discourage you from stoping here.... Dirty Walls Broken and half gone smoke detector Roaches Big and Small (alive and crawling as... More
0	horrible room. you could tell the room hadn't been updated since the 80's and besides only smelling smoke in the non smoking room the beds were 1 foot and 10 inches apart from each other. I actually measured it and that atrocious thing you called breakfast dear lord it was horrible oh and there was hair all over the bathroom like someone... More
0	INFESTED with bugs!. The hotel is nice, the location is good, and the staff has been nice BUT it is infested with little cockroaches and they are every where! It is disgusting! I would recommend spending a little more money for a hotel that won't have you sleeping and going home with nasty bugs! Thank for your recent review. We are happy to you thought the hotel and hotel staff were nice. We appreciate that you have brought this area of concern to our attention. Rest assured, each guestroom is routinely deep cleaned and treated with commercial grade steamers as a preventative measure. Our professional pest control team has in place preventative measures and has onsite visits regularly. Again, thank you for taking the time.
1	Awesome stay!. This is long overdue. However, my family and I had a wonderful trip from cape cod to this hotel. We drove here, we stayed over Christmas, which we have never not been home before. My family surprised us and showed up too and the front desk helped arrange for them to be right near us! The staff here were friendly, accommodating and the rooms were very clean! This property is a suites property and worked out very well for our family. Hotel was close to restaurants and a short drive to Disney and all the amusements parks which were very fun!
1	Enjoyable stay!. The hotel is in a great location for shopping around Union square and in walking distance to several areas of interest including China Town and the MOMA. It is very close to all modes of public transit (cable cars, street cars, buses and BART stations) and to many restaurants many of which were affordable and varied. Our room was quiet and clean and our bed was very comfortable with abundant pillows. We also felt the service was very good and friendly particularly the help desk to assist with any questions on getting around or restaurant suggestions. We were able to buy stamps to send some postcards, which the hotel took care of mailing. There is also some readily available lime and lemon water at the front entrance that we enjoyed when coming back from a long day of visiting.We managed to get a pretty good deal using Otel.com (about 157/night) for an otherwise pretty pricy 4 star hotel. We could have upgraded our room to a King bed for an extra 10/night which we did not opt for. I was expecting a bit more from a 4 star (although a first time for us), but do not have much negative aspects to point out as we had a very enjoyable stay. I would caution not to venture too far beyond Mason street (towards Terderloin) into sketchier areas with many beggers. The streets around the hotel and Union Square were fine to walk on even at night.It is true that it cost 20 to use the pool for the duration of your stay and about 7.5/15 mins to use the internet. However, we did not use these services. We did use some pay phones in the Business Center which allowed to make long-distance calls to Canada for 1-2 dollars for about 2 mins., which suited us just fine. We also did not try the Anzu restaurant which seemed delightful, although maybe a bit pricy. The Razz room seemed quite popular, but we did not catch any of the shows since none were of interest to us. We did see that same-day half-price tickets were available close by at Union Square most for the Razz room performances. The concierge service was very practical to allow us to leave our luggage and enjoy one more afternoon in the city before a late flight back home.

1	Friendly/Courteous Staff. The staff were friendly and courteous, the head of house keeping does a great job in making sure the customers are taken care of. The management should think about getting their house keeping department better cleaning solutions for the bathroom tiles are starting to mildew up and there was some black mold starting to form around the top soap dish in the bathroom tubDear Rocky D,Thank you so much for all of your feedback. All your concerns are important to us! I will definitely share this information with my entire staff. The Wingate by Wyndham hotel is looking forward for to your next visit to Atlanta please feel free to contact us for any request!Tremeil B.Assistant Manager
1	Great location and ambiance. I try to stay at Rex Hotel whenever I am in San Francisco for business, which is every few months. The hotel definitely has character. The location is hard to beat as well. Since San Francisco is not densely populated, I recommend staying in Union Square area since it is always lively even late in the evening. On the other hand hotels towards Tenderloin area would not be a good choice if you like to take a walk around. Rex Hotel is on Sutter Street which is close enough to Union Square but far enough from Tenderloin.I like to order breakfast in my room. It also serves as a wake up call. Wireless internet in the room works decent enough. Did not slow down during the evening where many people connect to it.I only stayed as single person in their room. For a couple maybe ask for a large room as their rooms are not very big.
0	Very noisy AC. And watch out for the wet floor when you checkin!!!. I stayed in Hilton Inn in other cities before this Orlando visit. Very disappointed specially the sleep quality with the noisy Window style AC unit. And being a gold member. I was not offering the free water when checking in!! Sigh... disappointed
1	Better Than I Expected. My stay was better than expected. It was unusual that check-in is on the top floor, but it didnt bother me (although the wait for the elevator can be a bit slow). I agree with one reviewer who commented that the hotel was a little confused on their design. The top floor (as pictured on their website) has a very nice contemporary feel a really good first impression. However, when I arrived on the 14th floor where my room was located, it felt like Gumbys grandma was hired to design it. Whoever chose this designer must have owed someone a HUGE favor because I have never seen lime green in that quantity. I would not have mentioned the dcor if I was at some cheap hotel in Vegas but I think it was strangely (and noticeably) out of place here. Despite that, the room met expectation, given the location. For the most part, it was clean and the bed was comfortable. If you look a little closer, you can definitely spot some noticeable wear and tear, but nothing that really bothered me. There were some perks that made the stay more comfortable a loofah scrub for the shower, disposable slippers and complimentary bottled water just to name a few. Outside the room, all the staff I spoke with were all pleasant and helpful. I had dinner (once) and breakfast (twice) at the restaurant XIX and found the food excellent each time. I would definitely eat there again. The location of the hotel is excellent 5-10 minutes walking distance from the Walnut Street entrance: Rittenhouse Square to the left, the Historical District to the right, the Theater District just down Broad street and the Convention Center up the street. I encourage using a taxi instead of renting a car as it looked like parking is a premium (I think I saw a sign at a parking lot that said 3.25 for every 20 minutes). One important thing: If you are a light sleeper and not used to the city sounds I recommend bringing ear plugs. The three days I spent there I could barely sleep a wink because I was constantly woken up by the sounds of sirens below (theres a hospital nearby). On the second night, I was woken up by what I think was street cleaning around 4 or 5 in the morning. It sounded like an alarm clock beeping for what felt like half an hour.I wouldnt mind staying here again if I was on business (i.e. company pays). Its a little pricey for what you get.
0	A noisy stay. Very noisy location as it is right on the highway. Staff was clearly not interested in the guests, internet was patchy and the room smelled of smoke. The breakfast looked good until you tried the hot stuff which was awful. I would not recommend this for business travelers as you will not get any sleep, the highway right next to it was incredibly loud and they allow semis to park in the parking lot which made more incredibly loud noise. This went on all night until early morning.
0	Construction across the street 24/7 NO SLEEP. Hotel is nice. Well it's ok. Staff is nice but the construction is 24/7. It's 3:40am ant the cement trucks (3) are working non stop so you hear the diesel running and the back up beeping non stop. I understand there building condos so fault on the hotel but no sleep. Call before you book make sure the construction is... More
0	Close to seaworld but not the best place to stay.. Very convenient location to seaworld. You can walk there in 10 minutes. However, the front personnel Josef is not familiar with policies. Neither does he know you to provide great customer service. Room was dirty pubic hairs in the bed. The bathroom vanity also had a long dark hair on it. I was not offered another room for any type of solution. I also was not given a credit included in our rate. Staff had no clue about the credit. Management was not available at anytime during our stay. I would prefer a clean room to the proximity to seaworld. Do yourself a favor stay somewhere else.
1	Wonderful Stay, Great Location. I'd always stayed in downtown when I visited Seattle, but decided to try something different this time, which led me to The Sorrento. I couldn't be happier about my choice. The First Hill location is quiet, mostly residential plus a couple hospitals. It's sort of between Capitol Hill and downtown, which are my favorite neighborhoods and within walking distance. Immediately near the hotel, there are Starbucks, Top Pot Donuts, McDonald, Walgreens (I think) and Bank of America - all that convenience! The hotel itself is full of old world charm w/o feeling stuffy or dated. Its restaurant Dunbar Room was excellent - the ambience and hospitality actually reminded me of New Orleans. I stayed at the junior suite - it's big and has a lot of nice details from a design standpoint. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful, which made my stay even more wonderful. My only frustration was weak, spotty WiFi - it could just be that particular weekend but I'd keep in mind if you travel for business and WiFi is crucial.Any comparison to the Big Easy I'll take! I am happy to read your comments about the staff, I agree, they are wonderful. We're working to improve our Wi-Fi for the future. Thank you for the kind words regarding your experience at Hotel Sorrento. We look forward to welcoming you back soon!Angie M. MykelGeneral ManagerHotel Sorrento
1	Close to Balboa Park, Old Town, and Downtown. This hotel is located such that it's fairly easy to get to most parts of San Diego. The hotel is a little older, but it is kept up well. Food at the diner is a little on the expensive side (NO CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST!!), but the staff are friendly. The room we were in was clean and wasn't too noisy.Thank you for the nice review and for being our guest. We are happy to hear you enjoyed our convenient location located close to all the attractions in San Diego. Hopefully well welcome eyou back real soon. Thank you!
0	It didn't feel clean. The first room we got instantly smelled like smoke so we told the front desk and they got us a new room - which was very nice of them. Our second room smelled like an old frat house. I slept in a hooded sweatshirt because I didn't feel comfortable in the bed. We didn't use any blankets because they smelled... More
1	treat you well, great service. Stayed in January for 5 nights. Close enough to the Moscone center (5 minute walk) Staff were very nice and remembered our names, (somewhat) Very nice rooms and comfortable beds. They would clean your room after you left and turn down the beds right before you got back. Unfortunately sometimes the timing was a little off and they walked in while I was changing once and came in while we were there a few other times. It didnt bother me a whole lot but just be aware that if you don't want them to come in then put out the 'do not disturb' sign. Mandatory valet parking and sometimes we were waiting for that service. overpriced hotel bar, you might almost laugh at the prices unless you are made of money (I am not) but then again with how much it costs to stay there a night you probably wouldn't even wink. my view was of a construction sight but I wasn't in the room much so no matter. Never went to the restaurant. there is a pool on the 5th or something like that floor but we didn't swim. Would definitely reccomend if you are rich. If you aren't then dont go broke for the amazing service they offer.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your review of The St. Regis San Francisco. I ma delighted to hear that you had a pleasant stay and appreciate your kind words about our staff and service. Please do not hesitate to contact me directly prior to your next visit as we hope to welcome you back soon.Sincerely,Anthony DugganHotel Manager415-284-4057Anthony.dugganstregis.com
1	Close to everything. I admit this is an older hotel, but it has a lot of charming appeal, and most of all, it is so close to everything. The hotel is about three blocks from Bourbon Street, which I really didn't like going. Four blocks from Cafe de Monde and five blocks from the French Market. I did not rent a car, I used public transportation during my four-day-stay in New Orleans. When I got to the hotel at about 1:30pm, my room was ready. I rented a king size bed. The room is pretty spacious, with a big window looking over Landry's seafood restaurant. I did not have breakfast at the hotel since there are a lot of places to try out new food. I did partake on the afternoon cookies and lemonade, which they put out around 2pm. I will stay here again without a doubt. I loved my stay at the Bienville House hotel.We are so glad you enjoyed your stay at the Bienville House and took the time to share your great experience with TripAdvisor. It sounds like the perfect trip! Please return soon to the Bienville House for another great trip!
1	Great place to stay in NOLA. I've stayed at a lot of hotels but this was one of the best. Very friendly staff and extremely helpful. It is located on the edge of the French Quarter but the streetcar stops just outside the front of the hotel so you can get to a lot of places. They have parking, for a charge, and we ere able to leave our car when we checked out until the afternoon. Very helpful. The pace is not new but is well cared for and build around a garden so it have a real NOLA feel to it. I'm glad we stayed there.Thank you Larry for taking the time to review our hotel. We appreciate all the kind words and are pleased to know you had a great stay. We look forward to having you the next time you visit New Orleans.
0	Worst Hotel Stay Of My Life!!!!. My husband booked our hotel stay here through Priceline.com. I called a week before our travel date to request a King Non-Smoking Room. The front desk receptionist informed me that the room was already booked for a King Non-Smoking. I informed them that I had spoken with someone earlier and was promised the King room. She wanted to know with whom I spoke. I did not take the young ladies name. Where I come from when someone tells you they will do something they are suppose to do it! They had given away our room and we had to settle for Queen Non-Smoking. They had no explanation or common courtesy to offer for their mistake. This hotel was absolutely Filthy. It smelled terrible. Every corridor reeked of air freshener trying to cover up the unpleasant odors. They do not maintain anything. The lobby, corridor, and elevator was so bad that I actually dreaded going into the room. Every inch of floor was covered with something that needed swept, mopped, or vacuumed. The room ceiling had huge water stains, curtains had some huge black mystery stain on them. The carpet was sticky. The bathroom floor was slippery with God only knows what. The room did not smell fresh at all. The fabric furniture had huge stains all over it. It was so bad I was afraid to put my clothes or belongings anywhere. I ended up removing the comforter and laying it over the sofa so we could put our things down. I did not remove my socks in the room my entire stay. The bed was extremely uncomfortable. The bedding was old, tabby, and scratchy. The pillows were like rough paper. The kitchen was dirty the sink had gunk in the bottom. Floors were not swept well. The A/C unit was so loud it was like a piece of machinery was in the room with us. The person above us stomped their floor all night. You can hear everything through the walls inside. You can also hear everything from the outside of the hotel as well. Very old building that needs an absolute demolition and remodel inside. I have stayed in many hotels in my time, but this one was absolutely disgusting. Then the next morning when we were ready to get the heck outta there the front lobby attendant informed my husband that he needed to pay more for the room. She refused to check us out until my husband paid her. She claimed we had been put in the wrong room. Yes thanks to them we had! Because they gave away our room! We had already paid for our room through priceline. The transaction was complete. She wanted my husband to give her a receipt from the previous afternoon when we checked in. They didn't give us anything at that time. She wanted to know who checked us in so she could scold them. Guess what SHE DID! She would not look at the booking in her system and flat out accused my husband of lying about the fact that he paid through priceline. She told him she couldn't take his word for it. Okay fine, then look into your own computer system the information is there! He had to call me inside from our car and I literally had to pull up the priceline information that she refused to look for herself on her computer from my phone. She was trying to charge us 99.00 dollars inclusive of tax for a room we had already paid for. She still argued with my husband and refused to speak to him directly. She kept yelling the same thing asking who checked us in. Again SHE DID! She was the rudest front desk attendant I have ever dealt with. Finally after she was satisfied with the receipt on my phone, she still held us there so she could call their own help line to fix the problem. She finally let us go and never gave us our receipt from them. I will NEVER stay at this hotel again. I don't suggest you do either.
1	great service. I would like to comment how pleased I was with BEST WESTERN Mission Bay at San Diego, CA. My family scheduled a trip to San Diego on Dec 2014 and we stayed there from Dec 9 to Dec 13 at room 231. During the time, we visited Sea world, Legoland, midway aircraft carrier museum, etc. Every night, we had a good sleep when we back exhausted from a whole day's trip.On the last day, In haste to catch our flight at LA, I left my wallet in room 231. The time I noticed it missing we were already back to my home in Canada. I called the hotel. The gentleman who pick up the phone was very kind and he asked me to leave my contact information. I am so happy the next day, because my wife told me that she got called from a Lady from your hotel that my wallet was found. And with your help mailing it to my home in Canada, I finally got all my card back (Driver license, debit cards, credit cards, insurance card, etc). I want to express my deep appreciation for all the services from BEST WESTERN Mission Bay, which leave us a very good memory for this family trip. Besides, breakfast is awesome, kids love it.Good Morning,Thank you so much for taking the time to share your experience here at the Best Western Mission Bay.

1	Good Location. In the heart of the theatre district this is one of the oldest hotels in Chicago. and is ideally placed to tour downtown.if you arrive at O'Hare International Airport there's no need to pay a high taxi fare (unless perhaps you are loaded with bags!) Use the CTA train from Terminal 2 which, for 5 dollars takes you to Clarke and Lake where the hotel is situated just down the street, a 3 minute walk. This worked well for us.The hotel is clean and rooms comfortable but is showing signs of age in some of the dcor but perhaps this adds to its old world charm. Staff were pleasant and helpful and complimentary coffee in the lobby was a nice touch.There is no restaurant at this hotel but there is an arrangement with the restaurant next door. We were catching a night train so didn't get to try the breakfast.The bed was comfortable and was welcome after a long flight.Complimentary dressing gowns in the bathroom offered that little extra luxury.The mini bar was extensively stocked but like all hotels, expensive!I'd certainy recommend this hotel as a base for exploring as anywhere downtown is within easy walking distance and local transport for further afield is easy.Good Afternoon,A charming art deco vibe is what we aim for! Thanks for staying with us. We work hard to make our guests happy and appreciate your feedback!

The room was very spacious, good views and the staff very helpfull.Would stay there again!Claire d,I am delighted to hear you enjoyed your stay at the Westin San Diego.

1	comfortable oasis in my room. Comfortable room, good bedding luxurious towels. All appliances worked ran quietly. Only 1 of 2 ice machines working, but always had ice when I needed it. Continental breakfast entrees were good changed often. Pleasant, helpful, courteous staff. Easy checkin checkout. VERY SMALL hotel POOL, so couldn't get in my exercise. Close to major highway fast foods, grocery drug stores. GOOD PRICE for the location. Would recommend to families, solos, seniors.Good Afternoon,Thank you for taking time to write a Tripadvisor review about your recent stay here at the Best Western Mission Bay.

1	2015 Jan Orlando Stay. I highly recommend this hotel. I found the staff helpful and caring...even in the flurry of morning rush, they noticed that I was not feeling well and asked if there was anything they could do. In the 'by the book numbers' process of today, this act of kindness was very touching. They all went out of the way to correct every little thing.I thank you for appreciating my staffs caring and helpful deeds in your review. I am glad they went above and beyond to help you out with your issue. I was also happy to know that they left a good impression on you which resulted in you recognizing their service and sharing it with our online viewers. I am sure they will be very delighted once they read your review. We are grateful to you for recommending us to our online viewers. Thank you for choosing us and we would love to have another opportunity of welcoming you back to our hotel again.Sincerely,Alex BlancoGeneral Manager
1	Perfect Location. There were four couples of us meeting from several states to spend a few days in New Orleans...mainly to visit the WWII museum. We got a good rate on Hotel.com at the Bienville and decided to stay there. One thing that surprised us, was that they have quite a few rooms with no windows...and we all got one of these rooms. Other than that, everything at the hotel was good. The staff are all very pleasant and helpful...especially the husband and wife team that help with breakfast. (One warning here...there is not nearly enough seating to accommodate the number of rooms the hotel has if you get there any time after 8am.) The rooms are comfortable and very nicely furnished. The hotel itself is clean and beautifully decorated. The hotel is within walking distance of most everything...right off of the French Quarter. And...it is only a couple of blocks away from the bus or trolly stop if you are going further. The WWII museum is a little over a mile away (plan on spending the whole day there...it is amazing!!!). You can either walk or take the bus/trolly. One warning...parking is VERY expensive. With tax, it was 38 per day for our SUV.Overall...I would definitely stay there again!Hi BarDen, Thank you so much for the wonderful review! We glad you enjoyed your stay and hope to see you again soon.

When I asked to host if our room was no animals, he sighed and said sir, this hotel is so old, I wouldn't be surprised if there have been 10 horses in there.

1	Great Hotel at Fisherman's Wharf. This was our second visit to The San Remo. For us, it's the perfect place to stay in San Francisco. The hotel is just a few minute walk from Pier 39 for shopping and restaurants. It's also only minutes away from any tour you'd like to take, whether you want to catch a boat to Alcatraz or ride a Segway on Lombard St. When you return from a tiring day of sightseeing, there are refreshments in the lobby! Coffee, tea and ice water along with an assortment of sweets are complimentary, as are the massage chairs on each floor. Downstairs is the oldest Italian restaurant in the U.S. The Fior d'talia is a delicious place for dinner and has a great jazz band on Wednesday nights. The staff at the San Remo are friendly and helpful and always smiling. Don't let the fact that the washrooms are down the hall dissuade you from staying here, they are spotlessly clean and we never had to wait for a shower. The towels are even warmed for you!
1	Best hotel I have stayed in. This is one of the best hotels I have stayed in, and I have stayed in many hotels around the world. We had two rooms (5 people). The rooms are spacious and beds very comfortable. Very clean and fresh, with everything in place. There is also a quiet garden with a pool + sun chairs and a nice, green lounge feeling. In the lobby there is a coffee shop and a shop that sells travel items. Excellent wifi, not too much noise and a short walk to TGIF and Dennys for food. We had breakfast for 13.95 per person, and that was a pretty good deal. Could have had some more healthy food, but overall it was good. Free shuttle to the airport every 30 min. Recommend it!We are honored to receive such praise from a seasoned traveler such as yourself and appreciate that you took the time to list some of our many amenities! We thank you for your recommendation and encourage you to socialize with us on Facebook and Twitter so you may receive advance information on deals with us.
0	Not so Grand. Lost reservation, incompetence by staff,, overcharge credit cards.....that was my experience at the Grand Hyatt.After a long day of travelling to reach hotel and to be told issues with reservation, Front desk staff are either incompetent or lack required training for position. hotel sold out for the weekend. Asked to speak with someone with authority, asst. manager now involved. All I can say.... thank goodness reservation was booked thru an executive / director with the Hyatt chain.... Or we would of been screwed royally.Checkout was a disaster. Credit cards presented and staff unable to handle splitting the charges to two credit cards. Not only do they charge full amount to both cards, but do it twice. Trying to correct was a nightmare. Once back in Canada, numerous calls and numerous employees in Accounting involved. With the exchange on the CDN dollar, I'm still out of pocket for their error.Plus side, never again. Avoid this property. Other great properties in the vicinity that I'm sure offer better service!!!!!!To management, suggest additional training required for your front desk and accounting staff. Appears they have no clue in the process for checking in, customer service, or processing credit card payments and credits.
1	Wonderful Stay in the City, with minor suggestions. The Orchard Garden is terrific hotel in a fantastic location. Walking distance to the top of Nob Hill, while also an easy walk to the Ferry Building. Nice people, excellent service. Very comfortable beds and quiet, spacious room. Reasonable price under 200 over the weekend, too. I didn't visit the restaurant, nor use the fitness equipment. Spent time in the city instead. I would only recommend one thing: the rooftop terrace could benefit from some improvement. In my opinion, if you do a rooftop space, it should make guests feel comfortable and be an oasis within the city. See Hotel Vitale in SF or Hotel Giraffe in NY. Great rooftops. When we visited the Orchard Garden's rooftop at night, the lighting didn't work. It also didn't have much landscaping and wasn't very inviting overall. It didn't even really fit with the the atmosphere for the rest of the hotel. But, I really like this hotel overall and it will get my first call for my next visit. Everything else was great and price and location are hard to beat.
0	Nothing special but a fancy lobby and a high price tag. Good for Moscone Conference only.. I booked an upgraded room and the room was just average, nothing fancy for the price. The area is good if you are attending a conference at the Moscone center. You will have to walk about 1/4 - 1/2 a mile towards downtown for some decent food. Black cars and taxis are available upfront. For cheaper alternative, there is a... More
1	W Seattle + Seahawks Win Perfect Anniversary Stay. As seasons ticket holders for the Seattle Seahawks, we typically drive down from Vancouver then drive back up after the game. This time, we decided to make a night of it and stay at The W Seattle. Received a pre-stay message from W Insider, Mykaela, with great dining recommendations near the hotel. As it was our first night away from our baby boy, I replied back to Mykaela to see if she could set up a special surprise for my girlfriend. She replied back and was excited to help out with my little request. When we arrived, we were welcomed by Rachel, who was inviting and funny, and got us into our room. When we entered the corner room with a west view, right on the desk was a amenity and card from Mykaela, wishing us a happy anniversary, along with the little surprise for my girlfriend a stylishly framed picture of her and our baby boy so that she wouldn't miss him too much. After checking in and refreshing from the drive, a short walk took us to Century Link Field, just in time for kickoff. After a win for the Seahawks over the Eagles, we walked around the city, popped into a little Mexican joint for dinner, then back up to the room to enjoy the city view and Stellina Di Notte amenity.The next morning on our way out, as we were waiting for the elevator, the room attendant on the 17th floor greeted us from another room and thanked us for staying. Nice acknowledgement.At check out, Mykaela was at the desk and got the chance to thank her in person for the personalized service. Stored our bags for the morning to grab brunch, before heading back up to Vancouver. Short but really sweet stay. Thanks W Seattle...and Go Seahawks.WOW, what a fabulous review, and I am thrilled that we were able to make it special for you both! And we agree, Mykaela IS amazing, and we are thrilled to have her on our team! We appreciate you staying at W Seattle, and we hope to see you back next time you are in the city! Thanks again and GO HAWKS!
1	Wonderful stay.. We stayed one night at this hotel - it was the first visit at a Hilton which I enjoyed a lot. The rooms were spotless and the outdoor pool at the patio was very enjoyable.We were 7 of us, arriving quite early and they were able to accommodate us almost immediately and have the two rooms done up quickly . THe staff was very friendly and courteous. We will definitely stay there again.Thanks so much for your terrific review. I am so glad our team made you feel welcome and that your suite had everything you needed to make you feel at home. We all are about impressing the guest and it appears we did just that in your case. Thanks again for your nice comments. I will be sure to share your nice comments with our associates. We hope you will come back and see us again. Sincerely,Alex BlancoGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando International Airport
0	Worst Business Hotel I've Stayed At. Let me start off by saying I am a marriott Gold Status member who logged 50+ nights at Marriotts last year and year-to-date has logged 41 nights with Marriott. I'm always on the lookout for reasonably priced business hotels. Let's just say that this isn't one of them. Several Cons about the hotel and rooms:- There are no irons in the rooms, you have to go to a communal ironing room. This makes it weird when you have to get dressed in the morning to go iron your clothes. For the road warrior who likes to iron in the AM after they get out of the shower, it makes it awkward.. - The showers are literally in the bedroom with no defined bathroom area. When you get out of the shower onto the wood floors, you get water all over the floors next to your bed area. - The rooms are the sizes of coffins. - There is absolutely no storage in the rooms for clothes (no closet, no real hanger system to hang work shirts or coats, no drawers. You have no option other than to live out of a suitcase, which is even a problem because there is no real benching area or room to put your suitcase. The goal of this hotel is to create an experience for the guest. They want the guest to be driven out of the room to the common area lobbies to spend time with other guests and to spend money in the lobby. Unfortunately for those of us who need to do work or are looking for some relaxing quiet time, this hotel doesn't allow you to accomplish that. When you are in the lobby, they are blaring club music and at night times, they have a DJ who also blares club music. It's just a lot of crummy club music. The other issue I had was the excessive promotion of alcohol consumption. It was no stop. Although I enjoy alcohol, I could see how someone who didn't or who is in recovery from alcohol could feel weird when staying here. For someone who has stayed at Marriotts roughly 50 times per year for business and for pleasure, i would never recommend someone going to this hotel. It's a terrible hotel with minimal space and an overarching desire to try to be overly cool. I can't stress how much i actually hated staying at this hotel. It was terrible.Hello 575bjacobs,We are so sorry to hear about the poor experience you had at the Moxy Chicago. Our goal is for our guests to be comfortable and enjoy all of our unique amenities and we hate that we let you down. We value every bit of feedback - good, bad, and in-between. We do now offer irons, upon request, in our guest rooms, along with additional hangers and storage containers that slide directly under the bed in order to help better cater to the needs of our beloved business travelers. We hate to see you leave, but realize the Moxy experience may not be for everyone or those expecting the traditional hotel stay. While we know this does not help your experience, we hope you will accept our apologies. We wish you the safest of travels.Peace. Love. Moxy
0	What A Dump!!! Avoid Like the Plague!!. This is the 3rd time I have been to Florida and the 1st ...and last time I will stay at the Orlando Continental!!My party was 5 adults and the room did have two double beds which was fine, but my 16 yr old son had to sleep on a rollaway camp style bed with his legs hanging off the edge!!The air con, was up the creek and was either too hot or too cold and very very noisy! Every day when we came back to the room after visiting the theme parks the walls were wet, all our clothes were wet and the beds were wet!Our view from the room window was a blank wall and therefore the room was always dark.The free breakfast in the morning was a joke, with a free for all for the toast, fighting for seating and a real cattle market. The pool was very small and you could not swing a cat in the games room (I use the term 'games' loosely) because the room is about 6ft by 4ft!).To be fair the only 'good' point with this hotel is the location. It is right on International Drive and takes about 30 seconds to get to wet n wild so you can walk there and save on parking.I ended up staying one extra night in florida, so I stayed in the Holiday Inn which is also on International Drive, about 500m up the road. What a pleasure! I thought I was in Heaven!!In conclusion, I would say, only stay here if you really really really don't mind the quality of the hotel and want a cheap hotel to rest your head at night.
1	cheap and convenient. Visited D.C. for two days and found this to be gret for what we needed. Close to the metro and shuttle service to and from. Breakfast was ok...not that much variety but for the price adequate. Only issue we had was with the shuttle one evening we got in about two minutes after the scheduled shuttle from metro to hotel and they would not wait for us. I think a small exception could have been made to wait a minute or two at 10 pm to wait for a guest that was on the phone with you telling you that they were one stop away. Front desk just said sorry we cant wait..next shuttle will be in 30 minutes. We took a taxi and although its probably only a quarter of a mile drive it cost ten dollars. I have mixed feelings about how that situation was handled being in customer service but I can also understand that there has to be structure as well. Overall a good place to stay.. I would recommend it to friends.
1	Best location and restaurant (and great wifi!). Me and a friend stayed here on the last leg of our 6 week American adventure for 3 nights. When we arrived the first receptionist was quite short and boderline rude however the manager took over (Gutted I can't remember his name) and he could not have been more helpful. We had a few conversations with him and he was a genuinely lovely man who couldn't have been more helpful.There are no lifts in this hotel, however the aforementioned manager helped us up the many stairs with our luggage. I have never stayed in a shared bathroom hotel before but it was not as bad as I envisioned. They were always immaculate and never too much of a wait as there were 3 toilets on our floor.I would say if you are a younger traveller this may not be the hotel for you as we did get told off for laughing too loudly with some travellers from neighbouring rooms, however this was completely justified, just if you're after a more lively scene, pick a hotel with sound proofed rooms! There are no TV's in the room's and they are quite small but if, like us, you are after a relaxed vibe when you get in, this is great. (Another reviewer compared this hotel to 'staying at grandma's' and I couldn't agree more)The location of the hotel was absolutely perfect. In some parts of San Fran I did feel slightly unsafe but could not fault the location of the San Remo at all, a quieter, friendly area. Opposite there is a great little cafe, Caffe Cappiccio (Helpful as the hotel does not provide a breakfast), some bars (our favourite being La Rocas) and a 10 minute walk to Fisherman's Wharf. The restaurant of the hotel was absolutely brilliant. The food was delicious and there was a fantastic band playing while we were eating who also did a great rendition of happy birthday to my friend.All in all, this hotel was a great little find and I would love to see what the penthouse is like!Again, thank you to the manager, your customer service was impeccable.Thank you so much for your comments and feedback. Our staff are well-trained and expected to help our guests above and beyond, just like Kenley (our manager) did. We will look into the front desk staff you mentioned, as we are in the hospitality business and expect the best from our staff.Besides being close to many famous attractions, our neighborhood is very safe. We are very glad that you felt comfortable walking around here. The Fior d'Italia is America's oldest Italian restaurant and our guests get 10 discount. We hope you will choose to stay with us again in your next trip to the US.
0	Not worth the price. I paid over 190. The pictures looked nice but they were deceptive. The outside looks like a Motel 6. The rooms were nice on the inside with modern decor but the staff was extremely rude. I travel a lot, domestically and internationally. This was a very unique experience in the way I was treated upon arrival. I would not recommend this hotel. I should have either stayed at a bargain hotel or went for it and spent the 400 to stay at a nice place downtown.Melissa R - Please let me start by apologizing to you for your disappointing stay. Our practice is to make sure all our guests feel warm welcome. I would very much like to speak with you, so that I may get more details regarding your experience. I can be reached directly at 707-257-1930. ext 150. Thank you, Genafer Vattuone
0	Really sub-par. The room was far below my expectations. I arrived at 1am and was given a handicap room with chipped paint and generally not clean. I expect so much more from the W and so much more the cost. I think I would have had a better experience at the Hyatt or Marriott. Very disappointed Thank you for providing your feedback mandeez, I am sorry that we missed the mark with the room you received during your recent stay with us. We take these things seriously and will review with our staff in order to improve our service and your experience in the future.
1	Incredible Service. It was amazing to visit San Francisco at Hotel Abri in the fall and enjoy the fantastic room, shopping, convention, restaurants and hospitality, for its price its like finding a treasure The hotel is an excellent one and we have experienced a nice time. Every time we entered the hotel, we were greeted with a homely reception. This was our first Abri experience and we were very impressed with the room, hotel and your staff. Indy Shrestha, hotel Manager was incredible and went above and beyond the customer service level. After long days and nights it was truly a joy to come back to the comfort of the room. Definitely, we will be back again.
1	PERFECT location and GREAT hotel!. My family and I just got back from vacationing on the west coast. We stayed at the Columbus for one night, and we couldn't have been happier! The location is IDEAL - better than staying at the Warf and at a much better rate. You can not beat the free parking either. You are a couple blocks from the crookedest street and Fisherman's Warf. You can grab the cable cars right at the corner or walk two blocks towards FW and grab it at the end/begining of the line. The area is perfectly safe and we never felt nervous while walking around in the evening. One thing to note, however, the nightclub next door is now open again (some people here had previously stated it was closed). We had a room on the third floor on the corner right next to the the club and you could hear the music slightly through the walls. I don't think there would be any problem if you got any of the other rooms facing the street and not the corner room or if you were staying during the week instead of over the weekend like us. Though our room was right in front of the elevators, we never heard a peep from any of the others staying in the hotel.The rooms are VERY clean and nicer then I expected! We loved the layout of the room! Though we didn't have a balcony, we had half a wall of windows that opened and a great little table/chairs to sit and watch the day go by. The beds were comfortable, the bathroom a nice size, and the shower had good water pressure.We would certainly stay here again. The staff was very helpful and polite. NOTE: You may be tempted to ask for a room away from the road, but I wouldn't do so. You're stuck (1) with not view facing the building next door and (2) You're stuck right next to the nightclub - certainly not more quiet then the street during the weekend. The traffic noise was minimal and wouldn't bother the average sleeper. Besides, it's not a huge interstate highway passing by the hotel anyway. Just a regular city street.Fisherman's Warf: This is a very touristy location and not the cute little warf you might imagine or remember from days gone by. Certainly take a stroll down to it to at least check out the sealions basking on the platforms, but I wouldn't recommend eating there unless you just want something basic. Instead, China Town and Little Italy is close by and offers a much better selection and quality of food.Cable Car: Purchase a day pass instead of simply a one-way or round trip ticket. The day pass only costs a couple dollars more and it allows you to jump on and off when you want for the whole day.
0	Not safe or clean, but comfortable.. The side door was broken and stuck open-not safe by my standards. There was plastic food storage under my bed skirt. My room was comfortable and a great breakfast started at 4am which helps for early flights.
0	You get what you pay for...... This place needs a complete restoration. Ceilings and walls have patches everywhere. The room smells like mold. The towels are like sandpaper. Bedding is stained and mattresses are sagging. The tub is dripping. There are plenty of cockroaches. I could go into more detail, but then I might throw up.
1	Relaxing weekend. This was a great hotel pick away from the hustle and bustle. It was a short drive to the aquarium which we did not mind. The grounds across the street from this property are breath taking and make for a great photo opt. We did not eat here because the food was pricey. If you stay venture out into the Galleria centre for cheaper food. This is located just past the pool and spa. My only disappointment was that the outdoor pool was closed. It is a beautiful hotel and I would recommend it to friends.Thank you for taking the time to share your experience! I am glad you enjoyed your stay and we hope to have the opportunity to have you back with us in the near future!
0	do nit book this hotel. Dirty hotel with questionable people living in the hotel.
0	Other guests ruin the experience.... Spent one night at the BB and on the whole, the place was nice. I want everyone to know that my low grade was based on a single experience and I have not been to this BB enough times to say how that grade would average over multiple stays. The staff was great, the room was large, and the location... More
0	My Stay!. the hotel was beautiful! the staff friendly but the room was missing a few amenities such as no cream or sugar for coffee. Bell man left me in the hotel lobby with a full cart, 2 kids and a small dog in crate, after i had tipped him to take me upstairs. I had to manage by myself. Manager was very nice and gave us a comp breakfast buffet.
1	Ultra Modern. Hotel was a fantastic location. The room was unique and we'll maintained. Enjoyed the blue light located throughout the property. Bed was conformable, however small. Good and happy vibe. 1 opportunity I would make for improvement is the timeliness for valet. Car retrival took well over 30 mintutes. I noticed their bell staff was not around and the lobby hardly have anyone in it. When you are paying 30+ for valet it should be rocket speed. Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We are delighted to hear that you enjoyed your time here and we hope you will come back and see us again. Parking and valet services can take some time because our parking lot is located six blocks off-site. We are happy that even though you experienced issues with this you still enjoyed your stay.
1	Wardog66-70. I commend the staff at Drury for achieving some of the highest quality customer service I've experienced. So often employees get jaded, bring their personal lives into work, and/or generally take out their personal problems with others at the workplace. The week we were there we enjoyed smiles and pleasantries every morning from the ladies at breakfast, Rosa (room attendant), and those working the desk. Not to leave out Jonathan, Jeremy, and Brandon, our Valet's. These guys were very pleasant and gave off a great spirit while taking care of our vehicle making sure it was always ready to roll, often on short notice. I witnessed them actually running to provide positive service for us and other guests. All in all everyone we came in contact with were great representatives for this company. I will continue to seek out Drury for our travels. I'm Wardog and I approve this message.
1	First trip to NOLA. We had a great experience at the St. Charles Inn. Our stay with BW Plus' are always great. The staff were very friendly, beds nice and comfy too. Secure parking and right on the trolley line so it could not have been more convenient for site-seeing. Breakfast was good, nice selection to choose from. We will definitely stay here on our next visit!I hope you were able to do a lot of site-seeing while staying with us! I'm glad you enjoyed our location, breakfast, and staff. Give us a call when you are ready to come back! Thank you for reviewing your stay!Kathleen Davis, Front Office Manager
0	DO NOT DO STOP HERE. I just have to doubt that real people, in real life, rated this hotel as excellent. I booked this hotel based upon the tripadvisor ratings along and it was a big, big mistake. Let me begin by saying the picture shown for this hotel (which I looked at carefully before i booked) in no way resembles the room I was... More
1	Beautiful Hotel!. Such a beautiful hotel! LOVED the lobby and the bank vault. It was so unique and interesting. Our suite was so beautiful and very comfortable. We would like to thank the staff for taking such good care of us.Your knowledge of your wonderful city was so helpful. The Russells Thank you for your review of the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans! We're so happy to hear you enjoyed your stay and we appreciate the feedback. If there is anything we can do to make your next visit to the Whitney better, please don't hesitate to let us know. Thank you and we look forward to seeing you again soon!Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
1	A graet stay in DC. Great place to stay if you want to go to DC The room was very good, we had a welcome gift waiting in our room which was very nice. The staff was very helpfull and gave us at check-in unasked very usefull info about the surrounding area and ways to travel within DC. Our room was on the opposite side of the highway and onthe 2nd floor with no highway noise. The hot breakfast (eggs, waffles, grits, oatmeal, etc.) is very good and the same everyday but there is enough of a variety. The shuttle will take you anywhere within 3 miles and to the DC Metro station, all you have to do is call and they will pick you up as well. The pool is very clean and all day there's a lifeguard, the pool was a great way to cool off after walking all day around DC!
1	Good airport hotel, would recommend for business travellers. The Hilton Garden Inn is conveniently located about 2 miles from the Orlando Airport. I decided to use this hotel since I had to spend the week working at a facility right next to the airport. Check in was quick and easy and since I was a Hilton Honors member, I was offered to have points added to my account in lieu of breakfast. This was the first time, a Hilton employee has ever asked me this question during check in (thumbs up!). Room was nice and clean and also very quiet (the two things I value the most). This Garden Inn is also located within walking distance to a pharmacy and lots of restaurants, which is a plus for any out of town guests that do not have a vehicle. The only somewhat negative experience was when I asked about larger room availability, as I plan to come back to Orlando in a month with the family. The employee did not sound very interested in trying to assist me with room information and rates, so I guess, I will find another hotel in the area for that trip. In all, while I plan to use another hotel during my next trip to Orlando, I would still recommend this Hilton Garden inn to any business travelers in the area.Dear guest Dansladen:Your effort and time in sharing your comments surrounding your experiences during your last stay is most appreciated and something we take very seriously. Please accept my sincere apologies for any aggravation or inconvenience you may have experienced during your visit.We are constantly monitoring the performance of our team member to make sure our valuable guests as yourself is welcome with an efficient and pleasant front desk procedure that provides the accommodations and service you expect. We want our guests to be met with a well-trained staff that puts guest comfort and satisfaction before everything else. I am sorry if this was not your experience. I cannot agree more with you in the matter that it was poorly handle by our associate and I can assure you that this incident will be address to all associates to avoid this for happening again.Once again, please accept my most sincere apologies and I cannot thank you enough for expressing your concerns I hope that you can give us the chance and contact me directly to proof to you how serious we take this issues and how important you are for us. We value you as a guest, and I do want you to know that your concerns are our concerns!. Sincerely,Alex Blanco
1	Fantastic Stay. I really enjoyed my stay at the Hampton Inn and Suites Napa. The staff were very friendly and the facilities were excellent. There is a free buffet breakfast, wine tasting from 5-6pm and a tea/coffee station in reception all day. The pool is heated and the outdoor areas are really well maintained. I had a very relaxing stay and would definitely recommend it.Dear ACNolan,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We are very honored to have earned your recommendation and thankful you enjoyed your stay with us. It's great to hear that you had a relaxing time with us and we hope to see you again soon. Warmest Regards, Serina Najar.
0	Its Seldom I really flame a Marriott Property: this was inexcusable. I have stayed at this hotel before without any problems. I am a Marriott Platinum member, so I always get placed on the Concierge floor. This time the hotel checked me into Room 420 on the top floor. When it was time to go to bed, I found the bed to be HARD AS A ROCK. I was used to the luxurious Marriott Beds (they sell the mattresses), but this thing was impossible. It was late and I ended up sleeping on the Duvet Cover for some padding. When I reported this they said they would take care of it. The next day after work (after getting little sleep the night before), I tested the bed. Another very thin pad had been placed on the bed. I had had it. I called the Manager to come to the room and housekeeping. The housekeeper was fantastic. She knew just want to do. While she was padding my mattress I noticed something unusual. The tag on the mattress said Beauty Rest, Custom Made for Hyatt Hotels. This particular hotel had not been a Hyatt since 2003!! (And who knows how long the mattress had been there, so it was AT LEAST 10 years old). The manager explained he was sorry but that they had budgeted for new mattresses. COME ON. This hotel charges Michigan Avenue rates and is NOT close to downtown. I could not believe it. On the positive side, the host in the Concierge Lounge was incredible. The breakfast was amazing and the service was great.Finally when I checked out, I noticed an added room charge. I complained and was told I would have to come down to the desk at check out. I gave the erroneous bill to the desk staff. She looked at it and I told her which one was billed erroneously. Then she said what day is that... Good grief.. she was LOOKING at the bill. Finally just said Take the charge off now. I guess from talking to the manager that it is hit or miss whether you can a new or an old mattress. And after all, a good nights sleep is a BASIC requirement for business travel. I will not stay here again... period... obviously customer comfort is not 1.And what did I get my all this trouble 1,000 extra points. That's it, Marriott UIC.. None of my business for you!
1	Wonderful stay in New Orleans. We stayed for 7 nights at the Bienville House in New Orleans over Christmas 2011. The stay was wonderful! We were able to switch rooms to one with a view of the Mississippi and to be able to see the ships and even the Natchez cruise by our window was great. The only concern was the street noise at night but it was the holidays and the French Quarter was full of visitors so it was sort of expected. This boutique hotel was decorated very nicely, the king 4 poster beds were exceptional and even the continental breakfast served from 7:00 - 10:00 am was pretty good. I would definately stay here on a future stay.Dear crdonahue, Thank you for choosing the Bienville House on your recent trip to New Orleans. We are so happy to hear you enjoyed your stay and look forward to your return.
0	In desperate need of updating. Stayed here for business. Nice enough staff, but when I stayed there a storm blew through. At 3:00 a.m. I was awakened by the wind whistling through my terrace door. I tried stuffing towels it the gap that was making the noise but to no avail. All night long a whistling sound kept me up, even with earplugs. Super slow... More
1	Perfect location - down the street from Pike Place. Ok, for those that are wondering in Seattle where to stay, I successfully picked out the two hotels that are close to all attractions, reasonably priced and had a jacuzzi for helping with the soreness of the feet from walking around to all the attractions! Grand Hyatt and the Sheraton. I had stayed at the Sheraton, which had a nice jacuzzi on top, but wanted to try the Grand Hyatt. We pulled in, had a room readily available, and went to our room. The bathrooms are huge and my wifed loved this. No complaints about the room. The hotel had a nice gym where I was able to workout in the morning with a few of the LA Angels prior to playing the Mariners. Very nice gym with a connecting jacuzzi area. They also had a sauna and a very large and hot! steam room. Connected to the hotel is a really nice Sushi restauant, which if you like sushi, you should check this out as the dishes roll around the restaurant on little conveyer belts. They also had a NY deli style place to grab sandwhiches and a Starbucks. I would stay here. They guys running the valet are very professional as you could tell they know their stuff. The front desk check in was very pleasant. But, one word of caution...nothing to fault of the hotel but more the city of Seattle. My wife and I fell asleep Sunday night around 8pm, thinking we were going to wake up and head out to a restaurant. At 12:15 am, I was out of luck to getting any type of food. Room service closed, so the only thing I could purchase was small little crackers and cookies from the front desk. Not a big deal, but you would think in a city that size you could walk to some place and get a sandwhich. In the morning, I didnt see breakfast, so I think it was all room service. BUT, dont eat there, walk 6 blocks to the Pikes Market and go to Le Panier or Poscky's for pastries. Wonderful Go there early and beat the lines! Eat breakfast at Lowells for crab-dishes.
0	Price Was Right But. This hotel is in an area of Richmond that is less than desirable. We booked it because it wasn't far from Richmond airport where we arrived late evening and didn't want to travel far our first night in Virginia. Waited at front desk for 15 minutes before someone showed up to check us in. The price was right and the... More
0	I don't think so.... Well, My family and I went for a 3 night getaway to the Mandarin. It seemed like a fair price and a fun thing to do. Well, here was the thing. The room was pretty small... and the service was lousy. Let me tell you why. When we asked for our room to be made up while we were away for a couple hours, they said of course. We were out a couple hours and the room wasn't made up. Then we called again. They said of course again. And we went back out for a few hours to get lunch. Yet, when we returned the room wasn't made up!! Now, if you want to get a bite at Cafe Sambal that's another story. (It was amazing) But, do not stay here. The grounds are nice, and so is Cafe Sambal but nothing else.Dear Valued Guest, Thank you for your recent review of Mandarin Oriental, Miami on Trip Advisor. Your constructive comments are very important to us. I am delighted that you enjoyed your dining experience in Caf Sambal it is truly one of the best sushi restaurants in Miami having been recently voted top five by Passport Miami in one of their recent readers poll. Regarding the rest of your stay back in May, I am saddened to hear that your experience fell short and that you felt the room was small. We have many different category rooms all of which are on par in size with other luxury choices in the Miami. Please ask a reservation agent for more options and prices that may better fulfill your expectations. Pertaining to the lapse in service by housekeeping, we sincerely apologize that the room was not cleaned in the timeframe you requested. We do our best to accommodate all service requests. This is definitely an isolated incident that has been addressed with the housekeeping management to ensure it does not re-occur. I hope you will give us another opportunity and request that you contact the Executive Office for your future reservation. I will ensure you have a seamless and enjoyable visit. Sincerely, Greg Nunez Hotel Manager
1	Excellent!. This hotel was really great! I had read many reviews of hotels in the area before booking, and this one was a winner in most categories and I can see why! The room was excellent, very clean, very modern, very nice. The only reason I went down on the comfort was that I found the bed to be a little hard for my liking, but I have back issues, so that could be why. The staff was amazing. I ended up becoming very ill, and they were very accommodating and empathetic, and that was greatly appreciated. The breakfast was excellent, a good spread with many options. The pool and hot tub were nice, especially in the evening. The location is directly on the beach, and the balconies allow for a fantastic view (even when you are lying ill on the couch!). I would most definitely stay here again, and it was an excellent price, making it that much better!
0	Decent Place to stay but it's too noisy near the highway.. We have arrived after 4:00 pm to get our keys and we observed that the rooms was recently clean by hotel staffs. We booked our rooms on-line and the price was reasonable. We came to this place to shop at the Birch Run Premium Outlets Mall with our Canadian Families, Relatives and Friends but some of them couldn't make it... More
0	Dirty and poor customer service. My family are Disney annual passholders so we wanted to drive up for an overnight and get an extra evening in. We decided to stay here because some of the other hotels we normally stay at were booked. I read the reviews re: the parking, so I was prepared. Also ready the reviews re: the bad coffee...nothing still prepared me for the horrible stuff they serve. No hot water for tea either.The room just had a general feel of being old and tired. My eight year old grandson panicked when he went to take a shower. He felt as if he was using towels someone else had used.What was the true kicker was when we left. My daughter-in-law left her makeup bag in the room.When we had left a different Anaheim hotel a few months before, they called immediately because I had left my sunglasses there.No one called her.She arrived home and since we arrived late, didn't notice until she was getting ready for work the next day.She called the hotel. At first they said it wasn't there, then changed their minds and said it was.When the bag arrived a few days later - 1/2 of her makeup was missing! (Naturally, the more expensive makeup.)She called the hotel and asked to speak to the manager. He wasn't available. She asked when. They said he would arrive in the late afternoon and he would call her.No call.She called back. Was told she had just missed the manager and the manager wouldn't be until Monday.She called Monday am. The manager wasn't in. She should call back.She wasn't able to talk to manager until Tuesday -- about 4 days AFTER her first call.The manager denied anything was missing. no comments such as: I'm so sorry...I'll look into it. Just a plain denial.We will never, ever stay here again.
0	Hmmm... Annex. So I booked this room before looking at the reviews. Honestly, your opinion is all going to vary upon your expectations. Almost everything that everyone wrote was true. The paper states 2 queen beds, which were actually full beds. The beds were probably the best thing in the room. The dresser drawers do continue to open, so there may also be ghost in there. It had a bathroom, the toilet ran the entire time, but it worked. The bathrooms are very outdated, but everything worked. The shower was clean and water pressure sucked per expected. Now.. one of the nastiest things is looking up and seeing vomit all over the bathroom moldings, all I wondered was how did that get there The elevator was suspect and you could possibly fear for your life until it opens. I can see myself staying there again, if the price is right. Like I said, its all on your expectations. I didn't expect much, so it turned out not that bad. Good location. The downstairs diner food was good.
1	Clean, beds are comfortable and AC is cold!. Kinda pricy! But if you want clean and comfortable rooms with a cozy bed, this is the place. Right by the airport and if you get in late TGIF is open late and not too far. If you like to sleep in...well this is the kicker, it gets loud in the hallway. House keeping makes sure they wake everyone up to get you out so they can do their job. It is about 7 miles to Disney stuff. Would stay here again. It is especially gratifying for me as Housekeeping Manager to read that you enjoyed our rooms so much and I can assure you that I have personally spoken with my team regarding the noise level in the hallways. Please accept my apology for not being as considerate as we should have been. Thank you for pointing out that despite our close proximity to the Orlando International Airport, we are also really only minutes away from the main Orlando attractions. We cannot wait until your next visit! Please socialize with us on Facebook and Twitter so you may get advance information on deals with us.
0	Terrible. Before our travel we called ahead and was quoted a price of 371 for 2 people per room. When we got there the owners wife denied that and tried to overcharge us. She had a bad attitude with us then on. Also she made it clear that they would only be cleaning our room once a week since we had... More
1	Updates are great, but somethings were skipped. This hotel recently went through an update in regards to the furniture and televisions. I have to say that they did a great job. They didn't. however, replace the tile in the bathrooms to match the rest of the updates, which is a shame. The tub and pedestal sink looked new, but the toilet did not. But I have to say, that the bathroom was the cleanest I have ever seen. Not even one stray hair on the floor! The kitchen also skipped the update, but it was still nice to have a fridge, microwave and stove. All the essential items like utensils, dinnerware and cookware were stocked in the cabinets. Also, there is no wi-fi in the rooms, you have to go to the lobby. There is only a plug for high speed internet located in the room. The hotel is a great bargain for staying near D.C. and I would stay there in a heartbeat.
0	Not worth it. First the room was super tiny. Like so tiny you could sit on the toilet and reach out and touch the bed. We could hear rats running in the ceiling. There were several holes in the sheets. It is not worth the money and there are so many other great choices in Chicago. Hello kellydD9581QQ,Thank you for choosing to stay at Chicago River Hotel and providing feedback about your experience. Please know we do offer different room types of different sizes to suit the different needs of our travelers. Our smallest room type is small but should have all essentials someone should need for their stay. In regards to your comment about rats, this is not true. We do not have rats in the ceiling nor anywhere else in the building and take this very seriously. If you would like to discuss this matter in more detail I can be reached at rgradyclubquarters.com or 312-777-0978.Ryan GradySenior Guest Services Manager
0	Slightly disappointed.... We are regular Hyatt customers and are loyal because of the consistent quality and service. While everyone here is very nice, the pool is not kept up and the TV reception is TERRIBLE. It is August and our granddaughter wants to swim. The pool is cloudy, full of leaves and very uninviting. Breakfast was also disappointing...powdered eggs and out of... More
0	KEEP DRIVING!. As bad as it looks! We had drove for more than 12 hours and it was storming. The 3 towns up to this point was completely booked, so we had to stop but I REALLY wish we didn't! Dirty, ceiling was falling in and the place was horribly decorated Like waking back in time to like 1950s Ended up sleeping... More
1	Very comfortable, good value. Room was very clean, beds comfortable. Breakfast typical for this type of hotel - 3 or 4 hot items (varied by day), cereal, fruit, yogurt, donuts, etc.. Pool area very small. Very convenient access to Mission Bay park (could actually walk there, but we drove to it), Sea World, easy drive to Old Town and Balboa Park, and airport. Not a bad drive to La Jolla, downtown and other attractions. Not a lot of restaurants nearby, but enough for a few days - a couple fast food, pizza, ribs. Grocery store nearby. There was probably a lot more not much farther, we just didn't have a need to look more.Hello,Thank you for sharing your trip experience here at the Best Western Mission Bay. I am glad you were happy with our accommodations and staff. Thank you for your compliments to our location, just within walking distance to Mission Bay and five minutes away from Sea World. Should you return to San Diego area, please feel free to contact me directly for all your reservation needs. You can reach me at 619-275-5700 ext 393 or Lpradohotelpros.bizOnce again, thank you for staying with us!Leidy PradoFront Office Manager
0	Yukky. Towels are yellow and gray, wallpaper is dirty and marked, room is musty and smelly, carpet looks 30 years old, furniture is mismatched, scuffed, phones are old, the building is old and falling apart. The only nice area was the lobby.V C,I apologize our property was not to your standards and that out staff failed to accomadate you during your stay. I will go over this review with my staff to help us all improve on these little details. We are currently working on renovating and improving a lot of things in our property. I hope we have not loss your business and you may consider giving us a second chance. We would like to see you visit us again in the near future!Thank you for taking the time to leave us a review. Sincerly,Laura Benson
0	HOT WATER ISSUES!. Seriously...we stay at this property every year for market week. No matter what if you get in the shower past 7AM you will have a cold one! It is so frustrating. No use calling maintenance as they will not be able to fix it. If we were not mandated by our company to stay there we would be looking for a new place to rest our heads.Also...when the hotel is full breakfast can get a little sketchy...just saying.Other than that...the rooms are fine but starting to show their wear.Dear JuliMcG,Thank you for taking a few moments to write a review about your recent stay. My apologies on the water temperature you experienced during your stay. We value your continued loyalty to the hotel and hope to have marked improvements before your next stay for a market show.Hospitably Yours,Andrew May General Manager
1	Best hotel value in NOLA!. Cannot say enough good about this hotel. Sometimes I pick obscure places to stay on vacation...but our 2 teens have declared that I have redeemed myself with this hotel pick! Everything here is new, fresh, modern, and clean. Huge rooms. Huge living area with sofa bed, desk, chairs, TV huge bedroom with 2 queens, TV, bench huge bathroom, etc. The absolute best part is the breakfast and dinner/cocktail hour. Breakfast is a real buffet with sausage, scrambled eggs, potatoes, biscuits, waffles, pastries, etc. Even more surprising, the cocktail/snack hour really is a light dinner buffet. They have a salad bar, baked potato bar, a pasta dish, chicken strips, hot dogs, soup, nachos, chips/salsa, etc. We decided to just make a meal of it the night we arrived. Great for kids. You are able to get 3 drinks/person each evening: 4 kinds of wine, Bud Light on tap, margaritas, and several cocktails/mixed drinks. They also have coffee and a soda fountain. The lobby has a refreshment station with popcorn, a soda fountain, and 24/7 coffee. The hotel is a couple block walk to the SuperDome, and a reasonable 10 minute (safe) walk down Poydros to the riverfront, including the big Hilton, Harrah's, and the outlet mall. From there, it's a few blocks East to Jackson Sqaure/Cafe du Monde, etc. The cross street here becomes Bourbon St. When it crosses Canal St. (The official divider between the French Quarter and the CBD), so you're really right in the heart of the action in a 10 min walk that direction also. Great location all around! They valet park everything, but have a massive motor court where they can pull around 15+ cars at a time, so no problem there. We will definitely choose this hotel for our next visit to the Big Easy!
0	Horrible experience. I requested a non-smoking room due to having asthma. I was very tired that night and just wanted to sleep. Well once I entered the room, I felt like I just went into a cigar bar. It was awful. The smoke smell was so strong. I attempted to call the front desk but the phone wasn't working. No dial tone at all. It was 1am and I was so tired that I just fell asleep on the bed. The smoke smell kept waking me up till I had to put the blanket over my head the whole night. A roach was also on the nightstand and rug stains all throughout the room. Most disgusting experience from a hotel in my life.
0	Hotel Parking. Hotel Parking Garage poorly lit and in need of upgrading allowing access directly to hotel without going down stairs.
0	Not very kept up. The hotel is very rundown. I was very disappointed. The mattresses were terrible you could feel Springs
1	The Best Hotel in NY. We have stayed here many times and it is by far the best hotel in New York City. The staff is fabulous - attentive without being overbearing. Go see Catherine in the Restaurant/Lounge - her service is impeccable. The rooms are well appointed. This time we had a non-view room but it meant we were tucked back in the corner of the hotel and so quiet. We never heard anything. Love this hotel.We are so appreciative of you taking the time to share this wonderful review about The Ritz-Carlton New York, Central Park, and I'm so happy you had yet another wonderful stay with us! Travel + Leisure's readers voted us as the 1 Hotel in NYC last year, and we are delighted to know that you could not agree with them more! Thank you for being our loyal guest, and we look forward to welcoming you back again soon.Kind Regards,Elizabeth MullinsGeneral Manager
1	Good quality at the reasonable rate. I stayed for 5 nights at this hotel while I was attending a technical meeting at a nearby resort.PROS1. A reasonable nightly rate (probably not the cheapest though)2. Good free breakfast that includes juice, coffee, milk, tee, cereal, toast, bagel, waffle, pancake, egg scramble, bacon, apple, banana etc ... Breakfast area is large enough.3. Good location: close to the highway and walking distance to the Sea World4. Good wifi connection5. Good front desk staffs - I liked the gentleman during the daytime in particularCONS1. The room was clean (and good enough for me) but not fancy2. House keeping could be improved - Their service was not quite consistent.Overall, not much to complain!Check-in/check-out process was smooth and quick.
0	Worst Fairfield Ever. Took my wife for a ski trip on her Birthday in mid February. I booked the Residence Inn in Bozeman and Fairfield Inn with the same non-refundable terms. (Note: both are Marriott family hotels) The Good 1) Easy check-in 2) Reasonably clean 3) Candy bar at check-in for Elite (Not a big deal but nice) The Bad 1) I had... More
1	A few issues, but overall good. Stayed here twice in the past 2 weeks. Accessible room both times. First the bad - I called the hotel within 45 minutes of checking out - very early morning. I realized I had left my ring on the table next to the bed and asked if they could please check on it immediately. They promised to call me back - they never did. Due to my early checkout and my prompt call, I doubt the cleaning staff had even entered the room. So, I'm very unhappy about the ring - nothing overly expensive, but it did have some sentimental value.Accessible rooms themselves were much more adequate than most - we have a lot of experience in this area, and many accessible rooms are NOT truly accessible. For our second stay we were given a room that was on the top floor and the furthest room from the elevator. In an emergency, we would have never gotten out of that hotel. My husband is in a wheelchair. There is no way we would have made it down 9 flights of stairs, and trying to get 2 children and a manual wheelchair to the elevator was tiring and difficult. WHY don't hotels use a little common sense and realize that accessible rooms on LOWER floors would be more logical We were offered no assistance with luggage either stay.A huge plus for this hotel is that they are one of the very few hotels in Philadelphia that offer 2 Queen beds in a room. However, I was told by the front desk staff that none of the Queen rooms face the street. So, the windows in these rooms basically face other 'inside' rooms and offer very little light. The hotel is fairly new, so the rooms do not have the tired and worn appearance that many hotels in Philadelphia do.Location for this hotel is very good. Very close to Jefferson University Hospital, Chinatown, Magee Rehabilitation hospital, restaurants, city hall, etc. Breakfast leaves a lot to be desired, but then again, yogurt, cereal, juice, beats 40+ for a family breakfast at a restaurant each day. I would do away with the microwave items altogether though.Price was very good, location great. While they could have done better in several areas, we plan to stay again.
0	If you are DESPERATE for a place to stay. My fianc and I decided to have a last minute moment of relaxation over the weekend (June 25,2016) before our upcoming July 9th wedding so we decided to hit the beach and stay for an evening. I will say the woman who helped me book over the phone was lovely and the front desk person was also wonderful. We walked into our room at The Annex on the third floor and I walked out after just 15 minutes. The front desk was called and we unfortunately could not switch rooms or hotels so we decided to just check out and leave. The room felt grimy it was scorching hot, cigarette burns on the floor, dirty ceiling and my city view was a garage. It did not smell clean or pleasant. I was so disappointed. The front desk person was VERY apologetic and said he would try to get me a full refund. I saw that this hotel was under the Cape Resorts Group and that is so sad because I have had wonderful experiences at the Virginia Hotel and Congress Hall. This was just a bad experience and waste of money that I may never be refunded, which is awful especially when its just 2 weeks before my wedding and we tried to spend our money as wisely as possible. Disheartened.***Horrible hotel but very nice people working there.
0	Horrible!. I called the manager Matt for two straight weeks and left multiple messages. He felt it was unnecessary to return any of phone calls so my stay was ruined. I would never stay here again.
0	Close to Coliseum. The temperature in the room was inconsistent. It was either to hot or to cold. The unit did not maintain the temperature I selected which was really uncomfortable at night while trying to sleep. The fabric shower curtain was dirty. It had stains and what appeared to be dried up shampoo with hair.
0	TERRIBLE!. don't do it. it may save you money, but you will regret it. you get what you pay for, and in the case of this hotel, you don't get what you don't pay for.
0	Not impressed. We have always been extremely satisfied with the Holiday Inn Express hotels that we have stayed in in the past, especially the breakfast buffets, and that was why we again chose a Holiday Inn Express when we were passing through the Baltimore area. Were we ever wrong on this one!! The buffet was very limited, hardly any hot items and what was supposed to be hot was actually stone cold (i.e. the gravy for the biscuits). The biscuits were rock hard. The scrambled eggs were a very bad version of imitation. Seemed like the person running the buffet was using week old biscuits and figured the warming lamps would heat up the gravy so she did not have to. I have never had a worse breakfast anywhere. If you are planning on getting your fill at this buffet - forget it. We had to go out to breakfast after checking out just to keep from starving. We hadn't balked at the room fee because we assumed the buffet would be worth the extra money - Boy were we wrong!!
0	Not clean. Had a Bad experience here. Bugs were crawling up the Curtains and the Cieling. I killed a few and housekeeping didn't even clean the mess. Aweful. I should have take pics.
1	Great stay at Disney!. Wonderful hotel, great location, excellent staff, Front Desk is just fabulous, and all facilities are good. This would be the ideal place for the family when they visit Disney. The surroundings are very family-friendly with a lot of eateries around. The hotel staff is very helpful at all times. Rooms are very comfortable and convenient. Amenities are good.Dear Vinayak S, Thank you for sharing your experience at the TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium.With a mission to provide superior customer service, we take great pride in serving your needs and are delighted to hear that we have met your expectations.

1	Excellent Boutique Hotel. My partner and I decided to try what looked like a quirky hotel in PHX for a Valentine's Day getaway. The moment we walked in we knew we'd found a winner. The place was teeming with interesting people, the walls were adorned with local art and the smells from the kitchen made our mouths water. The staff was super friendly and attentive and every aspect of the hotel lived up to our expectations: great bed, wonderful room, outstanding food/drink. Thank you so much for this amazing review! We are so happy to hear you had a wonderful time! Please visit us again soon.
1	Great location, excellent personnel. We stayed at this hotel a few days ago, and it was a pleasant surprise. The hotel was really clean, and checkout was a breeze. To get a hotel with free parking, great location and pleasant personnel is really a find in Orlando. We have family there so it is not our first stay in Orlando, from now on this will be our go to place. grant03Dear Guest grant2003, I would like to thank you for taking the time to share your experience with your recent stay. We want our guests to have the best stay possible where everything is like new, in place, of the highest quality, and in perfect working order.

0	This picture does not show the wear and tear these rooms have.. Ok I know the Motel 6 is suppose to be cheap and economical for lodging. But this goes beyond cheap. The room I was in had a bed on a pedestal but it also had torn weathered box spring showing. The bed was horrible. The cover on the bed was worn and stained. The hot and cold water in the... More
0	CAUTION - NOT what is pictured. I would highly suggest people call before they arrived. From start to finish it was disgusting. dust, construction, tiny bathrooms, such a let down and waste of money. I totally was shocked because it was not at all what was pictured. I would suggest you call before arriving.
0	Disappointed. I was really disappointed. Upon checking in, we were told our reservation had cancelled . I hadn't cancelled it. Instead of a 2 bedroom, we got downgraded to a studio. We were traveling with 3 small children, including a baby who does not sleep well. The front desk also had the wrong credit card on file.
0	The worst hotel and the most expensive you can find!!. It is an absolut shame that this place (you can't even say hotel) can be so run down an abandoned. They have not fix or update anything for years and have the guts to charge 316.00 for one night. We stayed there because we had plans for the day and came by boat and did not have a car to... More
0	Wouldn't stay here again.. We read the other reviews on this motel and chose it based on these reviews, the pricing and the location, as it was right on our way to Vermont. Either we were not in one of the renovated rooms or the other reviewers' standards are very different than ours. The room we had was very tired and was not clean... More
0	BEDBUGS IN ROOM 102 on 12/8/14. This place should be shut down because it's so filthy. I have filed a complaint with the Rutherford County Health Department. There were Bedbugs in the room...even a bullet hole in the room's window. The room had stains all over the floor...God only knows what they were, and it smelled like something died in there the stinch was awful!
1	Heart of Chicago. Stayed here with my wife 7/26 27 hotel is in a great spot in the city just off of the river and directly across from the Trump building. It is within walking distance of Navy Pier and surrounded by great restaurants. The restaurant within the hotel has a very extensive menu though we didn't eat there. But we did have a few drinks and the staff is very hospitable. If the weather had been cooler we would have sat outside.The hotel was very clean and our room was nice the only thing I didn't like was there was no counter in the bathroom but this could have been because our room seemed to be handicap accessible, perhaps that was error in the reservation not sure.Overall it was fun staff was nice, hotel was clean, and we had a good trip.Thank you, Tyler W, for choosing the River Hotel and posting your review. We agree with you -- our prime location in the heart of Chicago is ideal for visiting and experiencing the city. We will be sure our dedicated staff members see your comments about the clean room and fun staff as they will be most appreciative.Please come see us again!
0	Madeline at reservations is terrible. I've been doing our company's reservations for over 5 years have never encountered anybody as rude as Madeline. Talks over us as, we're being billed for stuff that was not ok to be billed on the company credit card.
0	Dirty walls and spots on carpet. I stayed here for 2 nights. I read reviews from back in November that it was being remodeled. Thought by now remodeling would be done. Mattresses were comfortable, but pillows are horrible...Very knotty. This place should be closed until remodeling is done.
1	Great conference facility!. Beautiful hotel with very nice facilities for training sessions. Very very nice buffets with meal plan for breakfasts and dinners. Great location right across the awesome Lenox Square. Staff very professional and great attitudes. Rooms clean and very well appointed and beds SUPER comfortable. Lots of nice restaurants within walking distance, fun open air sitting area in front of hotel, and lovely Marriott club lounge.Stephanie - I am glad you enjoyed our facilities for your recent training session as well as the meals provided. We are definitely convenient to shopping and restaurants and I hope you were able to enjoy some time away from your training to complete your JW experience. Thanks for your post.
1	Convenient location. Stayed at the JW to do my Christmas shopping. Location of this hotel is great as it is connected to the Lenox Mall. The MARTA station is also across the street which provides convinient transfers to downtown. At check in, I was told that they don't have a non-smoking king room available but could put me in a double room. I took that room without hesitation. The room was on the 21st floor, with a great view the skyline of downtown Atlanta. Tried to use the in-room internet but went off-line while I was using it. I call the front desk and later a person who is in charge with the in-room system called me and said I could use their internet facilities in the business center at no additional cost. Room service was not bad too pricy. Bathroom is spacious and marbled.
1	Oasis in San Diego. I arrived to San Diego on Sunday, a worm sun welcomed me, it was a very good start, took a cab and after about 5 minutes the driver informed me we arrived, although we had a short drive I already saw the beauty of this city, the beautiful houses, the lovely sea, and the impressive marina.But all that was just the aperitif for a very pleasant surprise, we parked near a very small hotel, far from downtown, not impressive from the outside, after you put first step at the front door you start feel the special atmosphere that this hotel has to offer, very warm and wrapping dcor, on your right a nice bar, on your left a small reception with a smiling receptionist , but before I will talk about the people, few more things about the hotel, it build in a square shape when in the middle a small pool with comfortable sitting places. The owner created a wonderful place with great atmosphere.Few evening every week, people are gathering around the pool, on a big screen you can see an old movie, laughing, some dancing, drink, great food and lovely people..Lets talk about people, the personnel were great, very welcoming, helping in need, and even play there part in directing a tourist like me.I am talking about everyone I met there but still I bump with some more occasionally.( and I hope I spell each the name correctlyMarcella, the night worker who woke me up every morning, and welcomed me for a coffee at the lobbyJami, The bartender who was very nice, welcome and patient with all my questionsEmily, that made us the best Mojito everThank you all for a wonderful hosting, hope to see you againIVGIThank you very much for taking time to write a very detailed review of the Pearl Hotel. I am very fortunate to work with some amazing people. I will share your review with our staff!!!!!. Hope you will come visit us again soon. we appreciate your support.
0	Worst hotel ever. Steer clear of this hotel, which is really a motel. The walls are paper thin and we never slept due to rowdy people in the courtyard even past midnight. Our room was dirty and high priced. We have never stayed in a worse place.Dear Guest, Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. We greatly appreciate your business and loyalty to our brand.
1	Great stay and parking free. We love Drury Inns and were pleased with our stay in Atlanta. The staff was friendly and the rooms were clean, and spacious. Breakfast, though crowded this day, was good and well stocked. One employee was even helping people make waffles. We were also pleased that we could park for up to 7 days for free (subject to available space). We only had to fill out a form, which did clearly state that the hotel is not liable for any damages. That seemed fair enough, and we had no problems with our car while it was parked at the hotel for 3 nights. The location was very convenient to the airport (right off I-85) and the free shuttle service brought us right back to the hotel in minutes.
1	Avoid San Diego traffic. This is a great location and easy on/off from the highway. The zoo is under 3 miles away and Petco Park is under 5. There are other sights close by as well. If you want to minimize your driving in San Diego and still drive to some vacation spots, this is a great choice. Nice pool. No breakfast included but they have a restaurant. Also many other motels within walking distance that also have restaurants.Dear grb53,Thank you for the nice review! We appreciate your kind comments in regard to our convenient and freeway accessible location. As you mentioned, our hotel is just minutes from some of the premier attractions in San Diego including the Zoo and Petco Park. If you prefer to have breakfast included in your rate, we do offer a breakfast package available for an additional cost. Thank you for choosing our hotel for your San Diego lodging needs and were glad you enjoyed your stay!Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management Staff
1	Great Accomodations. I would highly recommend staying at this hotel. The rooms are spacious and highly accommodating. The hotel is clean. The food market located directly across the street is very interesting and they have anything you could possibly be craving. The coffee downstairs is free with to-go cups and it's actually delicious.Dear barbieann12,I would like to thank you for choosing the Home2 Suites by Hilton Philadelphia for your recent stay. I appreciate all of your great comments and I am glad you enjoyed your stay with us! With so many choices here in center city Philadelphia, we greatly appreciate your business and look forward to welcoming you back soon, until then...With Hospitality,Jason Bloom General ManagerHome2 Suites by HiltonYour Second Home Away From Home
0	Horrible is not a strong enough word.. Horrible service. Run down. Over-priced. Even the shower curtain was the wrong width (too narrow) for the shower. Sink clogged. Stains on furniture. Just gross. We stayed there only because our wedding reception was next door. Never again. So very disappointed. Don't let the lobby fool you. The only positive thing is the location.
0	Hotel. My wife and I would definitely not recommend this hotel. It was over priced, noisy, and not clean. The only accommodating person was the breakfast attendant. The rates go up a ridiculous amount during the week.
1	Great stay with minor items. Overall this is a great property. The lobby, restaurant, and hotel rooms are really well done. Lots of nice touches with great designs. Tons of character here. We stayed in a double queen room which we thought had plenty of space. The gym is located between two floors and has a Peloton bike and the hotel provides the shoes. As a cycling, I thought this was awesome. I already had a Peloton login. The music in the gym, however, was too loud and we called to have it turned down and the staff couldn't figure out how to do it. The staff were all friendly and courteous - bellhops, front desk staff and concierge all included. Location very convenient to a number of places downtown. Beds and pillows were comfortable. TVs changed channels without the annoying 1 second delay at most other hotels. There's some construction going on at the property next door to be aware of, but it's New York and good luck finding somewhere without construction. Definitely recommend.Dear chitripguy, Thank you very much for your detailed and wonderful review. I am so glad you enjoyed our property from our comfortable rooms and the gym. We pride ourselves in service and i'm very happy to read you've enjoyed your stay. Hopefully we get to welcome you back again in the future!Warmest Regards, Nick HaferGeneral Manager
0	Waiting for the reality tv camera crew suprise. Now like most reasonable people whove traveled a lot, we understand when you make a special request, motels cant always meet them. Were okay with that.What were not okay with is when motel proprietors make up silly excuses to avoid honoring advertised claims. And were also not okay with being threatened with refusal of service. Thats exactly what happened to us here.This was to be our 36th hotel stay in almost six months of travel across North America, and our first experience with the Motel 6 chain. It will also be our last.We booked a week prior to our stay through the Motel 6s national website, requesting a room with a fridge in our booking comments. The national (mobile) website lists an amenity for this motel as Free microfridge/some rooms. We received a confirmation booking email from Motel 6, showing our rate and our request.We read the statement Free microfridge/some rooms as some rooms (not all), have free mini-fridges. On check in, we were presented with a credit card charge that exceeded the amount in our confirmation email. On querying the difference, it was firstly explained as sales tax. Now whilst we mightnt be actuaries, even we could see the difference far exceeded any sales tax value and on querying further it became obvious there was a charge for the fridge. Sometimes misunderstandings and miscommunications occur. And were reasonable people willing to overlook issues if theres a valid explanation or compromise. This motel refused to honor the free part of the statement, offering that to us for an additional charge and suggesting that as it wasnt their personal website, there was no obligation on them to do so. The comedy routine got better though.We were asked for and provided evidence of our booking, and of the statement on the Motel 6 website (it was more a demand as in what website says that). The gentleman we dealt with was not prepared to compromise on this point however. He was insistent on making his point, which simply was that the rate in his computer system for rooms with fridges, was a higher rate.That he was rude, threatening and unwilling to compromise on such a minor point, and with such unreasonable excuses made us wonder if we were on one of those reality comedy shows you know the ones where people are deliberately rude and antagonistic, and then the camera crew rushes out and surprises you and everyone laughs. We saw no camera crew however and the comedy routine continued with him suggesting we cant just give things away. In our view, and for most other reasonable people, failing to honor advertised claims amounts to misleading and deceptive conduct. Giving an unreasonable excuse to disassociate a chain-branded property from its national brand simply to avoid honoring a small commitment demonstrates a lack of integrity. We also contacted Motel 6s national office via their website about our issue. On the first occasion they misread our concern, seeing it simply as being we asked for a fridge and didnt get one. On the second occasion, we received exactly the same worded, trained-monkey, form-letter response including (the almost condescending): the experience as you described, concerns us deeply. And the promised action on both counts Well send your comments to our Management Team for their review. Interpreted as were not going to do anything with your comments but hey, thanks for wasting your time and effort!We dont appreciate or accept this type of behaviour, and chose to take our business elsewhere. And were no longer waiting for the camera crew to appear.
1	Friendly Service and Comfortable Stay. I stayed at the JW Marriott for 2 nights for a conference held inside the hotel. Everything from security, air comfort, to the food and drink was A+. I want to make a special shout out to the security lady, wish I would have written down her name, who as a matter of walking through the hall asked me how my stay was going. I had a minor issue with the climate control in my room and told her about it. She was amazing. She had the issue solved within the hour, saw me later in the hotel and asked if I was satisfied. WOW.I have another worthy shout out to the server in the lobby lounge that expertly attended to my party of 5 travel weary guests. Her smile never wavered and I can assure you that we weren't an easy bunch that evening simply because we were hungry and tired. The lobby is beautifully appointed in such a way that I actually sighed with relief when I got there. And lastly, i love love love the fact that this hotel is directly across the street from the Lenox Street Marta stop making my dash to and from the airport an absolute breeze.Thank you for your glowing review. I will be sure to acknowledge our team for a job well done. Thank you for sharing. Please visit again.
0	Over Priced and Dirty Bedding. Besides the outrageous price and refusal to give a AAA discount because they were at quota for the day, the sheet on the king bed was too small and came off around the corners multiple times during the night. When the sheet came off, it revealed some type of thin covering over the mattress that was very dirty. I would... More
0	Leaves a lot to be desired!!. Nothing more than a glorified motel room. Charge like they are a resort, been here couple times not my choice, pool is green never clean, shower wont drain, I could go on but you get the jist. Only good thing is the boat hook up, but then better places have the same set up.
1	What an amazing Hotel!!! A+ in my book!!. This is a really wonderful hotel! We booked two rooms for our stay. We were there at 3pm and we were able to check into only one of them because the other wasn't finished being cleaned. They were going to call us when the other room was ready. We waited around for about an hour and we finally went back in and asked. We reserved a room with a balcony- well, they didn't have one. Even after waiting for an hour, they didn't have a room for us. We stood up there waiting for about 30-45 more minutes, and they decided to give us a room with a kitchen, living room area and a fireplace in lieu of what we reserved. I have to say, they were very accommodating and we appreciated the extra space. They were very nice and did all they could to make it right- and we were very happy about our room when we finally got it!! Now, on to the free breakfast that is offered....it is amazing!!! Biscuits, white gravy, oatmeal(with all kinds of toppings to put in it!), bacon, grits, eggs, hash browns, cereal, toast, bagels(all types of cream cheese and butter and jellies), coffee, hot chocolate, apple juice, cranberry juice, orange juice and milk...there was sooooo much! This place is really kept up and clean!! We will definitely be staying here again! Thank you for such an awesome trip!!
1	Great Location and Great Staff. Recently stayed at the St. Regis at the beginning of July. Our stay at the hotel was amazing and it was made even better by the friendly staff. The concierge, Eric, was extremely helpful in recommendations of where to eat and also what wineries to visit. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting San Francisco.Dear Melissa C,Thank you for sharing your review of your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco. I am delighted to hear that you had a wonderful experience and that our concierge team was able to assist you in planning your trip. Please do not hesitate to contact me directly, as we hope to welcome you back to the best address soon.Sincerely,Anthony DugganHotel Manager415-284-4057anthony.dugganstregis.com
0	Terrible. To be on a very important intersection like international Dr. Orlando this hotel is terrible. The bed was sunk in in the middle the tv is outdated plaster on ceiling in the bathroom I will never stay here again or recommend it to anyone. It really needs an upgrade.
0	old and pricey. This place is a dump. Paid over 130 for a non-river view. The rooms are old. I know it was not cleaned very well b/c there was a Graham cracker underneath my bed. The lamp was dusty. The carpet is disgusting and filthy. The bathroom floor was slippery weird. This room should not be 130, more like 50. The front... More
1	Perfect location and best staff from top to bottom!. Bad: Only thing I would have changed is the climate control. It did not go anywhere near as high as I would like for it to go. Maybe it was just my room, but definitely could have been cooler. Good: Got more than what I expected from this hotel! They let me choose what floor I wanted to be on, which I've never gotten from anywhere else. Location is PRIME. Fremont Street is right outside their doors! The room is just like any other average hotel. It was very clean and comfortable. Michael Ovalles was very helpful in showing us around. He also helped us get our player cards and a complimentary deck of cards to enjoy our stay!
0	Dirty. I've been staying in a lot of Hampton hotels lately and this was the dirtiest one to date. The hallways needed to be vacuumed, and the room was not very clean. The heating/cooling systems sounded like a jet was taking off every time it turned on. Also, I felt it was loud. Not sure if it was just the people... More
1	Very nice inn, awkward bathrooms, expensive. We booked a 3-bedroom cabin at the Pantai inn. It was located on the rear of the property, with a partial ocean view from the living/dining areas and small balcony that faced an alley. The dcor was lovely, the living/dining rooms spacious, it sported a full kitchen, and the beds and pillows were very comfortable. The only downside were the two bathrooms. They were very small and awkward, scarcely large enough for one person. In ours, the mirror was to the side of the sink, so you had to bend over and turn your head to see yourself. The tissue holder was a metal plate fastened to a hole in the wall, and it was oxidized and kept coming off. The dated tub did not drain properly and filled partly with water when we showered. The shower head and water pressure were great, but I would have expected a more luxurious, well-designed bathroom from such an expensive place. Apart from that, our stay was great, and the staff were very nice.Greetings ECrowther, Thank you for taking the time to review Pantai Inn. The team and I were so pleased that you had an overall enjoyable experience. Between the room amenities, the decor, and the comfort of your nights rest - these were all very positive. It does seem that above all there was one item that would have put us over the top during your stay. I apologize that we fell short in delivering this. After reading your review, I have personally reached out to you to address this situation. Please do not hesitate to follow up with me when you have time. Eager to have the opportunity to welcome you back. All my best, Mike
1	It's a gem. The Pearl is a first rate little hotel at which the staff and management obviously care about what they do. They kindly allowed me to stash a piece of luggage there two weeks in advance of my stay and they had it waiting for me in my room upon my arrival. Check in took all of two minutes and the host was friendly and efficient. Both the wake up call and taxi I asked for were expedited without worry. The room was large enough, spotless and had a warm charm with a comfortable bed. The plumbing and shower pressure were excellent. I can't comment as to whether it was noisy since I was tired enough to have slept through anything. I got a bite to eat at the bar and the food was tasty and served up by a helpful and polite barman. If you stay at the Pearl you won't be disappointed but be aware that you'll be charged for the boxes of water you drink that are provided in your room.Thank you very, very much for your great review. We are so honored that you chose The Pearl. Words cannot express our gratitude. Look forward to seeing you in the near future! Make it a great day.
1	No whining in the wine country. Ill be back! Clean and comfortable, with staff that will go above and beyond to make your stay wonderful. We came here for the Napa to Sanoma Half Marathon, and we are quite pleased with our choice. We knew we would not be in the room much, so price was what we were looking for. The Napa Valley is not cheep! But I felt the prices here were reasonable. The convenience of the shuttle to the start of the race was also a selling point for us. We saw many people driving here that morning parking across street to get here in time for the shuttle. AND! right across the street was a nice shopping center with many shops and fast food. Well done Best Western... Well done!Thank you so much for your review. We are really pleased you enjoyed your stay and hope you come visit us again.

1	Outstanding. My wife and I stayed here for one night. The hotel is located in a very nice complex of other hotels, with large green space surrounding the area. It's a very relaxing area. There are many chain restaurants located nearby for convenience. The hotel itself is immaculate and the staff was outstanding, especially Kara, who upon our early arrival was very accommodating and sweet. She got us in early an telephoned us as promised within an hour that the room was ready. She directed us to the cheapest gas prices, warning us of some other stations nearby. The boarding pass check-in and printing couldn't have been simpler or quicker, right next to the front desk, with all airlines listed. The room was a suite, with a separate bedroom and living area. The price was right, although the breakfast wasn't included. We were catching an early flight, but there was coffee and delicious lemonade in the lobby throughout the day. This was our first experience with the Hilton Garden Inn chain and we would go back. The Tripadvisor reviews were right on.I am so glad our staff, facilities and terrific location were all a big hit! Thank you so much for the five star review and taking the time to tell us about your recent stay. We want you to have a memorable experience in every regard and your comments motivate us to stay at the top of our game. We are glad we were successful in living up to our brands expectations thus providing you an outstanding stay. Whether your travels are for business or pleasure, we would love for you to come back and see us again soon. Sincerely,Alex BlancoGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando International Airport
0	Beyond Filthy. This place was worse than terrible! I reserved my dad a room for a funeral and i have to say that it was the worst place I've ever seen! The place was beyond filthy and smelly! They didn't even try to hide the filth, my brother found bed bugs in his room and decided to leave! Bottom line, STAY AWAY!!!!
0	Overpriced No frills. This place was a dud..Swimming pool was more like a bath tub... The view from the balcony was of a traffic light....Location is not bad, but not next door to vineyards...Worthy of no more than 75-90.Thank you for your review. We are always trying to lead in the best value in the Napa Valley. During the Harvest Season the demand is very high and we are inline with our competition and our average rate is one of the lowest in the valley. Tip: Best hotel rates are between November 11th and April 30th.
0	No towels, management didn't make it right.. After checking in, we went to the pool. We noticed that there were no pool towels so we dripped our way back to our room. In the room, we were surprised that there were no bath towels, only a few hand towels. I called the front desk and they told me they didn't have any dry towels, but would send... More
1	vacation. This is a good hotel for the money value. It is in a good location. Room are clean the breakfast good. I would recommend this to family friends. Finding a parking space coming back night was a bit hard but duable. We would stay here again on our next visit to San DiegoI appreciate you taking time to express your thoughts on your recent stay here at the Best Western Mission Bay. I am very glad that you enjoyed your stay and were happy with our Hot Continental Breakfast and rooms.When you return to the San Diego area, please do not hesitate to contact me for your reservation needs.

1	One of a kind. The quality of the staff is unparralled, better than any 5 star hotel I've visited. If you are looking for an impersonal chain hotel, this isn't it. Unique and quirky in a good way. Space is a premium, the rooms and bath are on the small side,....but not exceedingly so. Great room amenities, refrigerator, safe, plenty of power outlets and usb ports for charging electronics and even a mini bar with great snacks. And roof top deck for hanging out which was little used by the guest when I was there, so I had it all to myself. There's even a great cafe attached to the hotel with excellent food. But the real star was the staff. Always friendly, interested in the quality of your stay and very helpful at all hours of the day and night.Reading your review has brought me so much joy, thank you for sharing your experience with the rest of the world. I hope it entices others to enjoy our humble establishment as you have.William J Strickland Hotel Manager
0	Property is for Sale. Not operational when we went by. Looks very run down and overgrown with vegetation. So if you are looking for an investment property and a challenge this property would fit the bill. Good luck to the current owners and the new owners.
0	dirty rooms and uncaring staff. We booked a room at this hotel but didn't stay the night. We arrived and checked in and went to our room to find an extremely dirty bathtub and the vent hanging from the ceiling. We complained to the front desk girl who told us that that was common on the first floor because construction workers use those rooms and... More
1	Best Airport Hotel I've Experienced. I'm used to airport hotels being over crowded and worn down from the sheer crush of people going in and out. This goes double for ones in a tourist mecca like Orlando.But this property is far from that. We stayed for three nights over New Years, and were impressed from start to finish. Common areas were just as clean and polished as the rooms, and though we didn't use them, the pool, fitness room, and business centers all looked spiffy, clean, and well kept. The staff do an amazing job keeping things running well for guests, and it shows!We did use the restaurant after our late night arrival, and we were impressed there too. The cheeseburger was cooked just right, toppings were fresh and crisp, and the fries were outstanding. The wife had the chicken quesadilla and it too was way better than we might have assumed. Good beer and wine list as well, and we even snagged a mini bottle of prosecco to ring in the new year with later.Breakfast buffet was good also. Mostly standard fare, but all was cooked well, served hot and fresh, and coffee pot was never empty. Can't ask for too much more there.Overall, we had a great experience here. We normally don't use airport hotels, but of the ones we have used over time, this one sets a dang high bar. I'd definitely recommend it.
1	One Caveat. I booked through Hotwire was a little surprised to find breakfast not included--would have planned around that if I had known. The Shuttle service made up for that. Bed extremely comfortable, Nice lobby, friendly desk people....but....The noisiest plumbing I have ever experienced, anywhere! I do have acute hearing, but to wake up at 1:30 a.m. with the next room neighbor showering! Clunks, thunks, flushing---it might not bother everyone but it startled me, in an otherwise nice place. Trouble with their computer,trying to print a boarding pass, but the desk person was glad to help told me they were working on that.Thank you for taking the time to submit your review and especially for mentioning your positive experiences as well as improvement areas. It is through feedback that we are able to maintain and improve upon our service and product. I sincerely apologize for the plumbing noise and would greatly appreciate if you could contact us with your room number to give us a chance to investigate, since this is not a common occurrence. We hope that if you find yourself in Orlando next time, you will consider staying with us again.
0	Hotel description was deceiving.. I was not expecting a room with outside access. I would not have stayed there if I had know what to expect. The description listed the room as not ocean front. It should have stated it was in a separate building and that it was motel style. Air conditioner was located directly below the thermostat and there was one air conditioner and thermostat for both rooms sections in the suite. Could not maintain a comfortable temperature.
0	Very disappointed with this hotel .Hotel .com doe!. I was very disappointed with my stay . I was charged 270.00 dollars to my credit card for so called damage. I call to see what they were talking about and ask for pictures to be sent to my e mail .and ask to speak to Manger. Got the run around got hung up on after trying to see what they were talk about . Because room was left very clean . We only took a shower and slept we didn't even use anything else in are room. All towels were left in bathroom in a pile after we used them bed was clean . Are room was left in tact . They haven't refund my money back and has not show me what so called damages. So be aware of their scam !

BIG MISTAKE!!!! Order was screwed up with two meals not delivered until everyone else was through waiters changed in the middle, and the bill charged us one meal too much. Not happy.
1	Fantastic Addition to Waikiki. This hotel was absolutely fantastic we can not fault it. The room we had was stunning the views looking out to Diamond head and the ocean were amazing!! The location is perfect just off the main strip and a short walk to the new international market place. Cocktails are to die for make sure you take advantage of Happy hour!! The staff were very attentive to our every need they even provide sunscreen,towels, beach chairs, beach toys and a beach umbrella for FREE!!!!! It is little things like this that make this hotel a little gem on Waikiki definitely do yourself a favour and check it out!!Hi GarethIH,Thanks for choosing the new Hyatt Centric Waikiki Beach on your recent visit to Honolulu. We're glad you were able to take advantage of our beach supplies and see that you had the chance to enjoy our daily Happy Hour specials. We hope you'll join us again on your next visit to the island... Mahalo!
1	Very comfortable!. After staying at a hole in the wall nasty, dirty and druggie hotel in Daytona beach all week we were really happy to stay at a very nice, clean, comfortable and odor free hotel for the last night of our honeymoon. We had a great time in Daytona beach! Just make sure not to let pictures fool you when searching for a hotel. Read reviews closely !!! Sheraton is what we should of went with for the whole week! Sometimes you really do get what you pay for. I was more then happy to pay 99 for a quality room here at Sheraton. As soon as I walked in I smiled. Very accommodating, friendly and there was no doubt about clean bedding. Our room was amazing and it was the ideal place to stay. I can't say enough positive things about this hotel.Congratulations and thank you for taking the time to write about your experience! Our team was thrilled to read what a difference their passion for service made and we are happy that you enjoyed the comfort and quality that Sheraton is so well-known for. We look forward to being your choice hotel when your travels bring you back to the area!

They are in major need of security-Problems: kids running in hall at 10:30 at night, teens/20somethings drinking beer and eating pizza sitting in side walk outside lobby entrance, skateboarders all over parking lot at all hours, Bum hanging around smoking area, Broken A/C on 3rd floor, Ice...

By the time she left, we had a really great of idea of what we wanted for our wedding invitations. Her... Read More relationships with multiple stationers allowed us to get our Letterpress invitations for almost a third of what we were quoted at other stationary vendors. Once the proof review started, Kristen was on our side as we had to work through a few design issues with our vendor. Kristen made sure we got exactly what we wanted despite having to go through four revisions to get the design just right. Our invitations turned out perfectly. We were getting emails and texts after they all went out saying they were the most original and prettiest invitations they had ever received. Thanks Silver Starfish for setting the stage for the rest of our wedding.
1	Great Hotel. Super friendly and accommodating staff. Staff bent over backwards to assure we had a great stay. Always ice cold water, news papers and vacation information in the lobby. Great restaurant recommendations. We ubered from the airport 33-55 . You do not need a car in the city. Street car on one side of hotel. 2 blocks to French quarter and bourbon street. Near casino and ww2 museum. Beds super comfortable and hotel is really clean. Thank you for your recent stay with us at the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans! We greatly appreciate your kind words and look forward to hosting you again soon. If we can be of further assistance, please don't hesitate to contact us directly. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
1	Good Value. Stayed 3 nights in a 2 room suite (we were a party of 3 adults). The location was very convenient. The French Quarter was a short walk and the area was very safe. Close to the trolley and the WWII Museum. The suite was large, but the bedroom had no window and the window in the other room had no view. The sofa bed did not pull out easily, so my son just slept on the sofa which he was ok with. It was nice having the extra space privacy with 2 rooms and the price was right. The complimentary breakfast was nice. We didn't make much use of the evening social hour because who wants to eat hot dogs chips when there is such great food in New Orleans, but if you are a family economizing you could easily make a meal out of it. It looked like the hotel does a lot of tour business.
1	Great Location, Great Value. We stayed 4 nights and had a corner room. Its across the street from City Center and the Space Needle. Hop on the Monorail and you are downtown, a short walk to Pikes Place Market. Its hard to find nice rooms in Seattle for under 200 a night, which is what we paid, including taxes and parking. Oh, and did I say breakfast was included.Dear Gary S,Thank you for completing our Guest Survey regarding your recent stay at our hotel. Please know that your feedback is extremely valuable to us and we will utilize your response to make every guest experience the best it can be. I am glad to hear that you found our location to be great and our hotel to be a great value! I greatly appreciate your 5 star review it will be celebrated with the hotel. If I can be of any assistance to you, please contact me directly. We appreciate your business!! Sincerely,Jonathan
1	Good hotel but noisy. Good hotel, really good bed.Hotel is doing work to renew it.Parking is a little small and you are close to the road, so expect to be wake up early.But if are visiting San Francisco it might not be a bad thing.Reception is a little awkward when the hotel is doing the work, its in a room, so you are not sure if its a reception or if its someone room.Thank you for your review. We appreciate your understanding whilst we are finishing our renovations, and we hope that you will return when everything is finished, so that you can experience our wonderful, fresh product. We really hope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you back! Best wishes, Hotel Management
0	She's been ridden pretty hard. Don't understand what others are saying when they say the rooms are spacious. I stayed in two of them, begged for a larger room, and was told they don't exist. These are very small rooms. The best benefits to this hotel are that it is indeed very well located and the company that owns it is a great group. But, here is what I kept thinking during my recent stay:The old mare has been ridden hard and put to bed wet. Joie de Vivre has put a 1,000 saddle on a 5 horse. Some paint (celedon), some fun art (mostly drawings and sketches) and cleaned her up a bit. But the trim is beat to hell, floor covering isn't secure in places, window air conditioners, dark rooms. If you like Joie de Vivre hotels as I do, let's encourage them to rehab the Galleria Park Hotel. She deserves it.
1	Good location beautiful hotel. This is my first stay in Chicago. the location was within walking distance to most things I wanted to visit. The front desk staff is great and willing to answer any questions. We were on the 19th floor and our room was very quiet. The rooms are on the small side but I expect that in most large cities. I loved being able to take out the bikes to explore the city. Become a Kimpton rewards member as it comes with many perks.Glad we nailed it and we look forward to seeing you again soon!Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager
1	They win with service. My husband, 4 year old, and I stayed at the Hotel Abri from Oct 11-14, 2012. The staff at this hotel were beyond 5 star with their service. They were helpful, honest, and really went out of their way to make sure you had what you needed. My daughter was taken with Tyler at the front, in particular! Aside from the service, the boutique hotel was fine. We had an urban suite, which had ample room. The two window units kept the place cool, and the curtains kept out enough light. My only complaint, and I mean ONLY complaint, was that the bathroom door was a sliding door, did not lock, and was frosted glass. If you have kids, you know that sometimes your only solitude can come from the few moments you get in the bathroom. My daughter had a grand time putting her face up to the glass and letting us know she was well aware we were in there, and I am thankful she never realized she could actually open the door. My husband would probably say that he didn't care for the fact that sometimes during the day you could smell Subway from downstairs in our room (on the 2nd floor), but we weren't in there much, and it was minor. The hotel was very convenient to the cable car that took you to the Wharf, as well as the BART and other public transport. There was AMPLE shopping in the area too. All in all, I'd recommend this hotel, mainly to people traveling without small kids. LOL
1	delicious snack before the evening play. I stayed at Ritz-Carlton Hotel during my last visit.However, St. Regis is located right on the 5th avenue where I dropped by twice.Once for a afternoon tea at Astor Court, after a long busy day. Varieties of sandwiches and scones were nicely served, just like they do at Ritz, London, I skipped dinner on that evening.The next evening I dropped by to have light snack before evening play. The club sandwich was a simple menu but the most delicious I have had. The over all service is excellent.I would definitely stay at this hotel if it situated near the Central Park, like Ritz-Carlton.Dear spaniel12, On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we thank you for sharing the details of your recent visit to Astor Court on TripAdvisor.At The St. Regis New York, we pride ourselves on our personalized service, and we are so glad that you were able to experience this first hand.Please let us know when you will be returning to New York, as we would love to welcome you back as our guest.Sincerely,Octavia MargineanHotel Manager
1	I didn't have any issues, and the bed is amazing. I stayed here for one night with my wife and two little kids. We were given a corner room with two queen beds which provided more than enough space for us. We were able to fit the toddler bed into the bathroom like we usually do. I chose this place in spite of the 15 parking fee, no free breakfast, and close proximity to a strip club (as mentioned in prior reviews). The room was clean and spacious. The highlight for me was the amazing bed and pillows. I stay at many different hotels and if this is the standard for Four Points I am very impressed. We also ate at the Denny's right across the street and went to Sea World the next morning refreshed and ready.
1	Trendy and Hip. Very nicely decorated in retro fashion. Loved the steamer versus the traditional iron.Very friendly and accommodating staff.Although location is within walking distance to the French Quarter, would not recommend walking late at night. We found ourselves a bit turnaround when walking back from French Quarter. We stopped in at the Emergency Department of Tulane Hospital for directions who advised us that it was not safe to be walking in this area. They called us a cab despite the fare being very short (a few blocks). Thank you for taking a few minutes to share your experience. The comments of our guests are important for others to get a feel of our property and location. Sorry to hear you got turned around, be sure to let our concierge assist you with a map on your next visit.WayneGeneral Manager
0	Rooms not worth the price location is great. I do realize Bourbon st a bit noisy, Hotel noisy as well as Bourbon st. with all the construction loud jack hammering. Server (Hope) had entirely to much hair!!! serving food with no hair net or hat on all servers should require hair nets for safety Dear Lisa M,While we are pleased to hear you enjoyed our location, we regret you did not fully enjoy your experience. We try our best to minimize noise from both inside and outside our hotel, and we apologize you were not able to enjoy your experience due to the noise level. Rest assured, your comments in regard to noise and our restaurant servers have been addressed and properly handled. Thank you for your feedback. All the best
1	Great place to stay. I was a little tentative to come here because we usually stay at another hotel we really like. We were picking our daughter up from college and this hotel was just what we needed. The room and hotel was clean and it was quiet. The breakfast was good. I would recommend gettng some sugar free syrup.I have to say, I love the staff at this hotel. They are REALLY nice people. Steven at the front desk is very nice and I can't say enough about Brian Knopp. We were moving our daughter out of the dorm and she had extra activities she was involved with and it was leaving us with little time and we didn't know how we were going to manage it. In talking we Steve, he said he could give us an extra hour at check out , but not only that, they let us come back later in the day to freshen up before an event we had to go to. I had asked to use the public bathroom, but Brian wouldn't have that and let use a vacant room. We only needed it for about 30 minutes, so it worked out perfectly. We were so grateful for the hospitality they provided.I would come back to this hotel in a heart beat.We very much appreciate and value your feedback and will share it with our team. Your survey responses will serve as encouragement to all of our staff as we strive to continuously improve the quality of our services to provide an exceptional experience for our guests. It is always a pleasure to receive positive feedback.Thank you again for sharing your experience, and we look forward to your next visit!Safe Travels,Brian Knopp, General ManagerCOMFORT INN SUITES - LynchburgA New Level of Comfort!
1	Comfy and convenient. Hyatt Place was in a great location. Tons of restaurants nearby and short walking distance to the harbor. The rooms were so neat and clean and so comfortable. I really enjoyed it. The only downfall was parking. The hotel doesn't have its own parking garage. They do have Valet parking but it was too expensive. Good thing there was a municipal parking garage right behind the hotel that was cheap because there wasn't a lot of street parking nearby. We ended up taking ubers to other locations that were longer distances so we didn't have to go in and out of the parking garage and pay each time.
1	A wonderful stay. Great room and great service.. My wife and I took a long weekend trip to San Francisco to celebrate our 10th anniversary. By random chance it was Fleet Week so everything was full and busy. Even with the crowds and a Democratic National Committee fundraiser in the building, the staff made us feel welcome and special. The breakfast at the restaurant on the 4th() floor was impeccable as well.Dear Scott M,Thank you for taking the time to share your review of your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco. We are honored that you chose our hotel to celebrate your anniversary, and pleased to hear that you had an exceptional experience. Please do not hesitate to contact me directly prior to your next visit to San Francisco as we hope to welcome you and your wife back soon.Sincerely, Anthony Duggan Hotel Manager 415-284-4057 anthony.dugganstregis.com
1	Nice Property. This is a pretty new property that is conveniently located to Seaworld, downtown, and La Jolla. Staff was mostly polite, especially the breakfast staff. The room was clean. I liked the shower enclosure in the bathroom and the electronics charging station on the nightstand. The mattress was a bit firm for my taste. The only thing missing is a microwave in the room. Parking is 16/day, which is questionable. Breakfast was adequate--continental-type items, plus waffles, oatmeal, breakfast potatoes, eggs.Good Afternoon pe556ai,Thank you for your five star review, we are glad you had an excellent stay! We were thrilled to read that you enjoyed our central location, amenities, and your interactions with our team. Thank you for noting your preference for a microwave in the room. We understand the convenience this provides and do have some available for a nominal fee per night. On your next stay with us, we would be happy to note that preference to ensure your complete comfort. Thank you again for staying with us it was a privilege to have you as our guest.Warm Regards,Nathan S.Operations Manager
1	Great Option. What a pleasant surprise. I stayed in this hotel because I was attending a conference. The rooms are greatand I am picky. The bathroom was nice with granite/marble (who can tell the difference anymore). Bed was great. Nice size room. Really nothing negative to say. I am typically a boutique hotel kind of guy for vacation, but if you are looking for a nice hotel in downtown Seattle, this is not a bad option. I stayed at the W before I moved to this hotel. I liked this hotel better than the W. Quite a statement coming from someone who has stayed at several W hotels around the world and recommend them. If the rate is decent, consider this option. It is typically that big hotel feel, but worth the stay.
1	Worth using. Very good stay and excellent value for money. Friendly staff and quiet rooms (though no view) it was a great base and one I'd be tempted to use again. It's central Ian big US city so yes they're small but otherwise very good. Staff lovely and location excellent - worth wandering up Hyde or Polk to union for some lovely SF fun. Only downside was that they don't have a car park but they have a good deal with the secure public lot at 840 Sutter - just 200m away.Dear Matt W,Thank you very much for your review of our hotel. I am thrilled to hear that you enjoyed your stay and wanted to let you know how much we appreciate your taking the time to share your experience on Trip Advisor. We look forward to welcoming you back as our guest on a future visit into San Francisco!Best regards,Nick DalisayArea Director of SalesHaiyi Hotels Worldwide
1	Rough Start Turned To Diamond Experience!. This property is extremely close to all the Disney Parks and main Marriott hotel (on property). Location, Location, Location. The overall property is very good and the staff is outstanding. Unfortunately our initial experience was very rough but the property management took accountability, immediately fixed the issues and followed up repeatedly to ensure our satisfaction. My family checked into the three bedroom villa on December 26th for seven days at Disney World. The overall layout of the room is excelled and we enjoyed the screened in porch overlooking the golf course and pond (ducks included). Upon arriving, the villa floors were filthy, carpets stained and bar stools worn to threadbare state. We've stayed at many Marriott Vacation Club properties over the years and experienced beautiful, clean and new(er) villas. The cleanliness of our villa was out of the ordinary. I called the GM, Eugene, and he immediately brought his staff to our villa to assess the situation and offer apologies. He committed to having all fixed by the time we returned from Magic Kingdom later that day. Eugene and team came through with grace and excellence. The room was deep cleaned, carpets shampooed and furniture replaced with brand new pieces. The Vacation Club staff treated me and my family like Diamond status owners the rest of the week. Eugene and his team turned a situation into an experience we will never forget. Well done!Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We apologize for any inconvenience you experienced upon arrival but it is great to hear Eugene and staff were able to resolve the issue swiftly and to your satisfaction. We hope you will join us again sometime soon.
0	Poor Communication, Great Location. I wish we could have given more stars but the lack of communication and the promises made to me by the staff is where the stars come off. We booked our reservations weeks out and requested the bottom floor because we have two under two. This hotel has NO ELEVATOR, which we knew about hence the request. We have a double stroller and after a long day at the parks we did not want to carry both babies upstairs and come back for the double stroller. When we called the morning of we spoke to Nenetzen (sp), requested a crib and wanted to make sure they would be able to honor our first level request and also let them know we would be checking in late, we were told the crib would be in our room (it was) and we would get the first level. I also called 30 minutes before arrival to also confirm that the crib was in the room and that we were on the first floor, I was also given a confirmation on both. We checked in around 1120pm and they are unable to accommodate our first floor request. I could understand if I hadn't already spoken to TWO people the day of checkin but I SPOKE TO SOMEONE 30 minutes ago. Apparently shift change happens at 11pm and we got to load both babies upstairs. I was told to call back in the morning to see if we could switch rooms, I did, and the morning person wasn't in yet to speak with and was told they would call me back.... no one ever followed up. This was very disappointing and made us not want to return back to the room for our midday nap as it was a huge inconvenience. Pros- rooms were clean, hot water and seemed to be remodeled recently. Location. Nice size rooms, it was deeper than your usual standard rooms that have the traditional narrow walkway in between the Tv and the beds, it was nice to not have to move the cribs to walk around.Cons- continental breakfast we skipped after looking at the selections, mostly donuts. Beds were very uncomfortable and the queen beds seemed more like doubles. The cribs were on the smaller side, I had called twice to ask about their size and couldn't get a clear answer so anyone else wondering they are the metal smaller cribs, close to a mini crib and smaller than a pack n play. My 22 month old could not fit in it but my 12 month old fit fine, I would say max 18 month age. There are no curtains, just shutters, so the lights that light the property will shine all night long, hard to sleep if you're used to sleeping in a dark room.We are annual passholders and will chose a different location next time.
1	Great stay at a great price. This place was great. The room was clean and tidy. The bed/pillows were comfortable. The breakfast was one of the better I have had, the inclusion of croissants and french toast sticks made it better than most hotels I've stayed in. The staff was friendly and helpful. There is a good sized refrigerator in the room and the pool looked nice (too bad it was raining.) The location is close to a wide variety of restaurants and the UCF campus. The only drawbacks I found was that the WiFi could be improved and the room could use a microwave, there is a microwave in the lobby but I prefer the convenience of one in the room.,Thank you for leaving your feedback regarding your most recent stay with us. We're glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay at our property. It's great to hear that you enjoyed your room as well as breakfast. We are currently looking into the concerns you brought up in this review, thank you for bringing them to my attention. We hope that we will have the pleasure of seeing you again in the future.
0	Dissapointed in Management. Several of our family members stayed there. We were leaving on a cruise from Seward the next day. Rooms were spacious but dated, and shuttle service from/to the airport was offered. Upon check-out the next day , we noticed that the charge was different than confirmed and e-mailed to us by manager RG. Even after discussing the discrepancy with him... More
0	Close tot he airport, but pretty poor condition. Very worm out room, close to the airport, but the smell in the room was unpleasant
1	Areal gem in the right place. Excellent rooms, excellent service, nice people, great location, Parking is cheap for SF with in and out privileges. Beautiful public places, fine breakfast. 50 feet from China town, 5 blocks from the north end, three blocks from Union Square, not far from museums and Mosconi center. Powell Street cable car to Fisherman's Wharf is 3 blocks. It doesn't get any better than this.Thank you Bruce G for a fantastic review!We truly appreciate your comment of being a real gem and that it doesn't get any better than this which is what we aim to be.Looking forward to welcoming you back soon, Pablo B. General Manager
0	Previous Guests Garbage in My Closet- Really?. Comfortable bed for the night. My first impression was quite good for the price. Then I opened the closet door and discovered the garbage from a previous guest (ancient pizza in box, used plates, used napkins) stacked inside. Looked like it had been there a long, long time. It's amazing how fast your impression of a place can change. Wish the person at the desk had been a little more concerned about it when I told her. I did not leave with a great impression of the place.
0	Good location - overpriced as it is old.... Great service, awesome breakfast Poor, old building, elevator was not working for a 5 floor building!!!!
0	Noisy and unprofessional. The hotel looks good, and I don't know if things have gotten bad lately, but when we stayed there it was noisy as heck and the place is run by kids. We stayed AT FIRST (but not for long) on the first floor. Whatever was going on above us sounded like a wrestling match. It was there when we checked... More
0	Hampton Inn. heat in room did not work properly, tv remote was broken excessive noise
0	Beyond Terrible. The hotel itself is absolutely below reasonable standards and resembled Bates Motel or something of that sorts. The assistant manager is unprofessional and has no problem manipulating customers for a buck. I looked at reviews prior to visiting the hotel and thought that the negative reviews were merely bitter customers who wanted to rant. I WAS WRONG, this displeasure was absolutely warranted. The poor service motivated me to begin writing reviews so that future customers can be spared from this experience. If you can afford to go elsewhere, by all means GO ELSEWHERE!
0	The Most Disgusting Motel!!!!!. The Dayton Motel and Blue Mountain Motel are owned by the same family. They are 2 of the most disgusting places to stay. I checked into our room Friday and the first thing I did was ask for it to be cleaned again. Dirty pillow case, curly hairs in the sheets, dirt and dust everywhere. The family that bought this... More
0	This is a motel. This is a motel, rather than a hotel. Bad rooms, bad breakfast, bad smell throughout the whole 3. floor. Not good.Thank you for taking the time to review our property. Your comments are valued. Management has been given your feedback to review and address. Thank you for your stay.
1	Antiquated but Adorable. The Pacific View Inn is in a wonderful location. It was lovely waking up to the sound of the ocean every morning. It is close to a plethora of restaurants and shopping. The only critique I have for the Inn is it is a bit out of date. It has a very 60's feel. I know it doesn't have AC but it wasn't an issue for me in December. They did provide a space heater which worked perfectly. The staff is amazing and friendly. All in all, I would recommend the Inn and I look forward to visiting again in the near future.Thank you for the great review! We are indeed outdated. The good news is, we plan to fully renovate the property this year. Hope to have you back afterward so that we can impress you. Don't forget to book direct so that we can extend the best rate possible. -Neil
0	Needs to train staff in customer service. We arrived at this hotel a little early for check in so we went to get some essentials from the supermarket. We arrived back at the hotel for the 4 pm check in to be told it would be another 30 minutes before they had a room for us. When you state that's it's a 4 pm check in you have the rooms ready for 4 pm not 4.15 or 4.30. This shows me how much they regard their customers/guests.The room was clean and tidy but we had booked a deluxe room and we were not happy to see an adjoining door to the next room as we have experienced these before when we hear everything from the next room and I expect they hear everything from our room. If they want to cut energy costs then move the table away from the front of the a/c unit and let it work properly and don't mess about turning fridges off as they will run for longer to get cold again. Found the noise to be rather overbearing at times with guests stomping along the walkways and slamming doors at all hours if the night. Housekeeping seems to be scarce on the ground at this hotel at times. If we are in San Diego again I doubt we will pick this hotel again. It seems that Best Western has a special training course for front desk staff in how to be rude and unhelpful and to treat the guest as an problem rather than the reason for them having a job as this is the second Best Western we have encountered this poor service from front desk staff. All in I would not and could not recommend this hotel to anyone.
1	Beautiful hotel, great location skimped on room amenities. I stayed at the Grand Hyatt, Seattle Tuesday through Saturday with my wife. The hotel is beautiful, trendy with very good service. It is just across from the convention center and has a Ruths Chris (that even serves breakfast), a Starbucks, NY-style deli, and Blue C Sushi attached. A Cheesecake factory is on the corner of the building but not attached to the Hyatt.The doorman, valets, bellman (especially Jazz), front desk and maids were all very good. We chose a club room which served a decent breakfast but seemed to skimp on the variety of food items for the evening appetizer drink session. The club room did have very nice computer stations, TVs, chairs and couches, and a fantastic view.The room was certainly large enough with a very comfortable king-size bed. What disappointed my wife and me was that the desk (i.e. the place to put your computer, cell phone, etc.) only had one available wall plug, hidden and inconveniently located behind the desk. Most hotel desks have lamps with electrical outlets in their bases, or several outlets purpose-built into the desk. Not so with our desk just a plain desk and one hidden plug. Also, only every third or fourth floor had an ice machine. When I needed ice (which was daily so my wife could ice her post-op foot) I had to go from the my 25th floor room to the 28th floor - or call for ice and wait.They also only provided two glasses for the room and no paper/plastic cups. We prefer to use two glasses for drinks and have two in the BR. When we would bring glasses down from the club to put on the bathroom counter, they were consistently gone in the morning. Moreover, the towels were remarkably thin and limp, not what youd expect from a high-end hotel and they only provided two hand towels and two not-so-large bath towels. (The towels at the Staybridge Inn and Hampton Inns where we also stayed on our trip were much larger and more plush and each gave us four of each.)We were surprised and disappointed that Hyatt would cut corners on the Club food, towels, and a decent computer desk. Otherwise, we had a nice stay and would consider staying there again.
0	Nit impressed with the Quality of this Inn. After spending 10 hours in the car we stopped here. Outside hotel needs serious work unless you like wasps and spiders. Exit sign hanging by wires from 2nd floor ceiling. Pool had floating dirt and was extremely cloudy wouldnt let kids swim. Rooms are very old but at least it was sortof clean. The pictures look a lot less murdery... More
0	Worth 65 for Single queen. Room was super clean, bed was great. Now the not so great stuff. Bathroom was like the inside of a cave. One weak light, barely enough to see what you're doing. Shower needs to be redone as floor was badly chipped and looked super bad....More
1	Loved everything about this hotel! Especially the staff.. As a lifetime Diamond member, I have stayed at many Hilton Properties. Several within New Orleans. The decor is contemporary and colorful. Rooms are spacious and well kept. The best part of my stay was the staff. Carl was especially helpful and made our stay easier. i will definitely be back.Thank you for taking the time to write this excellent review and for choosing our hotel as your place to stay during this recent trip to New Orleans. It sounds like our property and service provided exceeded all expectations which is our ultimate goal with all of our guests. Carl will be commended for his efforts in going above and beyond to ensure you were well taken care of and we look forward to having you back as our guest very soon.Best regards,
1	You get a lot for your bucks. They've made a nice job transforming an old motel into this cool, well-designed hotel, with a very attractive bar-restaurant-pool area and rooms that are clean, pretty and comfortable. Felt a bit sorry for the lonely fish in its bowl though, it seemed half-dead.The location is by a main road but noise didn't bother and it's actually very central a stone's throw from the airport and not far from neither Downtown nor SeaWorld.Also, it's not at all expensive.Greatly appreciate you review and kind comments about the Pearl Hotel. Honored to have you as our guest.

0	Typical side of the highway motel. We stopped here the night before Thanksgiving to rest before going to celebrate the holiday with family in Deshler. The woman who checked us in late Wednesday night was very friendly and helpful. The rooms were typical of those you see on the side of the highway. We slept in on Thanksgiving and did get a late start however, we... More
0	Wouldn't stay again. Staff was pleasant. Breakfast was a little better than average. They had waffles, eggs,sausage, fruit and the usual pastries. Our room was old, smelled of cigarette smoke. Water damage, loose fixtures in the bathroom. Was supposed to stay 4 nights but found better accommodations after 2.

Check-in - bad (long lines) Room - bad (had to be moved), Housekeeping - disgusting (maid used washcloths and a spray bottle of 'whatever' to 'clean' everything - including glasses, mirror, desks, bath floors Food - lackluster Banquet Service - horrible...

1	Quick overnight stay.. My sister I were only in town for a day so we didn't need a lot of service when we were at the hotel. However, it did meet our requirements. The room was very clean, the woman at the front desk was polite professional when we checked in. We were very pleased with our short little stay. All we every ask is that the rooms are clean, the staff is respectful, it to be quiet. I will say that there were a lot of children. I don't know if this hotel is a vacation destination hotel because the amount of children was a little daunting. Granted, it is summer they do have a pool. The halls were still fairly quiet while we were on our way to check out, the room next to ours had a bunch of children in it we never had a problem with the noise level so I think it's safe to say the walls are pretty thick.
1	Wonderful New Hotel - Stay Here!. We recently spent three nights at The NOPSI in New Orleans. Nothing but good things to say. Beautiful first impression - absolutely gorgeous lobby! Extremely friendly and helpful staff - from the doormen, the front desk folks, the concierge - everyone! The location was an easy walk to the French Quarter but far enough away from the not so nice part. And the rooms were great - spotless, comfortable and large. Nice bars in the lobby and on the roof and also in the adjacent restaurant (which had a very good breakfast). All in all, A+!Frank, Thank you for visiting NOPSI Hotel. Our service professionals strive to make our guests feel at home from the moment they walk through the doors. We are honored that our service has earned your recommendation and look forward to welcoming you back in the near future. Warm regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager

We stayed there for 4 nights and we were very happy of the choiceRoom was nice and clean and service was very goodFree parking provided which was important to usOn Lombard street in the front of the hotel there is a stop of the Big Bus Company which allows an easy way to start city toursThe hotel is at a walking distance from Fisherman wharf and public transportation is available including famous cable carOne disadvantage is breakfast and breakfast room locationThe room is to small for all people having breakfast at the same timeThe only pastries served are sweet and I would to suggest adding some non sweet stuf

1	Excellent hotel and convinient. I stayed for 3 nights with my family. We enjoyed it. It is in a good location, actually not far from both crystal city and Pentogan city stations. However, we need to walk about 200 m to get to metro station of crystal city. This is a fine distance to walk. It is very quite and clean. Breakfast is excellent. The resturant also provide good grills. The stay is almost half or less than half price of Embassy suite in downtown, but it is only 15 min by metro from downtwon, and 1 stop by metro from the airport. It is an absolute great chioce to stay there.
0	Great location, but that was it.. The staff was excellent and friendly. The building needs a complete electrical and plumbing upgrade. There was inadequate water pressure and the bathtub leaked all over the floor when I pulled the plug. I had to bale out the tub with a trash can.The tiles were all cracked and need replaced.The electrical outlets were sketchy and I had to ask for a power bar.We paid for vip parking at 30 a night. When we came back Sat. night there was no parking so we had to park in a no parking spot. They did refund 1 day of parking but it hasn't shown on my card yet.
1	Great stay!. I stayed here for 3 nights with a friend last weekend. I booked this hotel as part of a package through Expedia. I checked out the reviews here on TripAdvisor before booking and I was a little nervous about the small size of the rooms and the shared bathrooms, but Expedia made me an offer I couldn't refuse so I went for it. Pros:- Terrific location- Great price (considering the area)- Clean and decently comfortable rooms- Clean bathrooms- I loved the character of this hotel and the vintage details. And despite its vintage-ness, it's still kept up and pretty well-maintained. Very charming and quaint. A great alternative to the standard chain hotels. - Friendly staff- The wifi is free, signal strength was so-so though- Nice quiet neighborhood, and the hotel guests are quiet for the most part- Lovely restaurant on the ground floor, also quiet (I never heard any noise from the restaurant while in our room).Cons:- Rooms are very small, I'd say our room was 8 x 8 ft, max. - Beds aren't that comfortable...not unbearably so, but ours had definitely seen many years of use so the mattress was caving in a little.- No A/C. There are ceiling fans though, which helps with the ventilation (it can get stuffy in those rooms). But our ceiling fan was a little worn out so it made loud creaking noises, couldn't really have it on at night.The pros definitely outweighed the cons in my opinion. I'd definitely stay here again and I'd recommend it to anyone who is traveling alone, with a partner or with a friend or two. Don't think I'd recommend it to families, particularly those traveling with small children or babies.Hi Amanda J, sorry it's taken so long to thank you for your intelligent point by point review, listing the pros and cons of staying in our historic hostelry. It must be the holidaze but where-ever you go, there your are, or something like that said better by Tich Nat Han or was it Echard Tolle or maybe Georg Feurstein. We tightened up the loose fan and are replacing our mattresses this off season, a truck full of them just arrived yesterday. We love intelligent people like yourself who do a little research before choosing us. They are rewarded by one of the best values in town and a unique travel experience. We like to think of our inn as an opportunity to stay in a bit of living history, surrounded by art and artifacts from a bygone era of clipper ships, that set a record from NY to SFO in a mere 92 days. The three masted schooner Balcutha is berthed a few blocks away at the Hyde Street Historic Pier a national monument, along with other historic vessels that plied the seas and the bay like a ferry boat with vintage cars on it.So have a great New Year and hurry back, they just reopened the GG Bridge after installing a new movable barrier on it and the new approaches to it are coming along with the new tunnels. This innkeeper has to go remove the Christmas tree now, check the drains in our shared showers and replenish the heated towel racks. Cheers,P.S. Catch the new flick BIG EYES with Amy Adams playing the artist Margaret Keene. Nine of our hotel's car collection are featured in it, look for our red '55 T-Bird, Much of the movie was shot in our neighborhood. Her original gallery was upstairs on Broadway near Enricos and she has a new gallery near the Wharf, that's open on occasion. If there are any car guys or gals, ask for a tour of our 1917 stable next door to see some of our vintage vehicles and some of our later faster track cars.
1	So happy with our choice - Great Location, Great Service, Great Stay. My husband and I stayed at the St. Regis for six nights while visiting San Francisco. I spent a great deal of time selecting the hotel for this trip. After researching and considering many hotels, I chose the St. Regis. I was very happy with my choice. The location was great - it was close enough to every place we wanted to visit, without being in the middle of too much of the touristy crowd. Although our room didn't have the floor to ceiling windows I was expecting, it was nicely equipped and well maintained. I can overlook my disappointment over the absence of a panoramic view because of the amazing service. From the time we made our reservations to the time we left the hotel, the service was attentive and thoughtful, without being obtrusive. The concierge and guest relations people helped us with our wine tour, ferry and restaurant plans. The people at the front desk and in the lobby greeted us by name. Those at the restaurant, the Vitrine, were particularly kind and thoughtful. Kane was our server on most mornings. When he found out it was my birthday, he brought me a special breakfast dessert. To celebrate our anniversary, he brought us champagne and chocolate. The service made it truly a memorable stay. I'm sure that the service at the St. Regis will become the standard by which we will measure other hotels.Dear Kingtrips,Thank you for taking the time to share your review of your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco. I pleased to hear that you and your husband had an exceptional experience and I sincerely appreciate your kind words regarding our service and your high recommendation of our hotel. Please do not hesitate to contact me directly prior to your next visit to San Francisco, as we hope to welcome back to the best address soon.Sincerely,Anthony DugganHotel Manager415-284-4057anthony.dugganstregis.com
1	Fabulous Location outside ChinaTown entrance. What a great boutique hotel, just outside the entrance to ChinaTown. Just can't beat the location, which is walking distance to everything. Really nice rooms and service. No realy separate bar area, and I didn't eat there. But, you can walk everywhere from here, so no matter. Recommend the rooms and location.Thank you for the great review. I am so pleased to read that you stay was a good one. I could not agree more about the location. Many points of interest are an easy walk from the hotel. The others are a simple bus or cable car ride away. We truly appreciate you sharing your experience and recommending our hotel. CheersQuinn McEnteeFront Office Manager
0	Probably won't return. Room/hotel was not in great condition. Housekeeping left a note on first morning saying they had not cleaned the room because they were protecting our privacy - and we did not have a DND sign out, nor were we in our room late. Free WiFi was only free because it never worked. Breakfast food wasn't refilled - and there was still 30 min remaining.
0	Very shabby, not very chic. I expect VERY little from a hotel. I'm cheap by nature, and I really only want a door that locks and a shower that's hot. However, Hotel 502 made me rethink my low expectations and future travel plans. The front desk clerks ARE friendly and responsive, BUT, the rooms are very shabby and barely clean ('down there' hair on toilet seat, permanent mystery stain on sheets), the shower was cold/lukewarm (at best) and the neighborhood is less than desirable--LOTS of transients and sketchy folks wandering on property. I only paid 62 (+tax) per night, but if I had paid more I would have been really angry. As I said earlier, I really only want a locking door and hot shower (for 60+ I don't expect much). I can overlook the worn down rooms (I was told our room was renovated, but my mother stayed here when it was formally the Red Roof Inn, and said it looked the same, save a new t.v., and a different paint color on the bathroom wall). I can overlook the fact that a storm knocked out their WiFi and the pool was closed. I can overlook the people passed out drunk in their cars, and the less than clean room/bath. But NO hot shower Not good--even for 62 and some change. The only plus was the friendly front desk clerk--she gets kudos.
0	Expected more. The people were friendly but didnt have any rooms cleaned til 1 1/2 hours after check in pool was gross not sure it was cleaned this year and certainly was not like the photos they show on web site,and if you were to use pool they only have hair towels to dry off
1	Great boutique hotel!. I had a quick weekend in Phoenix due to a family emergency and this hotel couldn't have been a more perfect reprieve from the chaos of the circumstances that led to the trip. The hotel staff was excellent, extremely friendly and social with guests. The lobby and decor was really cool with art everywhere. Bar was lovely with fun, inventive drinks and a lively, but not obnoxious atmosphere. Room was very spacious with great amenities, though some options in the mini bar would be nice. Bed was great as was the shower. I had a balcony that looked over the pool area. Great little couch to sit on outside. I have stayed in a couple of Ace hotels and I would say this hotel has that feel, but done much better. For the reasonable price this hotel is wonderful! Thanks Found:re for bringing some light to a crap weekend : ).Wow! Thank you so much for the wonderful review. We're so happy to hear you had a great stay. We can't wait to have you back. Sorry you had a crap weekend. Glad we could help make it better.
1	Convenience and Quality Add Up To Great Stay!. The Westin is exemplary for its customer-oriented service, convenience to San Diego's major attractions, and amenities. In this case, I was attending a conference (for which, by the way, the Westin is extremely well endowed), but would have no reservations about making reservations for an extended vacation stay. Equidistant from the Gaslamp District or the Harbor, the hotel offers a welcome atmosphere for a relaxing getaway.HerbPaine - I am so pleased you enjoyed your entire experience at the Westin San Diego. Thank you for recognizing the teams exemplary customer service. We look forward to welcoming you back to sunny San Diego.Remain Well, Alyssa TurowskiGeneral Manager
0	Not worth the humiliation. If you book make sure you tell them you have an anniversary to get good treatment.... We had booked 3 rooms and only one room with an anniversary received better service. And expect to be called a liar in so many words if something happens there you want an explanation for. I was in tears. Don't believe valet if they tell you no parking fee for guests on registry. I paid too much for the headache I got...I didn't deserve thatHi! I'm so sorry to hear you had a less than amazing experience staying with us. I would love to follow up and get some more detail from you on your stay. Could you please provide the best contact info, name, and date of stay We'd like to do all we can to rectify the situation. Please send info to jvaldezfoundrehotels.com. We do hope you will give us another try.
0	Did not Recieve Room I paid for. I booked a Superior room. Upon check in I requested a room down stairs due to my inability to climb stairs. Was informed there were none. Then she said wait a minute I have the handy cap room, I asked if was a superior room and was told it was. The room was not a SUPIOR room. I paid for supior.
0	Had a bed but not again!. Stayed hare for a night as all else was full. Staff was friendly and easy check in. Breakfast was very disappointing. Little choice and not fresh. The room to the front was noisy and not clean. Bath room was part of room which made the room damp! Wifi and access to highway easy. Parking ok.
1	Comfortable place excellent location. This Marriott was selected for me as part of our partner meeting. After flying in from Miami, having a shuttle to get us to the hotel was a nice touch. Although some complained that it took too long for the shuttle to arrive and get them to the hotel. That was not my experience. Within five minutes of arriving at the shuttle stop, we were on our way with a very friendly and polite shuttle driver named Joseph. Upon arrival, and before checking in I had an excellent meal at the Brickton Grill located in the lobby with my partners. Upon checking in, I found a room that's a bit on the small size but definitely functional, clean, and comfortable. There were plenty of outlets to charge my electronic devices, plenty of drawer space and closet space to unpack, and the desk was perfect for work. The workstation and office chair important to me and my business travels. I thought that the Matt did a great job with the room. The bed was very comfortable. I will also note that the service on all levels was very good. The location in Rosemont not very far from the airport makes this an excellent place to stay on business if you don't need to be in downtown Chicago.Dear Maltafaz: Thank you very much for writing a review of visit with us. I glad that you enjoyed your stay as well as your dining experience in Brickton and Brickton Bar. We look forward to your next stay! Wishing you safe travels, Dieter Heigl
1	Great Stay. We stayed at the Bienville House Hotel with friends at the beginning of October. We found it to be a lovely boutique hotel. Our room had a king size four poster bed. Quite honestly the bed could use a new mattress but we were so busy during the day we were exhausted at night and slept just fine. The staff were VERY helpful and friendly. The continental breakfast was certainly adequate and fresh and the coffee was great. Yes, the pool is small and not much sun gets on it, but I didn't goto New Orleans to swim or I would have picked another hotel. My first visit to New Orleans was fantastic.
0	Unsafe stay. Not happy because when I got there this was like the umpteenth time that I made a reservation through Hotels.com and not get what I reserved!!!. Makes me want to never use Hotels.com again. The room was run down, snags in the carpet, snags in the towels and sheets. And what made it worse was the side door stayed unlocked all night, drug activity in the parking lot, and there were no cameras in the stairwell from the side door....anybody could have come into the hotel and no one would see it. Very unpleasant stay and unsafe. Will not stay there ever again.
0	Disaster. First look at the hotel it seems nice, but don't let the 4 bubble review fool you. When we check in they had up-charged the rate from 129 to 152 a night. They overcharged one party 3 times and then charged our card for one night instead of two. They also didn't add the military discount that was suppose to... More
1	Perfect Hotel in a Perfect Location. We hadn't stayed at the St. Regis for many years. We decided to try it again for a 2 night stay to celebrate our anniversary. We were upgraded to a larger suite than we had reserved. It was a beautifully appointed room with all the modern amenities. It was a smart room that had all the controls for the lighting and draperies from either room.We had a beautiful view of 5th avenue from our living room. The room came with butler service which was a great amenity.The best part of the St. Regis besides the wonderful rooms is definitely the location. You step out of the hotel and you're in the middle of a shopper's paradise. Every designer store is at your doorstep. So if you want to shop till you drop it's a great location. You're also steps away from Central Park and all the wonderful museums we have in New York City.The St. Regis has it all, great service, beautiful rooms and a perfect location. Looking to return soon to enjoy being in the city!Dear MissS85, It was truly a pleasure having you as our guest during your special occasion. Happy Anniversary and many more happy years to come!On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we are so pleased that you were able to experience our hotel and enjoy the high service and quality levels which we pride ourselves on.Thank you for your time in reviewing our property on TripAdvisor, and please let us know when you will be returning, as we would love to have you as our guest.Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager
1	Great meeting facility. I stayed her while coordinating a class in one of the hotel's meeting rooms. As the meeting planner, I was upgraded to a wonderful room on the 10th floor. It had a bar, living room, dining area, large separate bedroom and a huge bathroom with a jacuzzi tub and a huge shower. The bed was very comfortable. The meeting facility is very well run, and worth consideration if you have an event. While there is a large selection of restaurants in the casino, I only patronized two: The Cafe Sienna served up a decent, inexpensive early bird breakfast special. The Bagel Cafe Express has pretty good sandwiches, although they seemed a bit pricey. Otherwise, I preferred to get out and eat somewhere else. Across the street are a Cheesecake Factory and a Gordon Biersch Brewpub that are both great places to eat.
0	Avoid this place. I booked this place in March to attend the College World Series held in Omaha in June. I am a Platinum member of the Choice Privileges chain. I booked a non-smoking, handicap accessible room, with a king bed for June 16,- June 26, 2014. I was in receipt of the guarantee for the room. The day prior to me getting... More
0	Not good. Staff was friendly. However, they charged my debit card 3 times then when I actually got there to check in they took my credit card and charged it once. Breakfast was okay. Mostly carbs. TV didn't work at first until the next day someone came to fix it. No ironing board in the room. Was kinda noisy outside with other... More
1	Nice hotel, right on the Oceanfront. We made plans last minute so we were worried if this place would be nice. We were very happy with our experience! We were 1 hour early for check-in but the staff said it was okay. Check in was quick and fast. We parked across the street at the garage. Rooms were clean, we had requested top floor which they accommodated! View was PERFECT! Exactly what we wanted! Rooms are a bit dated like the carpet and the bathroom but very clean and plenty of towels. Room had a flat screen TV which we never even turned on because there was so much to do! Free hot breakfast was great the next morning. The staff is EXCEPTIONAL! Very friendly, they always smile. Very efficient! Every time we needed something, they went out of their way to meet our needs. I will definitely visit again just because of the family friendly atmosphere and the super attentive staff!
1	Tasteful, Modern Luxury at the St. Regis. The St. Regis San Fran is a beautiful high-rise property in a great location in one of my favorite cities. The staff was highly-attentive, but never intrusive. The room service was phenommenal and always hot, delicious, and on-time. The beds and high tech window controls were wonderful too. I didn't get a chance to eat at Ame, but I heard wonderful things about the restaurant in the hotel. The bar area was always popular for cocktails and the gym was fantastic. I would highly recommned making reservations at Gary Danko for dinner, one of the best meals I've ever had! Also Boulevard and Postrio were fantastic and R G Lounge has amazing, authentic chinesse food. I also loved Taylor's Refresher along the Embarcadero for fun and delicious diner style food in an open, casual atmosphere.Overall, the St. Regis is the place to stay if you are looking for one of the best hotels in San Fran with luxury, privacy, and amazing service.
1	Last room at the Inn. I cannot recall the last time I had an issue at a Drury Inn. Well, we did not have one at this location. The room was comfortable, the staff was attentive and helpful, and it was nicely priced more importantly, we got the last available room for the evening. Next, their complimentary breakfast was good, as well as their late afternoon meal from 5 PM 7 PM. Also, you have to have a key card to access their customer parking area. It was a nice feature which prevents people with ill intentions from driving around scoping out the scene.
1	Great Stay at the Hyatt. Just completed a one night stay at the Grand Hyatt Seattle. We were very happy with everything and can't complain. The staff was professional and courteous. Everyone from the front desk staff to the housekeeping staff was friendly and always greeted us.Jason checked us in immediately and was extremely nice, efficient, and welcoming. The house keeping staff does a great job in keeping the rooms clean. The decor was modern, the bathrooms beautiful. We were upgraded at no additional charge to a corner suite, maybe because of our Platinum status or maybe because it was a monday. The view was amazing and we loved the electronic blinds and huge room. There is a great shuttle run by Gray Line that takes you to the hotel for 17 dollars round trip, 10.25 one way. We only took the shuttle from the hotel which left at 15 minutes past the hour and 45 minutes past the hour. It was right on time and took less than 45 minutes including two stops at other hotels prior to arriving at the airport. Much cheaper than a 30-40 dollar plus tip cab ride. We have gone to the restaurant Brooklyn on this trip and our last trip also. The entertainment book provides a buy one get one free coupon for it and the food although pricey is worth it. The entertainment book provides many buy one get one free coupons to local attractions including the art museum, Victoria Clipper, aquarium, and others. The hotel is in a good location to attractions and shopping.Pikes market is a straight 10-15 minute walk from the hotel. It is right next door to an awesome movie theatre and the Cheese Cake factory. If you can get a great deal this is a hotel that I would go back to.
0	I was charged more. The bill receipt which I have received from Days Inn says 376 dollar for two room but when I checked my credit statement it shows two transaction of 204 was charged.
0	good but ehh. it was ok I guess looks were deceiving
1	Great location, rooms, pool. Located just a few blocks from the bus station and Reading Terminal Market, the location is great for tourists! The pool and jacuzzi were small but great amenity, and the room was huge and quiet with a fabulous view, and they provided us with a nice and clean pack 'n play. Breakfast was pricey so we ate daily at Reading Terminal Market's Down Home Diner which was cheap and delish!Thank you for staying at the Courtyard Philadelphia Downtown and for your review and excellent rating. We are delighted our location was perfect for your needs and that you were impressed with your accommodation along with the great view it provided. We are also happy that our on-site amenities were to your liking. However, we are sorry for any inconvenience caused. We enjoyed having you as our guest and hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back in the future.Thank you, David KiddAssistant General Manager
1	A gem in San Francisco. I travel for a work a lot. I've stayed at three of the four Personality Hotels in SF, but Kensington Park is my favorite. The location is perfect, even though it's a 15-minute walk to work I'd rather walk because it gives me option in my (limited) free time. Right there in the heart of Union Square. The staff at Kensington are incredible, the best in the business. The rooms are comfortable and well appointed. They aren't the biggest rooms but they're pretty standard for SF. Great location, great staff, great value and nice accommodations. You can't beat that.Dear Laura M, Thank you for taking the time to post your review on TripAdvisor. Thank you for allowing us the opportunity to host you during your stay at Kensington Park. We are humbled to have received such thoughtful comments, for there is no greater satisfaction than receiving kind words. We appreciate your comments for our well-appointed guests room and amenities. When the occasion arises please contact me and I will personally assists you with your reservation to visit the 4th Personality Hotels. Your business is much appreciated and we will do our very best to continue to meet your expectations. We look forward to welcoming you back soon. Best regards, Lilia Calvario
0	Room for improvement. I had called from the airport to ensure that a refrigerator was in my room upon arrival. I was assured that one would be installed. I got to my room at 1:00am and no frig....one was delivered at 2 am.Upon checking in I gave details as to how I needed the bill split between me and my roommate who was arriving the next day. I gave the front desk my roommate's name as I wasn't going to be around whenshe arrived.When my roommate arrived the front desk said that they were not aware of her arrival.Upon checking out the bill wasnot split like I was ensured it would be.When I booked the room I requested a 1 pm. checkout versus 12 noon. I was assured that as an Elite member it wouldn't be a problem. I also confirmed an extended checkout time when checking in and the front desk assured me that I was all set.On day of check out I was told that I could not have a 1 hour extension.And last but not least I had requested the room cleaned before 2 pm... I was told that housekeepingwas being sent right up... that was at 11 am. Apparently they took a wrong turn as they didn't show up until 6 pm.All in all it was not a typicalMarriott experienceThank you for your feedback, and we apologize for the issues you experienced. Please don't hesitate to contact us directly if you'd like to discuss your experience further, and thank you for staying with us.
1	Ocean Fix. Can't be much closer to the ocean, listening to the waves as you sleep. Price is right, clean rooms with great parking. Only real flaw, new carpeting is needed. When booking request the quiet side or next time we would preferably book the rooms right on the boardwalk, worth the extra money. Great location for a lot less cost. Patrick was very friendly when we checked in. Went the extra for making our stay as great as possible.We are one of the few properties in San Diego that gives guests the ability to listen to the ocean waves from their rooms! Many guests also report seeing dolphins from their balconies. Were happy you could enjoy this.Also, the next time you stay with us every room on the property will have new carpet! This process is currently underway and will conclude by the end of February.Thank you for the kind words about our staff, your compliments will be passed along. Thanks for staying with us!
1	Place to be. This hotel is the place to be to experience downtown Seattle. The Monorail, Seattle Center, are across the street and the waterfront is walkable or by shuttle. The Light Rail from Westlake Center can take you right out to Sea-Tac. We'll be back!!!Sarah P,Thank you for staying with us next to the Space Needle! We love our incredible location and are ecstatic that you felt the same way. As one of the newest members to the Hyatt family, we are more than appreciative of your feedback and am glad to see you enjoyed your stay. We pride ourselves on our guest satisfaction and hope to see you again soon in the near future.Sarah Junge
1	Hotel on the hill. Make sure you have your walking shoes if you book this old hotel in Seattle as the hill to enter is steep. The rooms are charming and dated back to past times. You can open the windows in your room to enjoy the fresh Seattle air as the AC does not pump out a great amount of air. Good location to enjoy all the surrounding downtown sites. Hi Captain Tony - Thank you for your review! Yes, walking shoes for getting around Seattle is a must. . .five hills make up the city and our First Hill is one of them (but actually not the steepest!). We hope you'll stay with us again when your travels bring you back to Seattle.
0	It was OK.. For the price and name, I expected better. The mattress was old and hard, as were the towels. The water pressure fluctuated and was poor. Extra coffee was brought upon request but without cream and sugar. It was overpriced for what you got. However, the staff was good and kind.
1	A beautiful experience. This hotel is everything you would hope for. Beautifully appointed. Great comfort. Good restaurants and bar. Excellent location. And most of all, a superlative staff. We were treated with care and expertise by this wonderful group of people. I can't remember being this happy in any hotel and I plan to return whenever possible. Highly recommended!Dear Guest,Your kind words are very much appreciated and we thank you for taking time to share your most recent experience at The St. Regis San Francisco. We pride ourselves in providing exceptional service and we are happy to hear that we were able to create a memorable experience for you. We hope to welcome you into our doors again on your next visit to San Francisco.Sincerely,William FongHotel Manager415-284-4057
1	Clean, comfortable, great location.. Very convenient location--took the Link in from SEA, and the stop was just a couple blocks away. Check in was quick and painless, and they gave me an upgrade per my Globalist (ugh, it pains me each time I type that) status to a corner suite. It was on the back side of the hotel (away from the Sound view), but it was a spacious room with the necessary accoutrements. The bed was comfortable, and the housekeeping staff was friendly. The club had a better spread than some other locations, and ample seating. Otherwise as far as restaurant outlets in the hotel, they had a Ruth's Chris (didn't go) and a deli/convenience store. There's a bunch of places within walking distance though, covering all types of cuisine, and it's very easy to get to the tourist attractions not too much of a jaunt to Safeco Field either.Would definitely recommend.
0	Okay for the price. I was not expecting Scotty's Motel to be fancy considering the price but I was expecting clean. This was the second dirtiest hotel I have stayed in. Our room was dirty and had not been dusted in a very long time. There were cobwebs everywhere. The tub was not clean. I don't mind out dated furniture and carpeting, but I... More
1	Enjoyed my Stay!!. This hotel is nice. The staff is great and we chose to use valet parking. There is parking available on each side of the hotel, however, we opt for valet. This is a very busy hotel with several events (weddings etc...) going on. The rooms are spacious as well as the bath. The bed was too soft for my liking. Great location for shopping and eating. Restaurants all around, Walgreens, Pizza Hut, Chick fil A all nearby. Easy access to and from the interstate. I am glad you enjoyed your stay with us and had a chance to experience some of the restaurants around us. There is so much to do in this area! Hope to see you soon.
0	Avoid at all costs. I really hope someone in the hotel groups management reads this. I will give a little background on the situation. The first part is completely out of the hotels control and I don't blame them for any of it, but their part in what happened to me and my mother last night is frankly disgusting. My dad passed away quite... More
0	Not a 3* Resort. This motel is definitely not a 3* resort so make sure you know that before booking a room at the Baymont Inn and Suites. The place is pretty shabby and rundown. The room I had needed to be updated -as the sheets were dingy, and the bathtub was old and rusty. The breakfast was so nasty that I had to... More
0	Great location lousy service. The hotel is new and the rooms are very nice BUTthe waiting time for the elevator in the morning can be up to 20 minthe Que for breakfast is so long and you cant even get a seatno poolrooftop is closed in winterthe free shuttle bus... you need to wait from 30-45 min for 5 min drive and 15 min walkhouse keeping do very little - room was not cleaned as expected when you call the reception it takes 5-10 min to be answered
1	Great service. We arrived at this hotel at 11am and our room 709 was ready. No noise comfortable room. The roof top pool was OK temperature for a night swim, even though it was cold outside. Jacuzzi was hot. Small exercize room. On major bus lines but it was quicker to walk to French Quarter and Riverwalk. The breakfast and afternoon kickback were good. Three well drinks p/p at happy hour made me happy. The entire hotel was very clean, well maintained and in a safe neighborhood. And by the way, we took the public bus from the airport for 2. It is called Jefferson transit,leaves every half hour, you can take two pieces of luggage, it took 1/2 hour to arrive three blocks from the hotel.
0	Unbelieveable for the worst place I have stayed. From my confirmed reservation, to the change in pricing at check in, to the room and what was in it, to the slamming of doors all through the night and morning, to the couple who were having a custody battle over a child of theirs in the hallway what can I say but I wouldn't stay there again! No smoking... More
0	I won't return to this hotel. There was an old, musty smell in the room and the internet did not work. we could only pick up wifi in the hallway. These two components alone are enough to put this hotel at the bottom of my list, but what tops it off is the poor service. The front desk staff does the bare minimum to accommodate guests. It is apparent that they do not care about whether or not we have an enjoyable stay. At check in, we had a question about why our room did not have a microfridge and wanted to know what it would take to get one. The clerk that we initially spoke to was rude and gave us information that the supervisor later informed us was incorrect. The following day we went for breakfast after a morning meeting-- we got there at 930 and it ends at 930, but everything was still set up and the man at the desk was preparing waffles for himself. We went to make waffles as well and he informed us that there was no more mix and because it was 930 they would not restock. Normally I wouldn't have a problem with that policy, but having just watched him fix himself a big plate literally 30seconds earlier, it felt incredibly inconsiderate and cold. Ultimately, if you need to stay here because it is the best option for your paycheck, it may work for you, but do not expect too much in regards to customer service. On the other hand, if you can afford the extra 10-15 dollars it may cost to stay somewhere else, do yourself a favor an stay elsewhere. I am will not return to this hotel.
0	Random fees. We stayed 1 night. while the hotel was beautiful and the staff were pleasant,I inquired about extra charges to my card, no one knew why. I then emailed twice and called again (international as I was on my honeymoon) with no response!!! How frustrating to know so much was charged without a reason why or enteraction from staff!I am very sorry to hear about what has happened during and after your stay with us. We want to make sure all of our guests have the best possible stay and I can see that we dropped the ball when it came to yours. I ask that you reach out to me at brian.daviswhitneyhotel.com or call me directly at 504-581-4222, so that we can get this resolved right away. Thank you and I hope to hear from you soon.
0	Don't even dream about staying here!. This is by far the worst hotel (as opposed to motel) I have ever stayed in. I stayed in room 305, and when I tried to close the window, the window frame came away in my hand.To give you an idea of the state of the place, the metal tissue holders in the bathroom were covered with rust.Breakfast consisted of the cheapest bagels one can imagine, an apple, a blueberry muffin, some synthetic-tasting orange juice, and some mediocre coffee, with only powdered whitener - not even milk.The decoration of the room looked like it had been done by a 10 year old, it was so shabby.Finding the place in the first place, and getting there amidst all of the construction was a nightmare - although to be fair to the owners that's not their fault.What an awful first experience of Seattle - it certainly made me reticent about visiting the city again if that's in any way representative.Incidentally, this is the first review I've contributed, which indicates hiw bad this place was.Thank you for taking the time to review our property. We truly value the opinions of our customers and we apologize that we did not meet your expectations. Providing our guests with the best possible hospitality and service has always been our mission. We apologize for window in your room and the furnishings that did not meet your standards. We continually strive to keep our property clean, friendly, and welcoming. We want you to know that we truly enjoy sharing our passion for our destination with visitors and want you to walk out the door feeling refreshed. If you come back to our hotel I would love to have the opportunity to speak with you directly, so please ask for me. We hope to see you again in the future and wish you the very best.
1	Peaceful retreat from the hustle and bustle ofthe city!. Steps away from the Dragon Gate entrance into Chinatown, this modern, environmentally friendly hotel was a great place to stay. The staff at the front desk, the bellman, and the waitstaff were helpful, friendly, and courteous. The rooms were very quiet on the ninth floor. Bedding was comfortable and shower facilities acceptable. Requests were prompt. Breakfast downstairs seemed pricey until you realized it came with juice, fruit, and coffee. Not one complaint on the quality or service. The location is close to Union Square, Chinatown, and the Financial District. I would highly recommend this hotel.Dear guest Emmacakes,Your comment is well appreciated and will be shared with all team members so they read the great feedback from our guests. Breakfast is an experience in itself and well worth the value considering all the extra additions we provide.Looking forward to welcoming you back soon, Pablo B. General Manager
1	Must Stay for Lenox Square. My family and I have been staying at the JW Marriott Buckhead for many years and have never been disappointed. The staff, ambiance, and convenience to Lenox Square Mall makes it a perfect place to relax and enjoy a fun weekend getaway. The rooms are always clean and spacious. My daughter claims the JW has the best and most comfortable beds of anywhere! The valet service was great and once we called from the room, our car was waiting on us with cold bottled water in the cupholders. I've never had a single bad experience at this hotel. Keep up the great work!
0	One night stay. The bed was comfortable. The room had a bad musty smell. Was not cleaned well. Happy that I only had to stay one night.
0	Do not recommend this hotel. Looks very nice from the streets, but not a clean place to stay. Went to use the microwave in the lobby a guest was using it before me she standing in front of the microwave with the trash can throwing up in it, the microwave was dirty inside. The rooms are not up to par. Not a good stay for me.
0	Chelsea Annex is somewhere I would not recommend!. Our stay was mediocre at best! There is CHELSEA and Chelsea ANNEX. We had the ANNEX, and it was in poor condition. Furniture was far from nice, front desk and lobby gave you a very good first impression. The people at the desk were nice. One block from the beach, which was huge for me. Paid parking at 10 a day in a lot about 1.5 blocks away, or, 15 a day got valet. The elevator was very rough to ride. There was a small, but nice, pool. No coffee maker, no microwave, no mini-frig, ices machine did not work very well. Out air conditioning was set at 50* and it was so hot in there, especially for sleeping. The maintenance man said it couldn't get any cooler because it ran on cold water, and the water wasn't cold! If you are in AC to gamble, or go to the beach, this is fine to use the beaten down bathroom, or lay your head on a pillow. We won't be guests here again!
0	Awful service. Horribly managed property Cannot believe owners allow current management to run this property Good housekeeping, great pool (one of the biggest I have ever seen) and nice grounds will return if the owners replace current general manager
1	free parking, good pool hot tub free wifi. we stayed here for 4 nights and loved the free wifi, good coverage for TV - tiny tiny bathroom with the sink outside of the bathroom which works well for us, no closet doors there was a fridge in the room and a coffee pot -lots of drawer space, a restaurant and bar on site and free parking - located in hotel circle amongst lots of other hotels -- not really walking distance to anything of interest but easy driving to a huge mall -- one odd thing is that there are two stairs to get to the ground floor rooms from the handicap parking space - good value - very clean - took ages to check in and out - they have all the info they can use before you get there why dont they use it Breakfast was not included in our rate so ask - you may save a ton of money by going elsewhere to eatDear Guest,Thank you for choosing the Best Western Seven Seas for your San Diego accommodations and for sharing your experience. We are happy to hear that you enjoyed our free Wi-Fi service, along with the cleanliness of our hotel, free parking, and onsite restaurant and bar. We apologize that the check in process was slower than expected and that breakfast was not included, but we are glad you enjoyed our many amenities. We hope that you will stay with us again soon to experience the many great elements of our hotel. Many thanks again for your time and review.Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management Staff
1	Quiet Area And Within Walking Distance of Attractions. Very quiet area with nice small hotel bar, good breakfast, clean rooms, private courtyard with pool, friendly service and private hotel parking. We have stayed at the Landmark Hotel before in a quiet room facing the courtyard, which is a must when booking at this hotel, but this visit the room was next to the elevator, this is why I only gave 4 stars for this stay, otherwise it would have been 5 stars. The noise of the elevator from 11:30pm to 2:30am continuously woke us up, so when booking a room ask for a room facing the courtyard but not next to the elevator! The hotel was is just a few blocks from Bourbon St. and a nice walk to Jefferson Square and the French Market. One of the Hop-On-Hop-Off bus stops is just a few blocks from the hotel on Rampart, very convenient! The Hotel is right across the street from Louis Armstrong Park which has a very nice park which I highly recommend to take a stroll in during the day.I am pleased to hear you enjoyed our hotel and staff. I am sorry to hear that the elevator kept you up. If you give us another chance we will make sure to put you in a quiet room. I hope the next time you are in New Orleans you will come back and see us. Please call me directly when you are ready to book so I can show our appreciation. 504-522-8531 Sincerely, Chastity
1	Great Hotel just close enough to everything!. Drury New Orleans was great and I even changed my reservation 3 different times. The last time they booked us for a suite the first night (because of lack of availability) and booked us the regular room the other nights. However, when we arrived, they let us have the suite for all 3 nights and did not charge additional (I might add that it was during the week). This way we didn't have to change rooms. Valet parking, although expensive, was great w/not too long of a wait. Free breakfast (multiple waffle makers, sausage, eggs, pastries, gravy, fruit etc.--not super high quality but better than a lot of hotels), snack type dinner (hotdogs, chicken strips, meatballs, etc..--again, not super high quality but plenty of food excellent offerings especially if you are on a budget), and free popcorn pops from 3-10pm. You could actually eat breakfast at the hotel, dinner at the hotel and then only pay for lunch if you wanted to. My absolutely only complaint about this hotel was that they offered 3 alcoholic drinks for each adult in the evening 5-7 during dinner (only 3 different drinks offered). We are not big drinkers but like to have one from time to time. We ordered one 2 different nights but were unable to drink them because they were so incredibly strong--we even asked to go light on the alcohol to no avail. We were also disappointed they didn't have a full bar where you could pay for a frozen drink if you wanted. Other than that small detail this hotel was really clean, nice clean pool w/plenty of clean towels, friendly staff, quiet and close enough to walk to shops and such. It seemed to be located between the Garden District the French Quarter. We definitely would return.
1	Guest. The location of this hotel was convenient and easy to get around. We made use of the shuttle service as well as the public transportation. The service was great and the personnel did not hesitate to respond to any of our requests. I will be a guest again.Thank you so much for telling us about your recent experience at our hotel. We are so glad that you had a pleasant stay. We strive everyday to exceed our guest expectations. We look forward to serving you and your family in the future!Thank you for making it the Hampton Inn By Hilton Philadelphia Airport!Adrian Woods, Director of Sales
1	Very Nice hotel. Hotel stay was excellent. The hotel staff from the valet to the front desk to the extremely clean rooms was worth the visit. My wife and I look forward to coming back and this is in this hotel soon. Thanks to all who made our stay enjoyable for my wife's birthday.We are so pleased to hear we were able to make your wife's birthday celebration that much more special. Thank you so much for choosing us to be a part of such a celebration and for sharing your thoughts with us on TripAdvisor. Please do come visit us again soon.
0	Stay in a tent first!. This hotel was awful. My boyfriend and I were going for an anniversary weekend as we aren't 21 yet, it was hard to get a hotel in downtown Seattle. We read the bad reviews, but decided to take a chance as our options were severely limited. The room was on the first floor, opened into a parking lot and the door had at least an inch of clearance from the floor. (this was the 'king suite'!) We had to plug this gap with a towel at night to keep out the loud freeway noise and cold air. The bed was only questionably clean, and some of the lights didn't work. Our biggest problem, however, was with the shower! The water pressure was ridiculously high if you stood in the spray, the pressure was so bad that it would ricochet off your body and through the curtain, no matter how tightly you closed it. A lot of water ended up on the floor our first morning, and after we dressed we went to inform the man at the front desk. As soon as I began to politely describe the problem, he very loudly interrupted me, telling me that there have never been any complaints such as this before in my opnion, this indicates that there probably have, but that's just my intuition. He followed us to the room and looked at the bathroom, very loudly and rudely proclaiming that it was all our fault the whole time. He closed the curtain and attempted to demonstrate how the water could be kept in the shower although water was still coming out (which my boyfriend politely indicated) he refused to acknowledge that and even went so far as to accuse us of doing 'wild things' in the shower!! For the record, shampooing my hair was about as wild as I got in there, and I doubt my boyfriend was doing anything weird during his shower either. We ended up having to pay a fee to clean it up, and I will never stay there again. I would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone!!
1	Feel like your in Hawaii and only travel to San Diego. We stayed in a great room facing the ocean and from the living room and bedroom you could see the ocean and listen to the waves all night. Great place, nice breakfast, and very large rooms. The staff are amazing and very ready and willing to help. It the kind of place that I would recommend to anyone and everyone. There is a kitchen in the room, but all the nice dinning restaurants are well within an easy walk.Hi Tony W, Thank you for the great review! We are flattered by your comments and glad that our location over the Pacific set the tone for an unforgettable stay. We look forward to creating many more wonderful memories for you in the future. Terima Kasih, (Thank you in Balinese)Dallas King
0	NO NO NO. Estes Park is very crowded on these nice fall days, and there was a limited amount of rooms available throughout the resort. We booked this room as we were travelling and I did not check the reviews first. BIG MISTAKE! I would give this place a negative worse than terrible if I could. We had our day in Estes... More
1	Cooler than custard!! I love it!. What a cool hotel! Super friendly, helpful and thorough check in and up to a super cool room!The views are amazing, the location couldnt be better! Youre ten-fifteen minutes from all the sights! Check out the view from my room!!Awesome! My favourite hotel by a long way.Dont stay somewhere average, dont stay somewhere boring stay here and feel the coolness permeate to you!Good work guys! Good workMartin, Have to say, this is my favourite review of the day!! Your don't stay somewhere average... line is classic. Perhaps you should be our new pitchman! Thanks for the recognition of the good work, a lot goes into getting this right from the brand, to the design and of course the most important part the staff! Thanks for staying here and hope to have you back soon! Evan
1	Small and adorable.. Nice spacious rooms, good location . The only thing bad about it is that they don't have buffet breakfast and it takes lot of time to get a table and it becomes quite expensive too. 2 of the mornings, I was offered high chairs of bar for breakfast which is not ideal when you pay about 60 dollars for simple omlette, juice and black coffee. But overall very good.Dear neeraj821,Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at The St. Regis New York, and thank you for your comments regarding breakfast. We will share your feedback with our team for review, and appreciate your thoughts. We hope to see you again soon.Kindly,Octavia MargineanHotel Manager
1	On the edge of the French Quarter. I was worried that we would be a bit too far from the action of the Vieux Carre, but not indeed! The sights and activities were all within a short walk. Check in was quick, the staff at the front desk friendly and helpful with suggestions. The room itself, as noted by other reviews, is on the small side, but who cares, who is spending time in the room anyway! We were only there for one night. The breakfast has both hot and cold breakfast items, and while it was busy, the staff kept things well supplied. There is some construction going on in the street in front of the hotel, but that was not bothersome. I hate paying for parking, but it's a city--what are you going to do.... The parking area is kind of small, and the parking spots themselves are smallish. Dont' take a big car or truck!Thanks for choosing The Best Western Plus French Quarter the Hidden Gem. We hope that your next stay will be longer, Glenn JohnsonMgr. on Duty
1	Nice place, but would do the trip differently. This is an old historic hotel, with the expected creaky floors, but it was also just a little musty and had dirty carpet. If the French Quarter is your scene, but you don't want to be right on the loud vomit-filled Bourbon street then this is a very good choice. The location is on the edge of the Quarter, within easy walking distance of the party, Jackson Square, the French Market, and many great restaurants. Some of the rooms here are very small, while others are quite large. We wanted a balcony, but accidentally booked a sun deck room, which is nothing like a private balcony. The sun deck is a large communal patio with several rooms opening out to it, and it has tall concrete walls with no view, and burning hot sun. This room was very small, with no windows, and so we asked for another room. Even though it was our fault that we booked the wrong type of room the staff was incredibly friendly and accomodating, and they moved us to a room with a balcony - luckily one was available because we were staying during the week and not the weekend. All of the balcony rooms look out over the garden patio, and not the street, but the room was very large and bright. The garden area is small but pleasant, and we did enjoy sitting out there for our morning coffee. The free breakfast here is very minimal - breads, coffee, and cereal, so it is good for a quick bite, but certainly not something to look forward to. One of the best things about this place is the staff. Incredibly friendly and helpful. Everyone is willing to answer questions, and they do it with a smile and without ever acting like they expect a tip. Of course we did tip, and they were always very genuine in their appreciation. We got great recommendations for restaurants within walking distance - one was Irene's, a popular creole restaurant with great food and a fun atmosphere, but a very long wait and the other restaurant we enjoyed was Sylvain which is a small funky place with great food. Also within easy waking distance we enjoyed Mr. B's Bistro for lunch, and a glass of wine at the Carousel Bar in the Hotel Monteleone. These are all nice places for sober or semi-sober grown ups, free of loud drunks wearing beads.While the French Quarter was interesting, one day was more than enough for me. It is not the fault of the Bienville House, but the whole Quarter smells of rotting garbage and other unpleasantries. While I enjoy a drink or two, Burbon Street had absolutely no appeal to me, full of 20-somethings walking down the street yelling, carrying their giant beers/drinks, covered in beads, and this starts at 10am. If that is for you, enjoy, but I didn't need more than 10 minutes of that, so if I were ever to return to NOLA I would most definitely stay in the beautiful Garden District - there are many beautiful historic hotels here, and if you stay on or near St. Charles Street you are near the cable street car and can easily get to the Quarter whenever you want. The Garden District also has many excellent restaurants, and is close to Magazine Street, which is where the real shopping is, assuming you want something other than t-shirts with obscene sayings on them.The Bienville House is a nice place, which could use some upgrades, and it is perfect if you want to spend your time in the French Quarter, but somewhat away from the worst of it. We loved the friendly and helpful staff here, and did enjoy many good things within walking distance. However, if non-stop drinking isn't your scene I would recommend looking into the Garden District - much more peaceful and beautiful, and an easy cable car ride to the Quarter when you want it.
0	Mixed feelings.. Location wise it's not bad but this hotel is in need of some renovations. On my visit which was on super bowl weekend only one of the elevators was working. As well on two of the five nights the fire alarm went off with no voice commands over the intercom. The fire doors would close automatically and during the week... More
0	Great location not worth the money. First, the place is located in a great place. And the woman who greeted me was very very helpful and nice. However, if you're on a business trip and need the ammenities that come with a well-stocked hotel, this place is not for you. I had a single room on the top floor (4th floor), I had no air-conditioning, no fan, and the window didn't create air flow in the room (when the temperature was 80 degrees outside, the room was much warmer). I'm not quite sure what the other reviews mean when they say all the rooms are huge because I had a really small room, with a twin bed that barely fit me. The WIFI was worse than the modem I used in 1997 and I barely could get anything done on my computer (I couldn't even check in for my flight on my computer). There is no television in your room. I had to share a bathroom with other people (which is fine), but it's nice to have your own, especially when you're running around to get out the door fast. One morning, I had to leave around 6 AM, and I think I actually stood naked in the shower for about 5 minutes for the water to get hot. I guess this place would be great if you just needed a base camp for your time in Boston. I was there for job interviews (and I thought I could save some money), but I actually regret it since one night, the room was so hot, I think I only had 2-3 hours of sleep.
1	Trendy hotel DT Phoenix. We had a great stay at The Foundre while in town for a concert. Everything about this hotel was hip right down to the buttons in the elevators. The art was awesome...the Burt Reynolds painting still continues to make me laugh. Be sure to check out the artwork of Phoenix made out of recycled security envelopes and checks...so cool! The room had an industrial-style and were uber-clean. Beds were comfy. Located right next to the lightrail it is an easy ride to the center of downtown Phoenix. Oh and the staff was friendly and helpful!Wow! Thank you so much for this awesome review! We're so happy to hear you had a great stay and loved the hotel. Hope you will visit again soon.
1	Very nice hotel. The hotel is very nice. People are very willing to help with whatever you need. Restaurant on the main floor is actually food in the bar. Expensive and nothing to write home about. The breakfast buffet is now 26/person which is exorbitant, in my opinion. At 200+ per night they should include breakfast.Thank you for your visit and input. I am delighted you found the hotel nice and our staff very willing to assist. We pride ourselves on our service levels so I am happy we did not disappoint. I will share your comments with our Chef as we want to exceed your dining expectations.
0	In need of a visit from Undercover Boss. The staff was super friendly. 5 stars for the young gentleman who checked us in. The physical property is seriously in need of repair. The breakfast area was fairly dirty - trash cans and cabinets covered in residue. Ramada needs to invest some in taking care of the property. Give the wonderful employees something to be proud of.
0	Looks good on the outside but a real dump inside. I made the mistake of waiting until I got into town to book a hotel. Unfortunately rooms were very scarce and I was limited to 3 hotels. I cross-referenced with the bedbug sight and eliminated one immediately. I decided on Key West so I drove up to it before booking. It looks great from the outside so I booked with... More
0	Location, location. A typical Hampton Inn. Two issues, however. Located at an exit that has no town around it...just 2 other motels restaurants, gas, etc. 1or 2 exits. The most bothersome feature is that the approach is a very dark road which turns out is a divided parkway with nothing but a few short white stakes to mark it. We ran up... More
0	Less than I expected from Hyatt. There was nothing major wrong, just several small things. The tv remote battery cover was missing and had been taped, the alarm clock was showing the wrong time and it had no battery cover or batteries, couldn't figure how to set the time. The ceilingabove the bed had a big dark stain, there was a small tear in the couch... More
0	Holes in carpets. Run down for a new hotel.. It was a recently built hotel allowed to fall into disrepair. Staff was gone or unhelpful. Room felt like a motel 6. Maybe. Was ok for 85. But no more. View of interstate exit ramp. I would recommend most other places. It did in a pinch and was close to dc. Didn't feel unsafe. Just unkept. It was fine to sleep in. And the pool was nice.
0	i cant believe i even had to pay. Worst hotel experience ever. Very seedy place.
1	Great nights sleep. We stay at this hotel several times during the year while visiting family. Always have a peaceful and comfortable sleep. The bed is very comfortable and the breakfast items are a nice touch for a quick grab and go if you don't have time to go to the restaurant next door. There are many different restaurants nearby also. Usually the road noise is very minimal. Great choice for travelers, close to everything in the Napa Valley. Shirley A - Thank you for taking the time to write such a kind review. We do our best to make sure everyone's stay is as pleasant as yours was. We look forward to your next visit. Thank you - Genafer, Director of Sales
0	The Worst Stay in Years!!!. The General Manager was absolute jerk to me, my fianc and my friends who also had their own room. The other front desk representatives were equally unwelcoming and rude! The advertised room price was not honored at all and I inquired while they were actually putting the discounted price up! With the poor level of customer service and the false advertising, I actually thought about reporting them. It was a Vacation and I wasnt trying to spend my time thinking about legal issues. But I was apauled by this hotel. Never will I stay with them again.
1	Fantastic stay!. Just got back from an amazing weekend at the St. Regis. We used our starpoints to reserve a night at the St. Regis in celebration of our anniversary. I had high hopes for a Category 7 hotel - and St. Regis did not disappoint! We'd had a bit of a rough journey, but from the moment Pascal took our bags to Jose at the front desk checking us in, Ildna showing me to the fitness room where I could have a little workout before our room was ready - everyone took such great care of us. We will definitely be back!Dear Traveller94115, We are very pleased to learn that Pascal, Jose and Ilona all provided you with exceptional service during your recent visit to The St. Regis New York. Thank you for your time, and for recognizing our mission to provide the best service and pampering experience to each of our guests. We look forward to sharing your review with the team, and we hope that we will have the opportunity of having you as our guest very soon!Warmest Regards,The St. Regis Management Team
1	Perfect first time visit to Chicago. This unassuming hotel is well located for sightseeing, restaurants and views of the Chicago River and the river walk. The rooms are comfortable with basic amenities and free wi-fi but best suited for one person. A guest lounge on the second floor offers a large lobby, TV, computer terminals and an array of snacks, fruit, beverages. The highest praise is reserved for the front desk staff - Ramon and Diego were friendly and competent making restaurant suggestions that were delicious (Benny's Chop House).Dear Jeri G, thank you for taking the time to write a review and especially the kind words you had for Roman, Diego and the staff. There is nothing we love more than being able to share wonderful comments like yours with the staff and we will be sure the team sees it. We are so glad you choose The River Hotel for your first visit to Chicago as our prime location makes an ideal base for experiencing all the city has to offer. We look forward to welcoming you back soon!
0	Not worth the money. Room smelled musty. No elevator, and very second rate breakfast. Definitely not worth the price.
0	would not stay here again..... Room 711- This was a two night stay for a training session and upon checking in I discovered the desk chair was all ripped up (plether- plastic leather) missing from 1/3 of the seat, living room chair was used as a cat scratching post, stained dirty drapes, carpet-not vacuumed, no hot water in the tiny stand-up curtained shower-four mins into the shower-lather on hair and soap all over- (got points for my unfortunate experience). One of the bedroom doors (2 BR suite) had nail heads sticking out (discovered them when placing my hand there). Knowing that it was spring break week, I would think the staff was ready for the crowd- room was not serviced on day 2 of the stay until much later in the afternoon. Going back to Hilton.Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your guest experience. I was disappointed to hear that the experience was not to your satisfaction or our standards. I sincerely apologize that the issue was not corrected prior to your departure. I appreciate you bringing this to our attention so that we can improve the service we provide our guests.Sincerely,Traci
0	Has-Been Hotel. This was my 3rd time to stay at ZaZa since it opened in 2002 and each time it has been worse. The 1st time it was okay I guess- it was new and trendy and something different. The last two times the service has gone...More
1	Service the old fashion way!!. Like I said, Service Service, Service, the old fashion way. We booked this on line and went off the reviews from Tripadvisor. The hotel is more incrediable in person. We happen to love the decor. The staff was over the top friendly and helpful. Someone said it was a noisy intersection, we didn't notice, our window faced the front of the hotel. The room was awesome, with a separate lounge area and bedroom. I felt like a queen in bed with all the down pillows, I was watching the Royals and waiting for the new prince to be born. I wish we could have stayed longer. We will be back if opportunity allows it. Thank you for your kind words! I agree, a perfect place to watch the Royal wedding! Hope you came down for afternoon tea. :)Randall ObrechtGeneral ManagerSorrento Hotel
1	Very Good Hotel. Stay for 2 nights on October with my wife. The hotel decoration is very classy, from the lobby up to our room. Check-in and check-out is very smooth. Location wise, even it is close to some major attractions (Union square, etc) but also close to Tenderloin which make us feels a bit insecure (not their fault btw). Only problem is on our last day just before check-out when we waited for the lift for nearly 10 mins. We've got to drag our heavy luggage and found out that the lift is out of service. At least put some sign on each floor that the lift is broken. Otherwise everything else should be ok.Dear Andai,We are so fortunate to have you and your wife as our guests this year in our hotel. We thank you for taking the time to leave us your review. More importantly, we are glad our staff was able to have a smooth check-in and check-out for you. We do apologized for the lift breaking down on your last day with us, we do thank you for your feedback and we will definitely take the appropriate measurements on notifying people when it breaks down next time. We look forward to seeing you again and we appreciate your kind words.Luis MoralesHotel Manager
1	Classic Hotel. I loved this hotel. It captures a distinctive golden age vibe in a very special way. On check-in, there was a small disturbance in the lobby due to the behaviour of another guest who was unhappy with her allocated room. The only blip during our stay was that the room we were allocated with an external view was clearly given to this complaining guest. The manager literally took the key from the hands of the lady checking us in as she was giving them to me (and after we had been told what a lovely room we had been allocated)... But the hotel was professional enough to deal with our concern immediately, and we were given a gorgeous external view room facing onto Fifth Avenue and complimentary breakfast and drinks. This rapid commitment to service was indicative of the rest of our stay. Otherwise, the whole stay was perfect. The room was elegant. It felt very classic and luxurious, but also had any modern convenience. The King Cole bar was the perfect place to meet friends. The complimentary Bentley was a special touch to drop us to dinner at a perfect concierge recommendation. We loved the atmosphere in the hotel restaurant the next morning for breakfast. I would stay here again without hesitation. We felt valued and special.Dear johntillett, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor. We hope to see you again soon!Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager
1	Loved this hotel. This was my first visit to New Orleans and the first time I have ever stayed at a Drury Inn. The hospitality was great! Room was clean, the appliances and TV were in good working order. The beds were comfortable. I felt safe, Only guests were able to use the elevators with their key cards. The only complaint was the ice machine was near our room and it was making lots of noise. They were able to fix the problem the next day.The breakfast bar and appetizers were very good. Lots of variety and plenty to eat. If you are going with children or teenagers, it is very good on your food budget. The hotel was near the St Charles trolley line and Jackson Square. I was able to walk to the square early in the morning and just enjoy some people watching. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it highly.
1	Front Desk Agent - Leon Williams. I had the most pleasant experience at checkin today thanks to Leon Williams. It is so nice when the start of the hotel experience is off to a great start from checkin. Leon is friendly, helpful, and amiable. Every checkin experience should be this fabulous and wonderful. Thank you for the fantastic 5 star review! I am so happy you enjoyed your entire experience. Leon will be very happy to see he made an impact and I appreciate your taking the time to recognize his efforts. We look forward to welcoming you back to sunny San Diego and the Westin San Diego on your next trip.
1	Spacious rooms, great location, welcoming staff. I have stayed at this and its sister hotel the Orchard Hotel, also in Bush Street, a number of times and keep going back because of its location close to Union Square and the central business area of SF. The rooms are comfortable, clean and very spacious, Bathrooms are modern and well laid out. Concierge, reception and housekeeping staff very friendly and efficient. I will make one request for my next visit, please provide chair for desk that can be adjusted for working at the desk.We appreciate your kind review and your continued business, Chris! We will take your feedback about the chair into consideration. Hope you'll be in again soon! Best,Pablo B. General Manager
0	Best Western -Lanham MD. The hotel was very unclean and the staff acted as if it was a chore to do their job. I had items let in my room from previous consumers. My room had cob webs in the ceiling and the bathroom was dirty. I spoke with the front desk and she was very nanchalant, telling me someone would call be back but to this day no one called me back. My car almost got towed because the front desk person forgot to give me a parking pass to park on hotel property. I had to rushout to speak with the tow truck gentleman, then she gently said O i'm sorry, I forgot

We had booked at this hotel 4 months in advance because TripAdvisor said this was the 1 hotel in Winnfield and honestly we did not even stay for 1 hour, we went to our room called La Jagu and moved to that hotel, please see my review of that hotel for information about it. When we arrived, the ladies at... More
0	Disappointed. Arrived to discover an outrageous parking fee (also did not offer any disabled veteran discounts). Check in was ok until we discovered the entire college football team was arriving that night. The room was ok, the thermostat did not work so the room was very warm. It wasn't until later that night that the football enthusiastic kicked in and needless to say, we managed about two hours of sleep. You would figure the hotel would have informed us of this when we booked the room or at least would have had the decency to tell the rude guest to hold the noise down since it was after midnight. Needless to say I could not recommend this hotel to anyone else.
0	Horrible customer service!!. The individual by the name of John who worked the front desk was very rude on May 17, 2016.I would never recommend or stay at this hotel. My sister ended up just leaving without staying after she paid her money. I am calling the manager as soon as possible.
0	Poor service from start to finish. Stayed 1 night as an SPG Gold member through the Amex Platinum Fine Hotels Resorts program. The hard product at the property is good but let down by extraordinarily bad service - hands down the worst received at any 5* luxury hotel.- On reserving, the hotel insisted that as a couple with a young child, we must book a rollaway bed at an extra charge and we could not share one king bed for health and safety reasons. Accepting the higher rate charge, on arrival, there was no rollaway provided. Luckily we didn't want one but they were extremely insistent on this fact when booking.- No welcome amenity offered as SPG Gold member.- Check-in experience went from cold and marginally polite to confrontational. Hotel would not honor the contractual one-category if available upgrade of the Amex FHR program. The hotel's own website defines these room categories for sale: superior, deluxe, grand luxe rooms, then 1 bedroom suites. Within the 1 bedroom suite category, the room types are Astor, Deluxe, Madison. Having booked a grand luxe room, at checkin their website showed availability for Deluxe and Madison suites. The agent insisted their obligation was only a one-room type upgrade, and not a category upgrade (which means any room type in that category). Therefore as no Astor suite was available, no upgrade for us.- I spoke to the Front Desk Manager, Susan, who insisted their interpretation of the FHR contract was correct. Having now spent 20 mins waiting for them to check round the back as they put it, with nowhere offered for my family to sit, I just wanted to get to a room. I then called Amex, who contacted the hotel. Unfortunately by this point Susan had allocated the available Deluxe suites to other guests or at least blocked them, and lied to my Amex agent claiming that I had been seeking an upgrade to a Madison suite worth 1000 extra, and the contract prohibits a triple room type upgrade. I don't appreciate the hotel manipulating their inventory, nor lying to my Amex agent when my request was for a Deluxe suite allowable by the FHR contract and worth only approx 200-300 more. Amex advise the hotel clearly has different definitions of available and category and these do not equate to available for sale on their website and category of room as listed on their website - sounds like they are happy to use different definitions to deny loyalty benefits.- On being shown to our room, the agent advised a butler would introduce himself in a couple of minutes. One hour later, no butler. I page the butler and receive a call back, requesting a champagne ice bucket and child amenities (these weren't provided even though child was listed on the reservation). Another hour later, still no sign of anything. Page the butler again, received the amenities... never received the requested ice bucket. Last we ever saw of the butler. No offer of many of the complimentary services as advertised on their website, but nice of them to provide tea cookies/milk.- Ordered room service dinner (with the still missing ice bucket) - quality was very average for the price and beware families, this hotel charges an 8 per PERSON room service charge which I have never encountered at any other hotel. So a family of 3 would pay a whopping 24 in addition to mandatory 20 gratuity and sales tax. The waiter advised us just to lie and say we are just one person next time! Called for the trays/trolley to be collected, 90mins later nobody had come and it was collected by housekeeping at turndown.- Tried to organise family activities through the concierge as advertised on their website, they acknowledged our request but never heard back from them after that. - Advertised functionality to stream your iPad media to the hotel TV does not work.- Included complimentary breakfast worth 41 is the most basic continental breakfast ever seen, consisting solely of 4 pastries, coffee and one orange juice. - On checkout, the agent's only words from walking to the desk were Mr , here is your bill, let me correct this error, hope to see you again. No how was your stay or anything similar.When paying four figures to stay in a hotel room, this doesn't meet any expectations and this stay was our first and last at a St Regis.Dear msnz,Please allow us to thank you for posting your review on Trip Advisor. We understand that our Director of Rooms has connected with you privately and we hope you are satisfied with the resolution. We hope to be at your service again soon and, until then, please contact our executive office for any additional assistance you may need.Kind Regards,Hermann ElgerGeneral Manager
1	Great hotel and location in San Francisco. Stayed at the Hotel Zephyr for two nights. Whilst the hotel was going through a refurbishment and the lobby was very cramped and proved too small at times when large parties of guests arrived.... the rooms themselves were well equipped - had been refurbished to a good standard - on a nautical theme and generally were very comfortable. The staff were very attentive and provided a good level of customer care. Whilst the restaurant was undergoing refurbishment it really didn't matter as there was a good I-Hop next door for breakfast and within a couple of minutes walk you are right on Fishersmans Wharf which have some spectacular restaurants and attractions to visit. The location couldn't be faulted and I would certainly stay at the hotel again.
1	A very pleasant stay in PB, very good value for money. the hotel is right in the place to be at PB !board walk, people watching, sunset, beach, pier ! rooms are wide with a recently renewed bathroom Room decor should be renewed.the continental breakfast included in the room rate is convenient even if not particularly reach garage is convenient and not too expensivestaff is kind and helpfulwifi is not always working properly overall a pleasant stayThank you so much for all of your feedback, we are glad that you enjoyed your stay!

We look forward to welcoming you back soon!
1	Comfy location and friendly. We got a couple of connecting suites, very confortable and with all the necesary ammenities. Stayed there for a week. Contemporary and stylish.What we liked the most was the location right in the middle of down town where there is a good array of restaurants, its close to the Glass Lamp area and to the trolley.Service was very kind at all times. The food was ok but for some reason lacking a bit in salt to our latino taste buds. But the coffee great. Restaurant open at all times which is practical.One thing that should be handled is the dirty windows from the outside. That takes away from the aesthetics.I definitely give it a thumbs up because its a good value for the money.It sounds like the perfect vacation at Marriott Vacation Club Pulse! Thanks for sharing and we look forward to more vacationgreatness with your family.
1	Great Hotel near the Convention Center and Bourbon Street! M:). This hotel is conveniently situated near the Riverwalk Convention area as well as the Bourbon Street area. I walked from my hotel to both of these locations for a week. This hotel is clean, nostalgic, and accommodating. We received free drink cards upon check-in for drinks in the lobby from 530P to 7P. Although there are no restaurants in this hotel, they can get delivery of almost anything you can think of as far as food. The first night I was there, I was leary of walking to a nearby restaurant or Bourbon Street, but there was no need to be. This hotel is growing and has a brand new wing that will open in about 6-12 months. The construction commenced M-F starting at 7A, but no contruction on the weekends! I believe the cost was very good for the accommodations and service.
1	One of the best hotel rooms I've stayed in. I stay in a lot of hotels, especially for work, and I have to say, this was probably the best one overall, in terms of layout and provisions. My room was big (plenty of room for yoga). It had a large window, which had two blinds, one of which was blackout and in rails. This was amazing- it actually blocked the light out so I could sleep. It is actually very rare to find a hotel that has proper curtains or blinds that fully block the light out. The bed was comfy, and it had squishy feather/down pillows, which I love. The layout of the room was great- the fridge was under the sink not in the bedroom (great that there was a fridge) the shower space was large and actually had a shelf on which to put your bathroom products! Amazing! And amazingly useful! The shower space was large enough that you could turn it on and not get wet, and your shower products were not in the water, either. The room had a big TV on the wall opposite the bed, which had lots of pillows cushions to sit up on watch TV. The desk was a useful size, and had a plug hub (both electricity USB) (yay!). My only two gripes about the room were that there was no top sheet, which I find is far too common in Europe sometimes the USA, and I will never understand, because it can be too hot for a duvet and that there was only one towel hook in the bathroom, which would be awkward if you were two people. I did had to ask for more coat hangers, although that was no problem. I really liked that if you didn't get your room made-up, you got a voucher for the food/bar. That covered my brekky every morning! I did have some issue with noisy guests on my floor, but of course that's not the hotel's fault. The bar is pretty nice, with some very tasty drinks (pineapple chipotle margarita, anyone!) and a good atmosphere.
0	very poor service. It took at least 30 minutes to get checked in. then my key cards would not work. we went to a concert and showed back up at the hotel around midnight and the whole building smelled like poop. Just checked my bank account and they charged me twice for the room. not pleased at all
0	Paid more for a better nights sleep--- did not happen. We were planning a visit to the Corning museum of glass so figured we would pay more for a better bed and get plenty of sleep for our day long adventure. Was so dissapointed as the beds at this Hampton are not premium beds at all. This was by far the worst night sleep we had on our recent 10... More
0	From Bad To Worst!. This is my second stay here this year. Unfortunately, things have gotten worse. Sunday check in no towels. No shower curtain. No working ice machine in building one. Ice only available at the front desk. Seriously, my room was on the 4th floor at the end of building 1. By the time I got back to my room the ice... More
0	Don't bother.. Free parking. That's the only positive experience here. Any more than 1 night would have canceled found different hotel. Hotel had a funky smell in lobby and room was musty smelling too. Good thing the air conditioner was good and loud it blocked the street noise. Stayed at few holiday Inn express and they've been decent. Not so much here and they charge more rooms at the big H.I. Overall impression...not impressed.
0	Comfort suites. Dirty rooms. Outdated decor. Faulty lights. Bad odor. Terrible breakfast. Would not recommend or stay here again. Disgusting.
0	Shabby Place. Room service was an added cost - never saw that before. Changes actual room rate, from what was advertised - deceptive. Shower controls not secured to wall. Toilet see not tightened down. One light had to be unplugged to turn off, because switch was missing. In general, facility maintenance appears to be absent.
0	the worst hotel in America. My husband and I had to stay at this hotel for one night. I have never been to such a terrible place. I have been to the 3rd world countries, but have not seen such a shabby room. The room was disgusting (although the sheets seemed clean). The furniture had spots, tear, and looked like it was picked up off the curb. Nightstands and table had cigarette burns on them. The most terrible thing was that the room reeked of nicotine! I had a hard time sleeping because of the smell. When I got home I had to wash all my clothes. No one should stay in this hotel, unless for punishment! This hotel is a 4-floor building and the elevator is not working, which seems permanent. There is is no phone in the room, so if we had a problem, we needed to go downstairs and then back up.
0	Do not get park and fly!. The hotel is not bad. Staff is friendly. We have stayed at several times. This year we purchased park and fly package and left our car there while away on vacation. We returned to the hotel to find the vehicle had been broken into. The driver's side window had been shattered and someone tried to rip the door handle off. The hotel did cover the hole. We had to find a vacumn and vacumn the vehicle. Hotel did not offer. Had to drive 5 hours home without window through cold temperatures and some rain. They did call the police department. They came out took pictures etc. hotel apologized and refunded our room for the one night park and fly. Needless to say we will not be staying here again. We appreciate hearing from our guests and thank you for your feedback. We were very disappointed to hear your car was broken into while in our gated parking lot and understand how frustrating this is. Unfortunately, there has been a recent wave of car break-ins around the airport, affecting a number of hotels in the area. In the case of a car break-in, we contact and hand over to the local police department for further investigation. Fortunately with the help of local police and third party security monitoring our parking lot, we have been able to stop the vandalism. We work diligently to create a safe environment for our guests and will continue to work with local police to ensure our hotel, parking lot and city are safe. We offer our sincerest apologies and are glad we had a chance to discuss the situation with you directly. If you have any further questions or concerns, please let us know and we are happy to be of assistance.
0	Found 2 Cockroaches. Found two cockroaches, bed was basically springs and a sheet of cotton. No shampoo, and the was no drain stopper (PROBABLY WHERE THE COCKROACHES CAME FROM) i kept on waking up every hour just make sure that there were no bug on or around me. PLEASE DON'T STAY HERE luckily they were able to refund my second night. not worth itI recently received a copy of your review of our hotel.

0	Over Priced, Rooms Out of Date, and Noisy. Ok, so the Ritz is supposed to be Great , right. Not so here. I attended a networking conference in Atlanta and was quite surprised to find the rooms very expensive and outdated. First of all the building is old, not in a historical way,...More
0	Bad Hilton Garden Inn. Most Hilton Garden Inns are relatively new, and the service is usually great. This hotel on Stemmons Freeway near downtown Dallas was not at all like the other HG Inns I've stayed at. It was an older, run-down looking hotel that didn't live up to the HG Inn brand. The staff was generally unfriendly and unhelpful. We had a serious maintenance issue with our card key access panel, that was never resolved by the maintenance staff, and the front desk seem uninterested in the problem, and never seemed attentive to our needs. I'll still stay at HG Inns...just not this one.
0	if you want a guaranteed room reservation, don't try this hotel...and bugs. Arrived after a long trip. Got to the hotel after 11pm and discovered that even though I had a guaranteed reservation, there was no room waiting for me because they had overbooked the hotel. They walked me to a Fairfield hotel about 8 miles away (great staff but a tad nasty and very worn hotel). I wasn't the only one walked. At least four or five other people had the same experience I did at the same time (and according to the Fairfield clerk--a lot of people have this happen). Maybe this was a lucky break. When I took the Fairfield van back to the Marriott in the early morning for a meeting I had there I discovered, according to one guest, that he had experiencced strange bugs (bedbugs) in his room that night.....so perhaps a golden lining.
1	Try River Hotel!!! You'll be glad you did!!. I have visited Chicago often in the past and always have booked a different hotel.I am glad I changed this time and booked The River Hotel in Chicago.I was pleasantly greeted by a clean crisp modern room that offered plenty of space. I must also add that this is a green Hotel with lots of Green features built in.Some of the details of our stay included:Security system that only allows guests of that floor to enter that floor.Purified water provided at each floor.A coffee pot in the main room.... Not in the bathroom.A refrigerator and microwave.Luxury comforter.Comfortable chair that folds out into single bed.A greeting welcoming us on the voice mail system. A greeting giving us details about Sunday and late checkout.Available Ipads for guest use.The toiletries/ shampoo / lotion is high quality.The staff was friendly on checkout and there were no extra charges.This hotel provides a great room at a good price.Give this hotel a try!
1	Prom Pizzaz. We didn't stay overnight, but rented the room so that my daughter and her friends could get ready for prom a few blocks away. Just so everybody knows...her dad and I were in the room at ALL times; no kids were left unsupervised. Her date needed a place to get ready because he had performed at a nearby arts event that ran right into Prom time, so he needed someplace close. The staff was wonderful and very accommodating. We got some really wonderful pictures; my favorite was when the kids were reaching for the chandelier and it looked like they were reaching for falling stars. The staff helped us stage some really cool shots, and were just fantastic. The room was very clean and comfortable with plenty of mirror space and plug ins for curling irons; the window added lots of good, natural light. Lots of closet space let the kids get ready for after prom without too much problem.The only negative I have is that the hotel shuttle was not available, although when I called earlier in the week to make sure it was, I was assured that it would be available and that I didn't need a reservation. We had to scramble for rides to prom, which worked, but was a last minute stress we hadn't planned on having.
1	Great Hotel!. I'd recommend this hotel to any person, whether single, a family, or a couple. The staff were attentive, professional, and very helpful. When we arrived, our room was one of a smaller size, which the staff checking us in told us would be able to upgraded at no charge to us because we were staying so long! My girlfriend an I stayed at Hotel Diva for 10 days and loved every minute of it. Being in Union Square, this hotel offers a great amount of dining and theatre as well as easy access to other neighborhoods via bus or taxi. Excellent hotel!
1	Very Clean Renovated. Indoor Pool. This hotel surprised me. It was quite clean, and it was apparent that it had been renovated more recently than Marriott reported. The staff was very helpful. Very nice, clean indoor pool. Security guards in parking lot over the weekend.Thank you so much for your review, we are very pleased that you enjoyed your stay with us. We received several updates last summer, including paint, carpet, wall vinyl and new desk chairs. We did not perform a full renovation which is why the Marriott site will still show our last renovation in 2006. We encourage everyone to come and be suprised by the Fairfield Inn Suites Atlanta Buckhead, you'll be glad you did!
0	Never ever ever. In a word - awful. Called early in the day to ask for a late check in lady was very sassy and snarky rather than just making a note on the reservation. Once actually checked in: room extremely tiny, AC unit very loud, bed uncomfortable. Housekeeping knocked at 8am to clean room - checkout wasn't until 10am...
1	Very impressed with Quality Suites!. My wife and I recently spent a night at this property. We had never stayed at a Quality Suites property before. We came away very impressed. For our stay, at the end of May, it seemed the majority of the renovations had been completed. We received a complimentary room upgrade, thanks to Frederick Ross at the Front Desk. He was very helpful and very friendly.Our room was exceptionally clean and well appointed. The bed was firm and comfortable. Huge bathroom. There was a jacuzzi tub and even a gas fireplace.The Internet was fast and easy to hop on. The breakfast in the morning was also very good with a nice variety of hot items. It was easy to get to some very nice restaurants for a good meal as well.All in all we will now include Quality Suites in our list of choices for properties to stay at while traveling. An excellent value andDear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your comments regarding your recent stay with us. We work hard to insure our guest have a pleasant stay while they visit with us. We are pleases to hear we were able to exceed your expectations. We look forward to serving you again very soon.Kind regards,Laura Benson
1	Very good budget hotel in a great location. We stayed for seven days, as the basis for a holiday in San Francisco, with several trips around the Bay Area. For our purposes, it was the perfect hotel.It was booked via our travel agent, and when I afterwards saw previous Tripadvisor reviews, I was quite concerned. However, I'm really glad we weren't put off by them.It's clearly quite an old hotel, and we were staying in one of the motel-style rooms in the main part of the hotel. As Brits on holiday for the first time in America, it felt like lovely quaint Americana. The fittings and furniture were clearly new a good few decades ago, but everything was functional and clean. The staff were helpful and polite. The location is great for public transport - just a few minutes' walk to Market Street, and then you're right next to MUNI stops, and the Civic Center BART station, so travel around the city and beyond is very convenient.It's a very limited breakfast (but that's advertised), and a great bonus is that it's right next door to Sightglass - a lovely coffee roastery and coffee bar, if you want a good coffee to start the day. You're also right around the corner from two excellent craft beer bars - City Beer Store, and Cellarmaker.Being in the South of Market area (SOMA), you do feel you need your wits about you if out after dark, but it's the same in any city really.Overall, if you want a stylish hotel with modern fittings, this isn't it. But we wanted a budget hotel in the centre of the city for a holiday, and it was perfect for us.
1	Perfect for our needs!. We love the Lamplighter Inn in San Diego. Although it has a 'motel' look (two story buildings with outside doors) it is well maintained and has well kept grass, plants and flowers which give it a more friendly feel. There is a small but clean pool which is set up with beach chairs with towels on them for your convenience. There is a nice little breakfast set up (pastries, bagels, cereal and make your own waffles) served until 10am every morning. Its a great way to start the day and save a bit of money on food. We stayed in a suite which was very spacious (small sitting room with a pullout couch and then an attached room with a nice sided bed) and perfect for me, my husband and our young son (there's no door between the rooms - so don't look for privacy). One of the best features is Len - a member of staff at the hotel. He is very friendly, seems to know most everyone by their name and is a fount of information. We checked in daily with him for the scoop on things we were considering seeing. The only downside to the hotel is the location. Its not terrible - but its not a 'walking' friendly place. There are a lot of little local shops (drug stores, nail salons, that sort of thing) but nothing necessarily 'pretty' or tourist friendly places. That being said, it is very easy to get in a car and drive to many of main attractions of San Diego - and the staff is more than happy to give you driving information to them. Our original plan was to stay in Old Town (which after seeing we absolutely love!) but the hotels were sold out. If you're looking for a decent place to rest your head and are willing to hop in your car for short distances to get to places than I would recommend the Lamplighter.
0	Only if you cannot find another place!. Service was terrible. Never showed up with the corkscrew they said they would bring. Construction outside the room. Great if you want a 7:00am wake up call using a jackhammer! Otherwise nice hotel in a good location if you are coming or going from San Diego International.
1	Suncoast Hotel Casino is a great value in Las Vegas!. I visited the Suncoast Hotel Casino in Las Vegas last weekend and was pleasantly suprised. The rooms are clean and the rates are great!I live in Las Vegas for my second home, and many times I bring friends to gamble here in Las Vegas. They all can't stay at my home, so we usually look for a local hotel and casino to stay at that is affordable.The Suncoast had great restaurants, clean rooms and winning slot machines at a low price.The only drawback I had was that as a non-smoker, the casino needs better ventiliation. It was very smoky in the casino area.Highly recommended!William Mahoney
1	Pantai Inn, a gem on the ocean. Our family of 4 spent 3 nights at the Inn last week. Such a sweet location, friendly and helpful staff and well manicured grounds and accommodations. The breakfasts are a treat with the same attention to detail found in all other areas of the experience. Parking on the property is another added bonus. Just lovely, tranquil, perfect. It is a sad thing indeed to leave!Greetings 702kathryno,Thank you for taking the time to review Pantai Inn.I am so pleased that you and your family enjoyed our oceanfront Inn. Thankfully we are able to cater to groups large and small, families, couples, and individual travelers. I am sorry that you had to leave after 4 days, however it just means that you need to come back and visit us soon!Thank you for noting our teams attention to detail. We pride ourselves in ensuring that all of our guests needs are met and exceeded whenever possible. We are looking forward to making your next experience just as memorable as the one previous. See you soon.Mike
0	Poor Transportation. There was a lot of miscommunication between me and the hotel pickup service. I used the metro the entire time I visited D.C. When I would get back I would have to be picked up at the Franconia-Springfield station or else it would take the driver over an hour to come pick me up, even if it was near the hotel. Additionally, there was not shuttle to Reagan National Airport. I had a flight to catch at 6:00 AM so the metro was out of the question, since it doesn't run until 5:00 AM. The hotel couldn't do because it was too far away. They were promoting a taxi service that was going to charge 40 to get to DCA. I was not impressed with this taxi service when I needed a ride from near the Hilton Hotel to Best Western (this cabbie thought New Mexico wasn't part of the U.S.). So I did use Uber to get to DCA.
0	Do not stay here!!!. We had a reservation for late arrival. We arrived at midnight. Got in a barely acceptable room at 1:30 am. This was the 4th room. First room we woke a person already occupying the room. Second room they said was non-smoking but clearly not true. Third room the heater did not work. FINALLY the 4th room was ok. We let... More
1	Recommend. We have just left the Columbus Motor Inn after a 6 night stay and we would be more than happy to recommend it. As others have said, it isn't a 5 * hotel but it more than served its purpose for us. It could do with a bit of TLC but it was clean, tidy and had what we needed. 3 adults and 2 children shared a 2x queen bed room and there was plenty of room for us and our shopping. The bathroom could do with a bit of a refresh, but it was clean and we were happy to use it.. The staff were great..very friendly, even though they were having to work on Christmas Day!The location is fabulous, as is the free parking. We were a little worried as we are quite fussy about where we stay but we felt comfortable the whole time we were there. If you are staying here, you must eat breakfast at the Hollywood Cafe, about 2 blocks away. Yum!
0	Cheap and unresponsive. I'm a Hilton Gold member and was told on check in I could have a bottle of water each day during a busy two week stay. Keep in mind Kingsland water has a significant sulfur taste, so tap water is almost undrinkable. Later when I requested the water, I was told I had been promised something in error and would... More
1	Overall Good Stay. Location and overall quality are good. Rooms are clean, staff is exceptionally helpful. I have stayed here twice now and I will likely continue to return when I am back in San Francisco. As a solo traveler I put a high value on a sense of security and they really do a great job with that. Thank you for being a loyal guest of Hotel Diva. We are pleased to hear you find our staff to be exceptionally helpful! We really appreciate your feedback and will share this with our team. We look forward to seeing you next time you are in SF.
1	Good rooms, lounge is not open on weekends, no fridge in the rooms. Spent the weekend here. What I liked:- Good size rooms and clean with standard toiletries- Check-in and check-out process was smooth.- I did not order room service but looked at the menu and the food did not seem outrageously pricedFollowing are concerns in the hotel:- the conceirge lounge is not open on weekends. Was given a separate voucher for breakfast but you still can't get water, soda, or snacks in the evening.- the room did not have a fridge- this is not downtown chicago and charging 32 a night for car parking seems quite high- swimming pool is a combination of indoor and outdoor. The same and that was not encourag
0	Horrible Experience. 92.50 for the smallest, dirtiest, hideous,smoke smelling room I've ever stayed in. Management is white trash and extremely rude to customers. There is no reason to ever stay in this hotel, it's garbage and should not be open to the public.
0	The Worst. This hotel is like living in a construct zone. The hallways are not air cond and missing the baseboards. The room had chips in every wall. The bath tub has millldew stains around the edge. Hotel doors are not lock and in fact some could not be locked because the operating bar was missing. When I told them about the unsecured doors, the reply was that they had cameras. Breakfast was a joke - kids cerials, mini bagels and cupcakes with terrible coffee. Our flight was delayed a day and we checked out and used another hotel. Best description is it is run on the cheap. Shame on Ramada.
0	Rooms smelled. Well checked in was given room 183 couldnt stand the odor for more then 5 seconds.went to desk got a different room 153 was much better but still odor of mildew and mold.was given free breakfast which was ok.i wouldn't recommend to anyone unless i wanted to know what they thought of the place.Thank you for staying with us. We see that you have given us a rating of 1/5. With a mission to provide superior customer service, we take great pride in serving your needs and are sorry to hear that we have not met your expectations. As a valued guest, your feedback will be shared with the team to continue to inspire and motivate them to deliver exceptional customer service. We sincerely appreciate your feedback.
1	Excellent stay overall. Everything about our stay from the moment we checked in was a very positive experience. Our room was clean and had everything we needed. The pool area was also nice and clean with plenty of towels and loungers available. The breakfast area was also clean and well attended to. We were also given a one hour late checkout which made my daughter extremely happy as it gave her a chance for one more swim before we left. A perfect stay while we were in the Keys!Thank you for the five star review. So glad to hear our folks at the front office were able to extend a later departure so your daughter could get that one last swim!! Thank you for sharing your experience and we look forward to welcoming you back to our little island!
1	We would stay here again. We chose this hotel based on its TripAdvisor reviews and we were not disappointed. We stayed here for five nights with our two young children and visited the zoo, Balboa Park, Sea World and Coronado during our stay. The hotel was near the zoo/Balboa Park and was a reasonable distance from Sea World and the beach. El Cajon Blvd has many ethnic (Mexican, Thai, Vietnamese, Kosher) restaurants and the usual fast food chains. We did not see any restaurant chains such as Outback, Denny's, or Chili's near the hotel. There are several grocery and drug stores nearby. We felt safe walking around the neighborhood with our kids.Our room was clean with updated bedding and furniture and had a fridge and microwave. It was not large, but adequate for our needs. We did not have any problems with noisy neighbors or noise from the street during late-night hours. The free continental breakfast was good. The only thing I found missing was yogurt. We asked for advice and directions from the front desk several times and they never led us astray. We also purchased discount zoo tickets from the front desk. We used the pool once and it was fine.I agree with another reviewer that it is just a motel. However, we spent less than 100/night here and we were happy with our choice.

1	Location, location, location!. The Saint is about as well located as any place in key west. There are 2 (hidden) side entrances/exits as well as the main one on Eaton street. if you use a gps, DO NOT enter the Duval street address -- you will end up going in circles.Main entrance is up a few steps. you can park in front for 15 minutes, and if you have luggage, go inside and ask for help.room 113 is on the main floor, and mostly dark since the shutters need to be kept shut during the daytime (there is a busy walkway right outside and anyone can see in -- for same reason, it can be a bit noisy at times)the entire property is funky, in a playful way. photos on this site will show you why.staff is friendly and anxious to please. any major problems should go to the general manager, abraham, who is eager to make the hotel as good as possible.oh, the location. no car is needed. you are 5 minute walk to truman white house, 10 minutes or less to mallory park/sunset pier. also greene street is the same area and has a lively night life as well as key lime pie stores every few steps.hemingway house is towards the other end of Duval street, but can be reached in less than 20 minutes if you don't stop at all the stores and eateries along this main street. go another 10 minutes or less, and you will be at the end of Duval, and reach the southernmost point in the continental u.s. -- where the famous buoy sits. you may need to wait on line a few minutes to take a photo at that spot. also, a great cafe right on the beach there. finally, for dinner, you can almost throw a dart and find a terrific place within walking distance of the saint. have fun!Dear ischloss,We greatly appreciate that you took the time to write such a thorough review about your recent stay at The Saint Hotel Key West. We hope that when your travels bring you back to Key West, you will once again choose The Saint and give us another to earn that 5-star rating!Cheers!
1	Can there be a 10!. I love the St Regis (generally speaking but especially the New York). I've stayed here 12 times over the last 4 years or so. It just seems to get better each time. Tire's a great new feature which is the Rooms control Manager (Molly) emailing me ahead of time to see when we would be arriving. My SPG upgrade available when we arrived at about 1015AM which is rare these days. Then there is the front desk staff - they are all wonderful but I want to call out Shelomie and Hugo who know Ryne and I by name and immediately make us feel at home. How about that concierge desk - again all are great but today I'll call out Krista and McKinley. I emailed while on the plane about getting in to the Salon for Mani and a shave. Our appointments were made and ready for when we arrived. Our Butler this trip was Marianna. She is awesome and gave us the utmost service during our stay. Finally Kevin and Juan our In Room dining attendants - just as perfect as can be. I named names because this is what this place is about. Consistent and friendly staff that makes The St Regis our home away form home. We really love it.Dear Kenneth,Thank you so much for taking the time to not only share your feedback regarding your most recent visit, but also to be so detailed and generous with your comments about our team members. Molly, Shelomie, Hugo, Krista, McKinley, Marianna, Kevin, and Juan are indeed amongst our most stellar performers and we could not be happier to learn that they made your and Ryne's visit enjoyable and memorable. Rest assured that they will receive the well-deserved recognition.Please come back soon! We want to be your home away from home many more times to come!Happy New Year!!!Daniela on behalf of All Your SRNY Friends

1	20th Wedding Anniversary spent in style with the Ritz Carlton, Central Park. Celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary, we were treated like royalty at the Ritz Carlton Central Park. One of the best service experiences and friendliest hotel staff ever! When we walked in to the hotel, we were immediately greeted by our last name. We were given a great room overlooking the park with a complimentary bottle of wine, warm greeting and congratulations by the staff. The bellman on staff Jose, was incredibly nice and full of good information for the area around the hotel. Make sure you have a cocktail at the Star Lounge. We met one of the city's most famous bartenders, Norman. He made us his favorite cocktails to celebrate with - what an interesting person! If you go for an anniversary - make sure you mention it. The hotel loves to have guests celebrating special events. Thank you Ritz staff for making it special!
0	Hot Water and Internet issues. Not up to HHonors standards. Beautiful property, nice rooms and bath room nice clean carpets and bedding / bed comfort. But, NO HOT WATER for 25 minutes - each morning. Yes, we were told to wait 20+ minutes for the hot water to get up to the room level. And, the internet didn't connect, so we (my traveling partner - in another room) had to use the 'staff' WiFi with their password.Thank you for taking the time to share this feedback and we do apologize for not meeting expectations during your recent stay. I will review all aspects of design and address accordingly to ensure our guests enjoy their time as our guests. The boiler at our hotel did experience a mechanical issue that we addressed as quickly as possible but this did however cause our guests to experience no hot water for a period of time. Please know that this was not due to anything other than bad luck and timing. Our boiler is very new and plenty big enough for our hotel, this was an isolated issue that has been corrected moving forward. We are however happy to hear that you felt safe and secure while staying with us and do hope to have you back as our guests the next time you travel to New Orleans. Sincerely,
0	Motel was awful, service and location was good!! 2 night stay room 206. On check in we were greeted by a very helpful receptionist called Alex, unfortunately the rooms did not match up to the service ( the rooms were very old and decor was very dated, wallpaper from the late 80s. Room had a very strange smell and curtains did not reach the bottom of the ledge so the light from the car park flood lights were beaming straight through the window!!! The pillows were dreadful and the bed was so uncomfortable, we felt unsafe in this motel as well, walls paper thin and doors slammin constantly , very noisy outside too- i know this is not the hotels fault but just adds to the awful stay we had. we paid around 85 per night for this hotel which may seem reasonable for location, however we stayed at the coventry motor inn just up the road and it was by far do much better than the Francisco bay inn.Overall good location and staff but dirty, noisy, dated , smelly motel rooms!!!! Better motels in the area for same price!!! Not recommended
0	Try Another hotel.... We arrived in San Francisco on the Friday, did some sight seeing, bought souvenirs, We eventually got to the hotel around 9pm, we parked on the street just minutes away from the hotel, there were a few homeless people in the streets and didn't think too much of it, Next morning we went to our rental vehicle only to see it was broken into and a few of our belongings were stolen, The front desk was helpful in calling the police for us to get things sorted out. The next night we chose to pay for the valet service at 35.00 a night. because once we did more driving around we realized it was a very bad neighbourhood, not child friendly or even adult friendly for that matter . The hotel offered coffee and juice and the morning and this was not very good. Overall was not enjoyable to stay
0	One Bad Experience - GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. I had stayed there before and gave them a positive review. However, when I went back, they had changed management. The staff is very negative, incompetent, and nasty. There is no shortage of drama. I went 4 weeks without any housekeeping and then the new manager blamed me. I am now staying in another place for now without any drama and my room is cleaned DAILY! Please don't put yourself through this - GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!
1	Great Location. Stayed for a weekend trip in Chicago. Hotel is in the perfect location in the city centre. Walking distance to Millennium Park. Great room - compl. upgraded was provided to us so we had 2 queen beds and 2 bathrooms so the room was very spaces and was always kept clean. Complimentary water bottles are refill stations on every floor as well as coffee on level 2. Staff is amazing and have great advice on restaurants and places to visit. Only issue with my room was that it looked out towards trump tower - not exactly what you want to wake up to each day.Hello Helen D,Thank you for choosing Chicago River Hotel during your recent travels. We are delighted to hear you enjoyed your complimentary upgrade and enjoyed the extra space. We are very lucky to be right in the middle of the city and within walking distance to all major attractions. We are also glad to hear you found the staff to be amazing as we pride ourselves on our service. We look forward to seeing you again next time you come to Chicago!
0	Once was Enough. After reading the mixed reviews I wanted to give this one a try. I stayed 2 nights before moving to Park Vue. The room was a king, very small, and fixed up, but it looked fixed up. Some parts you could tell was old. It was clean and ok for the location. I paid 74.98 each night. If I had a car I would have stayed at Motel 6 instead for about 50.00 a night and it is nicer and larger than Del Sol. When I arrived I wasn't to impress with front desk. He had run my credit card already before I arrived for one night. Most run it when you arrive. I did want to use a different card, and he started to run it - then told me he had run the other. I got the slip and made sure I tore it up, so I wouldn't get double charge. The room is definitely blah, but I didn't expect lots for what I was paying. I wanted to compare it and the Park Vue. I would only go back to Del Sol for the location and only if I could for some reason not afford the Park Vue. I have seen Del Sol priced as high as 100 night on the web. That is way too much. Even the jazucci at Park Vue with great planning far in advance was only 108.00 a night and the King or double queen can be as low as 81.00.I personally think this room at Del Sol would have been good for 1 person. I couldn't imagine being closed in with kids. I won't be returning, but if you get a 50.00 price and want clean and don't mind being no breathing space go for it - the location is good, but Park Vue is also closer.If possible no matter where you stay book as early as you can. The closer it gets the higher the room goes. I already booked for next year Park Vue jacuzzi suite for 98.00 in August.Happy Planning......
0	Worst Hampton Inn stay. We stay at Hampton Inn's often as they are usually decent and affordable. This was our worst experience by far. The room was not clean with visibly dirty pillow cases/sheets and a bath tub that would not drain. The breakfast was also not as quality as our other stays with a dirty serving area and uncooked eggs and sausage. The staff overall was nice and they did appropriately respond to our concerns but we will not be back.Dear Heather, TThank you for staying with us and your time and comments Please accept our sincere apologies for the drain in your room not be working properly. We appreciate your letting us know. The comments that youve raised concerning the items have been addressed with our staff, and I thank you for bringing them to our attention. Please accept our apologies for your inconvenience. Hilton Honor points have been issued to be put back into your account. We know that you have many choices to stay while in the area and we appreciate that you stayed with us. Sincerely, Patricia KilgoreGeneral Manager

Arrived at 6pm staff has no idea what rooms are clean and what is not have reservation for a king size room trying to give me a double queen finally have found me a king room more to follow. Ok we got an upgraded king room has a pull out bed also. Room is clean and looks good. Well we... More
1	Good central location. Being a Hyatt Globalist, Hyatt is generally number 1 on our list when choosing hotels. The Hyatt at the Belleview died the disappoint although some minor things were a little bothersome. Overall we received great service from the team, starting with the really efficient and friendly lady that checked us in, she was great. We were given a complimentary suite upgrade on the basis of my status which was great. The room was huge, nicely laid out with a big living room and separate bedroom. 2 things bothered me about this suite, 1) the room itself was very dark, facing the inner courtyard there was practicallly no natural light and not enough lighting and 2) the bathroom was really small.The hotel is part of a Grande olde dame of a building that has been restored nicely to its former grandeur, this is also evident in the wrought iron staircases, wonderful ceilings and art spread throughout the hotel. Breakfast at XIX was good but not great - standard selections on the buffet that could be expanded a little - this was free as part of the Globalist status but does come up short when compared to other Hyatt hotels, but decent in any case. The hotels location is great if she our ein town to explore the city and its sights and museums, pretty much everything is walking distance.All in all this was a good hotel, if we ever get back to Philly we'll be basing ourselves there again.Thank you for your loyalty, and for choosing Hyatt at The Bellevue during your recent visit to Philadelphia! We view feedback as a gift and we appreciate your constructive ideas. Our Management staff have been notified of these suggestions regarding the guest rooms and the breakfast offerings. Thank you again, and we hope to see you again very soon!Kindest regards,Michelle G.
1	Such a great hotel!. We had a wonderful 5 day stay here! We enjoyed everything about this hotel. The staff was friendly, housekeeping was great, the grounds were well kept and constantly being worked on while we were there. The breakfast was exceptional. Its close to beaches and San Diego attractions I would absolutely recommend this Marriott and stay here again and again. Thanks for a great stay!Thanks for the top score review. I am confident that future travelers to San Diego and to our hotel will find your review very helpful. Please come back and see us again in the future.Regards,Jonathan CorrellGeneral Manager
0	Horrible!. The room smelled terrible of smoke even though it said no smoke hotel. There were ashes on the floor! And drunk men wandering around outside! The the hallways had trash in them. It was dirty and unclean!
0	Need to be more cleaner. Rooms wasn't cleaned hair was ever where on the desk and table. Yall need someone to check behind the maids! Simple as that. Thought it was nicer for the location wasn't pleased at all and will never stay there again.We are truly sorry to hear that you did not have a pleasant stay with us. I will address all of the issues that you stated with our staff so that we can make improvements. We really appreciate your feedback and will use it to make sure that future guests have a much better experience.
0	Vacation. This hotel is located in a quite area. Within the location of this hotel it offers awesome stores options if you are in need of additional clothing or grocery store items. I've stayed at this location on several occasions but I must say this visit did not rate anywhere near my previous stays. The water in the tub backed up which is gross and unsanitary. The surface in the tub is very slippery which should have better surfacing inside the tub. These experiences has caused me to seek future overnight/weekend stays at other 4 or 5 star hotels in the surrounding area. We went for coffee in the breakfast area, but the coffee seemed to have included undesired coffee grinds, we then chose to go out for breakfast after notifying the staff.
1	Very pleased!. This was a business trip for 3 nights chosen for it's very close proximity to where I had to attend a business class. Valet parking was very quick efficient, both coming going. The desk clerks were very friendly, efficient and accommodating. The room was sparkling clean and nicely appointed (I was in the older part but couldn't have asked for a better room). My room faced Poydras, so may have been a little better view than other parts of the hotel. I was pleasantly surprised that the bathroom/vanity area had very nice bright lighting and the water pressure and hot water were excellent. Nice extras - 3 complimentary alcoholic drinks and a nice assortment of foods during the 5:30-7pm evening cocktail/food period.. meatballs, ziti pasta, hot dogs, chips, cheese dip, salad bar, chicken fingers, baked potatoes, etc. in a nice large open area to dine, so even though there were many people taking advantage of this, it wasn't uncomfortably crowded and the food bars were well-attended. Though I did not get the opportunity to see much of the city, it was definitely within walking distance of the riverwalk area and the French Quarter. I definitely will stay here again.
1	Excellent Place Near the French Quarter!. My husband and I stayed at this hotel the weekend before Mardi Gras. I was a bit apprehensive because of some reviews but overall I was pleased. The staff was very nice and helpful. We left our room early in the morning and several days near noon and upon our return our room was nice and tidy. We had a jacuzzi suite and it was quite spacious...enough room for much more than two people. There are two full size closets, mini fridge, flat panel TV, livingroom, and separate bedroom. The short walk to the French Quarter was nice and there is a Domino's just around the corner for an evening snack...or there are many nicer places that deliver to the hotel. Maybe the only little thing that kind of bothered us was the view. I am not sure if all jacuzzie suites are situated in the back corner of the hotel but our view was faced west and consisted primarily of two brick walls bordering the parking lot and some buildings off in the distance. Since we didn't spend much time in our room, the view did not bother us much. It was our first trip to New Orleans for some of the Mardi Gras festivities and we look forward to staying here again in the future.
0	not as I requested. We requested 2 beds. We got only one. There was a recliner positioned in a strange place in the room. The room was for handicapped people so the shower had a seat in it and a hand held shower head. Not tall enough to stand under.
0	They charged me twice!. Yesterday Sunday March 27, I reserved a one bed room for one night and later I upgraded my reservation for a room with two beds because my daughter was coming with us. Now I have been charged for two rooms! I want you to reimburse me my money!
0	BED BUGS. Woke up to many red, itchy bites all over my body. I'm so disgusted. Front counter guy was very rude noisy children laughing talking in the middle of the night. Stayed in room 223 in the bed closest to the window, so If you have to stay here-- make sure it's not in that room.
1	Awesome stay. The staff was excellent, the room was nice and clean. The hotel was very modern. The bed was so comfortable. The breakfast buffet was awesome and the omelets are to die for. One of the best stays I've ever had. Thank you for your amazing remarks regarding your recent stay at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport. It is wonderful to read that you enjoyed your contemporary accommodation, amenities we provide and the hospitality of our associates. We are delighted that you got a great nights sleep as well. It is also pleasing to hear that you relished the breakfast buffet we serve at the Garden Grill restaurant. I will share your gracious feedback with my team and congratulate them for a job well done. Thank you again, and we hope that you and your family will return soon to the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport for another fantastic experience. All the Best,Debra Thompson-FrenchGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport
0	Roosters will wake you up at 3:30am daily. Use of ear plugs is futile.. This is a nice location, close to good local food and excellent snorkeling with nice beaches close by. The host is kind and prepares a nice breakfast. The room is in a tin roof shed with screened openings. The farm doesn't appear to have had any work done in the last ten years but despite that the mature trees have... More
0	Beautiful View Of Harbor. Nice view that is it the staff was not friendly at all, when we came in the staff acted like what the hell do you want, all they cared about was did we have a reservation well sorry to say we did, would have rather stayed at a no tell motel, the room was dirty and needs updates the cost for a place to sleep was awful for such a dump the view was the only good thing about this hotel,so save your money sleep in your car. Will never stay in a Best Western Again.I would like to apologize for the inconvenience.Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you gave us to implement improvements to ensure we offer a better experience for guests in the future. I hope that you will consider staying with us again so that we can have another chance to provide you with a superior experience.
0	Good location, hotel needs to be updated. We requested 4 non smoking rooms. When we checked in we only had 2 non smoking and the hotel was sold out. My of thr rooms we had to kill a roach. Another room I was personally bite up from some type of black bug. They treated my room and offered to move me to there other location which was an inconvenience. The carpet in all of our rooms was dirty and mine was dirty and torn. One of the rooms had a 90 dollar charge under Other which the hotel could not explain so they removed it. And when they were checking my bed to see what was biting me, it was particulars on the box spring that did not belong to me. So how was that possible if they had put on new linen prior to me coming. I would not recommend this hotel nor would I return. They did give me two night comp stay for another location for my troubles but I dont beleive it was enough.
0	Poor service, Indifferent GM. I stayed here for two nights booked through FHR. The room itself was fine, but the front desk and check-in experience undermined the entire stay. I contacted the GM, but he never responded to or acknowledged my concerns.We were upgraded on arrival according to the FHR benefits, but the sitting area of the room had no furniture. We returned to the desk, and I was offered a room with two beds. I told them that would be fine if they were queen beds, and they said that they were. They were not (and they don't seem to have any rooms with queen beds according to their website).After waiting for 45 minutes, I was told that I would not be receiving an upgrade because I had accepted and didn't like the second room. I told them that I accepted on the condition that beds were queen sized, which was untrue. Eventually an adequate room was found for me.There are a lot of things to like about the MO Miami, but I simply did not feel like a welcome guest. The lack of response from the GM suggests that they take no issue with the level of service they are failing to provide.Dear Guest,Please allow me to personally extend my sincere apologies for the disappointing experience during your last stay at Mandarin Oriental, Miami. I am very sorry about the turn of events that you encountered and the manner in which it was handled. I assure you I did review the email you sent to my attention and addressed the incident with the front office management team I again apologize for the poor first impression and to compensate for the inconvenience, ask you to please contact the Executive Office for assistance with your next reservation. I assure you that your next stay will be seamless and enjoyable.I am at your service for any future assistance.Sincerely, Jorge GonzalezArea Vice PresidentGeneral Manager
0	Another bad experience. This is the worst Hampton Inn we have stayed in so far this trip. Drapes didn't close,so I had lights in my eyes all night. Control panel on AC didn't work, could only get cold or heat and that blew the flimsy curtains open. Nightlight wasn't working. Candy machine had melted candy. WiFi was extremely complicated to get on and... More
0	EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. We stayed at La Hacienda because it was close to the SafeCo field and we had to get to a Mariner's game. We decided it was only for one night and we would leave immediately int the morning. The service was bad, with non-english speaking staff. The shower and sink did not drain and when we complained to the employees they did nothing to fix it. The carpet was dirty, there were spots on the wall where the wallpaper was ripping off and they had tried to patch it. The TV didn't work and there were creepy people hanging around the parking lot. The next day we discovered there were bedbugs in the beds, as one member of our group had gotten bitten in quite a few places. It was certainly not worth the money.
1	A must stay for the price. Amazing it was the very best I could have stayed or do business in at San Diego. I am most impress as I don't really stay at a lot of great hotels like the best Western. First la jolla, next Mission Valley. I'm sure I'll be staying here again. and in different locations.Dear Floyd: Thank you for providing us with feedback on your recent stay. The Best Western Seven Seas in San Diego is grateful for your kind remarks and glad that you enjoyed the value received. We thank you for choosing us for your hotel accommodations and look forward to welcoming you back on your next trip whether for business or pleasure!Most Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff
0	Tired old Hotel in the wrong side of town. Picked this Hotel, because it was within walking distance of a concert venue my mistake (I should have done more research). Sadly, the area is not the best (within one block east south there are considerable numbers of poor unfortunate people living on the sidewalk, in tents, in cardboard boxes and cars). Although, we did not have any trouble whatsoever we did witness open (injected) drug use on the street. Some may call it edgy or off the tourist track. Certainly not a place for families with young children to visit. During our visit we met a retired SF Social worker who told us Hyde St. (300s) is one of the dirtiest locations in the city and a good many of this former clients came from around that area.The hotel building (c.1904) was clean inside and the staff more than helpful. Out first room, on the fourth floor, although a double, was a disappointment very small and cramped, no draw space, tiny shower room, single glazing, overlooking the main street, very noisy (there is an Emergency Hospital directly opposite with vehicles coming in though-out the night).Our second room (floor two) was much larger, with ample cupboard/draw space and a bath and was situated at the rear of the building clean, but, again a little tired.There are a few places to eat nearby again, some care would be needed, not to go down the wrong street.The nearest public transport (Cable Car on the California line) is two blocks to the north and a 20minute ride will connect you with the downtown financial district.Pros: Price!Cons: Location.Visit Again: No, sadly, the adjacent area is too distressed.We were pleased to host you during your stay in San Francisco, and we hope that you enjoyed your trip to the city. It is also good to hear that the hotel itself was good, and we trust that you rested well. We know that the homelessness that is evident throughout the city can be very disconcerting for those who are not used to it, and we are sorry that you found aspects of this to be so off-putting. Please know that this is replicated throughout the city. Thankfully, our guests are never approached by people, and despite appearances, our area is very safe. Our building and some of our furniture are quite old, but we trust that you noticed the wonderful standard of cleanliness and upkeep that we maintain, and we hope that this did not detract from your stay too much. Overall, we are sorry that you did not enjoy your time here more. Best wishes, Hotel Management
1	Slice of Paradise. From the time you arrive at the front desk your eyes are filled with so much to take in and appreciate to the staff doing everything they can to answer any question you may have and make your stay wonderfull. Then you get to your room and are pleasantly surprised on just how much care and effort was put in to match the location of the old town feel. Great jobExcellent review and comments. We know that any great hospitality experience starts with smiled and in so pleased this carried through to your entire stay. The hotel design was inspired to match the vintage charm of Old Town thank you for noticing the care we put into it. We hope you'll consider our Best Western your home away from home when visiting San Diego. Until next time, happy travels! Regards,Ryan AguinaldoGeneral Manager
1	Amazing experience and location! Couldn't have picked a better hotel than the Kinzie. Bad: I wanted to watch Netflix and couldn't, BUT THEY SAID NETFLIX WAS COMING!! By the end of August the hotel is getting new TV system to watch my shows! So my one negative will be fixed!!. Good: The staff was amazingly friendly! Breakfast was on each guest room floor and got to have breakfast in bed!! Free food and drink in the lounge every night. It was so easy to get around the city. Most of it was within walking distance, but I took the L to Wrigley Field. Super Easy! Free Wifi as well.
1	Lovely. A lovely old finished hotel with great staff who upgraded our room after booking.com cancelled our reservation without notifying us. We ended up in a huge suite with a beautiful big comfortable king bed and a kitchenette and separate living area. We also had three toilets. Our adult sons unfortunately had to share a king bed between them in their own room but they were happy. Good location, in the middle of a great spot in town. No breakfast available there and no pool or gym unfortunately. Dear erica6634,Thank you so much for taking your time to share your comment with us on TripAdvisor and giving us a 5 stars ranking. I am so happy to hear you enjoyed your stay with us in our Royal Suite after a little incident with your booking, and I am glad we were able to make up the situation. We hope you will see you again during your next visit in San Francisco. Thank you for staying with us.
0	would stay here again. This hotel is just ok. The rooms are decent but nothing more. The pool is small but I guess adaquate for kids. The walls are paper thin and we were awake every night by people walking in the room above. If you want quiet choose a room on the 3rd floor and away from the pool. The complimentary breakfast is just ok also. I love my breakfast and this was not that good at all. Eggs and sausages were not edible. At least there was cereal and milk. The location is good as there are several big shopping malls around. The zoo and sea world are close also. Ralph's grocery store is also not far. You do need a car in san diego though.
0	Business Travelers with corporate rate BEWARE. This property is nice and clean in an off the beaten path area of Seattle. If you're trying to book a room with a corporate rate, beware. I've been staying here just about every week for the last 9 months, and they still blackout corporate rates every chance they get. They refuse to honor customer loyalty, and make booking rooms here consistently impossible. They like to charge you more for the executive level, which is a load of garbage because they're just rooms at the top of the hotel with free cereal and water bottles. I'll be glad when I don't have to stay at this property anymore, just because of how difficult they make the booking process. I've had to stay outside the city and drive over 1 hour each way because they refuse to honor corporate rates at random times. The staff isn't great. it's almost like they have this attitude that they're a top of the line luxury hotel in Seattle, which isn't the case. Definitely wouldn't recommend this property to business travelers. If you're a family and can throw down some serious cash for an unimpressive hotel in a crappy part of town then go for it.Dear bpcole,I am so sorry that you were dissatisfied with your stay. Please contact us directly at the hotel. We can further discuss your experience. You may call us at 206 254 0500. Ask for the Manager on duty and we will be happy to try to make it right.Regards,
0	Horrible treatment by hotel staff: worst ever!. I travel on business nationwide constantly, and I'm gold level for most chains: now I know why I don't stay at Sheratons often. Their location on Bourbon Street is bad enough. It took my 1/2 to go one block due to all the drunk revelers walking in the street, and the GPS didn't know what to do. By the time I got to the front desk, I was tired to the point of tears, and the front desk staff were cold, unfriendly and rude. As it turns out the Starwood computer system messed up and showed me as arriving the next night. Despite seeing a well dressed, exhausted middle aged woman asking for help, the front desk lady just looked at me and said, loudly, You're here on the wrong night!looking at me as though I were an idiot. She made NO effort to find me room, NOR did she even offer to call another hotel to get me a room, even though it was almost midnight, for my plane had been delayed three hours!!! I started crying (!) and went back out to get my car from the valet,. I have NEVER been treated so poorly by a hotel: ever! I had to sit in my car with my cell phone charging, calling hotels for a room. Stay away from this property! I called the next day trying to get the manager, and was put on terminal hold, so I hung up.Dear TripGypsi, We are very disheartened to hear of your disappointing experience at our hotel as it is very important to us to make our guests feel welcomed. Our General Manager, Beth Ables, would love the opportunity to personally rectify your experience. Should you like, please contact her directly at b.ablesfourpointsfrenchquarter.com to further discuss your stay. Again, we are very sorry and hope we can make this experience up to you. All the best.
1	Best Deal for the Price!. Looked for an overnight on a long journey so just wanted a clean, quiet, comfortable room at the cheapest price available and this establishment met those requirements for us. It's an excellent deal at a very excellent room rate. Loved our king size bed and tv and robust wifi. Very quiet,quick check in, clean surroundings. Obviously the management is quite particular about appearances as this is unusual compared to other Red Roof Inns we have seen. We picked it because of the other reviews and are impressed that the management responds to each review. That's personal attention! Our check in person was just neutral until I began a conversation. I think a welcome smile and greeting should be a given, but that is my only recommendation. Overall, for the price this hotel is exceptional.
0	In bad need of repair and customer service needs improving. I don't mind old hotels as they can have a quaint charm about them. But the Bertram is in dire need of some TLC. When checking in (I was here for a wedding), the staff failed to provide me the gift that the bride had prepared for her guests. The desk staff was pleasant but moved on to the next... More
1	Perfect location. We love staying here as the location is fantastic. Very laid back with a good vibe. We stayed 7 nights and loved our room. The only issue that didn't make it a five star stay was that the WiFi was down for 3 days. This made it difficult to book restaurants, check our flights and generally keep in touch. The hotel seemed lost over the issue and didn't communicate the problem to their guests. The staff were efficient and friendly and we can't wait to go backThank you for taking the time to share your experience staying at the Outrigger Reef Waikiki Beach Resort and for the high recommendation. I am glad that you had a great stay. Please accept my sincere apology for the lack of service. We are taking the necessary steps to prevent similar situation and your feedback is being shared in our daily briefing. Thank you once again for taking the time to write this review. Aloha
0	Horrible. I will never stay here again. No elevator. We were located on the second floor, not handicap accessible. I'm not handicap but it's doing a real number on my knee. Sheets are yellow. Cigarette burns in a non-smoking room. Smelled musty. Stains on the chair. Mold on the ceiling above the bed. Dust and cob webs behind the chair. T.V.... More
1	Great Experience. We wanted to take a quiet moment to thank you and the staff at the Grande Colonial for an extraordinary stay. The staff was professional and attentive, the facility had old world charm with modern amenities and the food and drinks were a delight.Thank you, Jccwins. We appreciate you taking the time to post feedback here on TripAdvisor. Our staff and the warm, gracious, and genuinely-friendly service they provide is our greatest asset. And I am so happy to see that reflected in your review. We look forward to welcoming you back again in the future. Best regards, Terrence Underwood, General Manager
0	Avoid this property. Staff was rude, hotel is dirty, no hot water, questionable neighborhood. Was one of the worst hotels I have visited. The low rate is not low enough. Would not recommend under any circumstance. Pay the extra fifty dollars a night and stay at the Courtyard.
0	Empty promises. Stayed here after a long flight was supposed to be for two days. But lasted one night. Was in room 210 but complained after first night due to noise from being next to the elevators and the air conditioning unit at the window and on the roof outside. Staff were indiferent to the problem said they couodnt help as the hotel was full. (All flights from NYC and Washington Area were cancelled due to storms so in bound passengers didnt arrive) the room card offered complete satisfaction or money back but this was not honoured as apoarently we had paid in advance. I assume the money that came out of my bank was coverted to play money by the time they got it so the guarantee was invalid!!!! I asked for a taxi and got their mini bus who charged 50 to go downtown. I was conned into this hotel by the Hilton brand name huge mistake on my part.Hi,We are sorry we were not able to provide you with the quality of services you deserve.

0	Website Misleading and Not Guest Friendly. Had checked the website for this motel and the pictures displayed were not as the motel itself really is. Booked two rooms for two adults and two children in each room. Upon arrival at the hotel the front appeared to be in good order but after that things started to break down. The walkways had not been cleaned for sometime... More
0	Yeah Baby!. Older hotel in dire need of updating. I expected to see Austin Powers come out of the bathroom.
1	Rooms as nice as Hilton, third of the cost. Same location. Missing only nice lobby and toiletries.. The rooms are actually really nice and updated. The common areas are older and outdated, but rooms are surprisingly nice. Motel 6 immediately next door to Hilton and Marriott Marquis, but a third the price.Nice new fridge and microwave in room. My dog was allowed at no extra cost. Room was quiet. Couldn't hear hallway noise. If you don't mind missing the extra common area atmosphere, swimming pool, pricey restaurants, etc and just want a clean safe modern room with all the necessary amenities and free parking, come here. Free parking in downtown Atlanta is unheard of. Gave cleanliness a 4 cuz comforter smelled musty, but everything else was perfect. Overall a 4 cuz of no extras besides the nice room and free parking.
1	Would stay here again!. Having read some terrible reviews of this hotel, l was slightly worried about staying here with my family. However, l can honestly say that it was our best holiday ever! Okay the hotel and rooms could do with a refurb but it was clean and comfortable. For the money you pay, you cannot expect 5* service so if you just want somewhere comfortable to collapse at night after a day in the parks/shopping, this hotel is great. The hotel's location is excellent. You can walk to Universal in about 15 mins (or call the free fun spot bus to pick you up - reception will do this for you for free), Wet and Wild is opposite the hotel, loads of restaurants are in walking distance (or you can jump on the i-trolley). All the parks are easily accessible from this hotel. If you want to use the wifi, you can only do this in the lobby or by the pool (some of the rooms near the lobby can pick it up if by the window). The breakfast is basic but fine, you can have frosted flakes, corn flakes, toast (toasters do take forever though), tea, coffee and orange juice. If you want something else you can pay for pancakes etc or just pop across the road to Sizzler for an all you can eat buffet (3.99 pp). There are lots of good places to eat on international drive, we really enjoyed Chilli's and Uno. There is also a great takeaway pizza place across the road from the hotel. Being a vegetarian in Florida was a bit awkward as they really love their meat (our waitress in Chilli's had never served a vegetarian before) but most places have basic foods like veggie burgers/pizza/wraps etc.The pool at the hotel is quite small but l never saw it overcrowded and its open until 11pm. The pool bar has a happy hour from 6-8pm and you can order burgers etc too. The staff at the hotel are lovely and friendly. Whoever you spoke too, they were always very helpful. If we go back to Florida, we will stay in this hotel again.
1	Awesome boutique hotel!. We recently hosted our daughter's wedding in NOLA and wanted a more intimate setting for guests. We could not have been happier. The location was a short walk to everything you would want to see and do in the French Quarter and easy access to Canal Street shops. The rooms were large quiet and comfortable. Best of all was the service. Beverly and Cynthia at the front desk bent over backwards for our group and felt like part of the family by the end of our stay. If you want to be in the heart of New Orleans without the craziness of the Quarter, the Bienville House is the perfect boutique hotel for you.Thank you so much for your comments about the luxury service you received at the Bienville House! We aim to provide each guest with the same luxurious experience you described. Please come back and visit us soon!
0	room is old and smell. Excellent location. This hotel room is old and smell. WIFI does not work in room at all. we called the front desk about internet issue. They told us wireless is weak in room (it never works even early next morning) cause too many tenants are using it. () This is an on-going issue and why the hotel does not fix... More
0	A huge disappointment!. On arriving in Hawaii after night flight, We were sent here from the hotel we actually booked.

1	Our Seach Has Ended!. Ever time we travel to D.C., one of our kids' favorite destinations, we struggle to find the right place in the right area. We either find a nice place that is almost a mile from the Metro stop or we find a crappy place within steps of a stop. The Ritz was on-point. From the ambience, to the staff, the quality of food, cleanliness of the rooms, down to the way they treated our children we loved it! The cherry on the ice cream is the Ritz is litterally 100 ft from the Metro. We will never search for a hotel again!
0	Nice Staff, BUT........ While the staff was nice, the keys for the door did not work (old eighties style with many holes. The place smelled like cigerette smoke and was very dirty. The surrounding neighborhood was scary and the parking lot entrance was hard to find.
1	KD. Walking distance to a lot of great restaurants and tourist sites. Has easy in/out parking. It's clean and well managed with courteous staff. No free breakfast and anything offered (oatmeal, fruit) is pricey. Very modern building and the lobby is loud due to being mostly cement. The lobby also has a bar and one night it was quite loud when we came in. The rooms are modern, too, with small bathroom counters and shower area. Beds, towels, desk all comfortable and clean. Thank you for choosing us during your recent visit to Atlanta. We value you and appreciate your business.
1	Really nice hotel close and convenient for the airport. We ended up staying here as a result of a long delayed flight back to the UK. The property is really nice, the rooms were large and we had two adjoining rooms one with a large king sized bed the other with two singles. The rooms are spacious, light and clean and the bathroom was really big in the king room. TV channels were great and I do like the Marriotts inclusion of Netflix on the TV's too. We ordered room service as we were really late, despite being past 11pm we were able to order an item from the pre-11pm menu. The two dishes were both seriously good and way beyond what I'd ordinarily expect for room service. The burger was succulent with a good bun and crispy bacon and I really recommend the Chef's special sandwich the brisket is to die for. Don't go for the chips though as ours were soggy. We arrived for breakfast bang on 10am having been told breakfast finished at 11am - which the ala carte does but the buffet finishes at 10 however the server and staff allowed us to continue with the buffet. All the food was great and the ability to have freshly cooked scrambled eggs is a real plus. We used the pool area, being able to swim inside and out was fun for the kids as was them watching me go from jacuzzi to pool as I invaribly froze! We had lunch by the pool, which was served with a good portion size of hummus and meat platter, the flatbread pizza was good with a very tasty sauce. The standout item for me though was the service. Service is so important and every single staff member we encountered appeared to go out of their way to please us, it was a great pleasure to stay at a hotel where the staff really were very accommodating and helpful and for this reason I would really recommend this hotel to anyone in need of an O'Hare hotel.
0	Not Great. This motel was not that clean. Long, black hair in tub. Breakfast was horrible, no one around stocking syrup and such was empty and nothing seemed stocked at 8 a.m, dirty tables. Couldn't even eat there, we left and went down road to have breakfast. On the positive side, it was quiet and shower had good water pressure.
1	We were treated like royalty by the hotel staff.. Unfortunately, we had an emergency as soon as we walked off the plane. I received a phone call that my brother had passed away. When I got to the hotel and explained it to the front desk supervisor, Empriss, she was very compassionate. She did everything in her power to make our shortened stay as comfortable as possible. All the staff were very friendly and I plan on returning as soon as possible to complete our trip. Our room was awesome. Very clean. The view was awesome. We plan on returning as soon as possible to complete our trip. Thanks Empriss for being so kind and caring.
1	extremely pleased. My husband and I stayed 5 nights and were extremely pleased with all aspects of our stay. I had been a little apprehensive prior to arrival because the price was so good, I feared that the room might not be as nice as we wanted. However, we were thrilled with the appearance, cleanliness, service, and friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. We would definitely choose this hotel again.Thank you for your kind review and I am glad to hear how much you enjoyed your stay. The Hawthorn Suites Dallas Park Central is perfect for long stays and I hope you will visit us again the next time you are in Dallas.
1	Best Hotel in New Orleans. If you are looking for a hotel near the French quarter and want luxury and service - this is the hotel for you. All rooms were clean, a good size and beautiful.The staff were so helpful and we are in the hotel restaurant a couple of times and the food was delicious and very helpful staff.When we come to New Orleans again this hotel is a must for us.SandGT,Thank you for taking time to leave feedback on our hotel! We take pride in giving excellent service for everyone who walks through our hotel, and are happy to hear that you loved your stay with us, as well as the helpfulness of the staff! The Food Beverage team will be thrilled to hear of your love of the food as well! We are lucky to work in a historic property in its prime location, but know that without a consistent level of top notch service our guests would choose one of the many other options nearby. Again, thank you for promoting us on TripAdvisor. We look forward to hosting you during your next stay! Have a wonderful day!
1	Nice visit to NOLA. Recently stayed at the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans. The hotel was an exceptional experience from the old 1910 building to the amazing queen suite. We would make any future visits to New Orleans included a stay at the Whitney Hotel. Front desk staff helpful, friendly and very informational about locations in the city. Parking was somewhat priced out there but the valet service took good care of our truck and promptly brought it to us when we called for it. Would recommend this hotel to anyone that wants to experience New Orleans in actual history and ambience.Thank you for the great review and for your recent visit to the Whitney Hotel! We'll pass along your kind comments to the staff and look forward to seeing you again soon. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral ManagerCasey.CallaisWhitneyHotel.com
1	Nice hotel right next to Space Needle!!. Hotel is situated right next to space needle (major attraction in Seattle downtown). Across the street there is the space needle, the Chihuly gardens, the EMP, and the Seattle center, a lovely park with an amazing playground. Breakfast in hotel was complimentary and was good considering a budget hotel (3 star). The courteous and always willing to serve staff and Chef played a big role. Free 24 hr shuttle within a mile of hotel but sometime wait time is high if you are in downtown markets.Well worth it in Seattle!Devendra G,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor. We are thrilled to hear that you created wonderful memories throughout Seattle and utilized the amenities within our beautiful new hotel. I will pass on your kind words to the staff, they will all be bursting with excitement knowing they made a difference. We are always trying to leave our guests with lasting memorable experiences. Please let us know when you plan on returning to Seattle as we would love to you welcome you as our guest again!Sarah Junge

The room was decent, but they didn't clean it while I was working all day. No clean towels. Did not have bravo. Will not be back or recommend for the price. Do not understand how this hotel is...

0	From 5 stars to 1 star How can this be. Same hotel, same great location, same great bed and incredibly comfortable pillows. So how can the review of my second stay here drop down to one star after previously according this hotel five stars on my other visit Easy, room service, or better stated, lack thereof. We were there for three nights. On our second day, we headed out early and knowing we were going to be gone for at least several hours, we thought it would be an opportune time for them to clean our room and make the bed. Upon our return and to our dismay, the room had not yet been made up. But we figured, no biggie, they can do so once we head out to dinner. And they did indeed do the job. The next day, the same thing. We headed out for a few hours and asked them to once again make up the room while we were out. We even gently reminded housekeeping of what happened the previous day, and they assured us the room would be done by the time we returned. Well, once again, when we returned, nothing had been done. Not being too happy, we spoke with the housekeeping supervisor and explained the situation. She apologized and said they'd get right on it, so we headed out to have some fun (always something to do in this town). But yet again, after we returned, the room still was unmade. We went downstairs and firmly, but nicely complained to the desk clerk about our situation. She said that someone would be sent up promptly, so we headed to a bar and killed about an hour and a half. Upon returning, almost incredibly so, the room was still not made up. By now we were extremely frustrated, so I called down and asked to speak with the on-site manager. I explained everything to him, expressing our frustration and feeling that our requests were blatantly disregarded. He assured me that the room would be cleaned immediately and even deducted 100 off our bill. Well, the room was finally cleaned and yes, our bill was reduced by 100, but the bad taste hasn't left my mouth. This was horrible customer service and be rest assured we will not stay here again.Thank you simiseeu for taking the time to provide your feedback on your recent stay with us. As we pride ourselves on delivering a memorable hotel experience during your travels, we have unfortunately fallen short of our goal during your recent stay. Please accept our sincere apology for the cleanliness issue you had with your guest room as well as in inconvenience you had to endure because of our housekeeping department. We have shared your feedback with the appropriate hotel team to ensure that this was an isolated issue that is corrected moving forward.Upholding our commitment to provide a memorable experience with exceptional service, we hope to have an opportunity to better your experience with us whenever your travels bring you back to New Orleans.
0	Romance in a creepy place. We stayed in a Queen with a private bath. Even this room was way too small. When I opened the door, I could barely get my luggage in without hitting the bed. We picked the romance package which came with a bottle of Edgefield sparkling wine, handmade local chocolates and massage oil. Very nice! We didn't eat here because we both feel McMens has grown tired - and there are so many great new restaurants in McMinn. If you like a tiny room with a creepy atmosphere, this place is for you!
1	Expensive but fancy. When pricing hotels, don't forget about the 50/night parking fee and the resort fee for this hotel. These will add about 75 per night to the listed price. Nice hotel and great location. However, if you don't care about modern furniture and a shot of saki between 5-7pm, then you can find cheaper hotels in the area of the same quality, such as the Mosser, through various travel websites. Thank you for taking the time to share your stay with us. We are pleased to hear you enjoyed our location and hotel. We apologize if you were unaware of the expensive parking rates in SF. Our valet is operated by Pro Park America and though the charge seems high, they are competitive with the surrounding hotels pricing in our area. We value your comments and hope to have the pleasure of seeing you again soon!
0	A sad example of the BW brand. Too many misses from the normally great and reliable BW brand...sad! Hopefully they will be able to fix things and get back on board. We are Platinum level BW members and this is not the quality we have come to expect
1	A delite to the senses!. I spent 2 nights in this Unique property - If you love Art and you love the unusual and sensory pleasures of sight and taste this is the place for you.Upon my arrival I was greeted with enthusiasm and an eagerness to please. Every associate from the Valet, Front Desk, Bartender, Restaurant staff could not have been better. Since I travel often and am in 5 star properties - I was delighted at the wonderful service of this property. Open spacious rooms with a very sexy element - great city views - comfortable beds. Very eclectic - modern - artistic - beautiful.The bar had a variety of custom beverage none of which were your ordinary spirits. Match (the restaurant) offered a fantastic menu with delicious dishes many with a twist.Whoa! This review just blew us away. There are those guests who just get it and you totally nailed our vision in this review. Thank you for the kind words and for sharing your experience. We'll be sure to share with the team! We do hope you'll come back soon.
1	Stylish Hotel in good location, little noisy though. I really liked this hotel and the nice little features in the room. Also, it has a decent gym and the location is also good, maybe 15min walk to Union Square. On the other side, if you are in the wrong room, you can hear your neighbours talking. Even though, the hotel wasn't booked out and they had plenty of rooms available, they put us in the room next to the elevator. During that night, I didn't sleep more than 30 min. After complaining, they gave us a different room which was much better. But why not giving us a quiet room in the first place!Dear Tim E,Thank you very much for your review I am happy to hear that we were able to accommodate you in a quieter room resolving the noise issue. I am also happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay, and we hope you will be returning soon to the Hotel Vertigo.Warm Regards,Jaime GonzalezFront Office ManagerHotel Vertigo

We found hair in the tub, we found bugs in the bed, we had a gap in an old suite door that you could see other room and they could see us. the people whom stayed next to us had two very large and loud barking doors. when we called about the issue we got no reply until we made...

1	Wonderful Hotel. Of course it is very beautiful, and from its look you might think that it would be stuffy, but it is not- Very friendly and welcoming staff, and the Head Butler, Nestor, on the 7th floor could not have been a better representative in making us feel at home! Best Hotel in NYC- have stayed in many , luxury and not,in NYC and all over the world. Actually always wanted to stay at the St. Regis, and this did not disappoint!Dear Diane,We are thrilled to hear how much you enjoyed your stay, and that Nestor made you feel at home. Our Signature Butler service differentiates us from the competition, and we are thrilled that you were able to experience this first hand.We look forward to welcoming you back to New York again soon.Kindest Regards,Senih Geray
1	Good Amenities in Dated Decor. Rooms spacious, including bathroom. Clean and functioning well. Attentive staff. Very dated decor throughout - distracting, but little impact on our experience there. Requested 2 queen as listed on Hotels.com, but hotel offers 2 DOUBLE beds, which is a significant drawback for our family. Free ear plugs because closing doors are LOUD. That might have been the only downside. Pool and hottub were great. Ample supply of towels with extended access hours as compared to some places we've stayed. Breakfast was good, but crowded. Layout is a challenge when busy as several key items are in corners or nooks. No place to line up but through the dining tables, pathway, etc. Would stay here again if the price were right. Otherwise, would be a more modern competitor with queen beds.
0	AWFUL!!!. I usually dont write reviews but in this case feel like i need to Warn others... We booked a non smoking room on line.

1	Highly recommended hotel. Stayed here for 3 nights. A really funky and comfortable hotel. Helpful and able front of house staff with easy check in. Room very comfortable - especially the bed. Nice bathroom and cool decor and furnishings. Loved the Alice's adventures in wonderland book by the bed. Added to the quirkiness of this place. Gym just the right size too. I had an issue with hot water one morning but quickly resolved and appropriate response from the management. This is my second stay in a kimpton hotel in Philadelphia and my first at hotel monaco. I will come again.Peter H -We'll break the bad news to the Hotel Palomar (our sister property) that you'll be back here. Thank you for choosing the Monaco and embracing the (subtle) quirk. Sorry to hear about the hot water hiccup, I assure you that is not typical by any stretch.Safe travels -Mark
1	Great Location!. I gave this hotel 4 stars for staff and location. The staff were pleasant, very helpful and upbeat. It's a great location right in the center of many historical sights! It's walking distance to sights like Penn's Landing, the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall. The hotel is across from the US Mint, next to Ben Franklin's grave and near some good eateries like Sonny's and Happily Ever After. It also offers its own restaurant, bar and fitness center. Free wifi. It was a reasonable rate for the area. Parking was 36.75 for overnight but you can keep your car there the next day until 5pm. However you may be able to find a cheaper garage nearby. As far as the rooms themselves go- those I would rate a little lower. The room was a little on the small side and definitely could have been cleaner (like the bathroom and under the beds) but it was adequate and by no means did I feel like it was so dirty I wouldn't stay the night. Rooms are probably a 3 however. The room did have a coffee maker, microwave and mini refrigerator which was great! They are updating some different features so maybe this was part of it. Dear Trip Advisor Guest,Thank you for your feedback. I'm glad you enjoyed your stay and I would agree that we are in the perfect location to visit many of the historical sites in the area. It's a great part of town. Thank you again and we hope to see you back sometime in the near future. Regards,

1	Can't beat that!. Very professional staff who neither try too hard to build rapport, nor come off as too aloof. They get right down to business and make your comfort their first endeavor. I called ahead of time and made sure my reservation was still confirmed. When i got there, they immediately know who I was and had me checked in right away. The room was clean, without a hair out of place. All the appliances worked perfectly, and the room was definitely spacious enough, with a cushy bed and NON SMOKING (Thank you!). Breakfast was delicious, and they made sure to keep all the good stuff stocked throughout the ENTIRE breakfast. Thank you, Best Western, we shall meet again!Good Morning,Thank you for taking time to review your stay with us.I sincerely appreciate all your wonderful compliments to our property and staff.

0	All they want is your money. I'm not sure why this place gets such good reviews because there are other places in Napa that are so much better, see my other reviews.1. They charge your card before you ever arrive. Not just reserve the money but charge the card. 2. A 72 hour cancellation policy (ridiculous) and they never answer the phones so canceling is impossible anyway. 3. Would not honor Google offers coupon. 4. Blinds do not block the light so your up at 6 whether you like it or not. 5. Noisy street. The only reason this got 2 stars is the room is new and clean but I would never stay here again!
1	Decent hotel. This hotel is conveniently located few mins away from Union square. The staff are friendly and helpful but it doesn't have any dining area. only a lobby and lift to the rooms. At the time of our visit there were redecoration work was being done but it never disturbed us. The room is clean but had a view of brick wall from the windows. Decent water pressure in bathroom. Separate sink for washing hands from the bathroom. The closet with weird cover of metal strings was annoying but OK. overall an OK place but not somewhere I would love to get back to! Oh, and parking was overpriced. We found nearby parking for much cheaper priceDear Guest, Thank you for sharing your experience with us! I am happy to hear you enjoyed both our fantastic location and staff - they really are a winning combination. On your next visit with us, you will have to try Colibri, our wonderful Mexican Bistro connected through our lobby. We do offer the valet, however if in-and-out access is not needed, there are close by options that are more cost efficient (through do not provide that access). I do hope we get to welcome you back on your next adventure to San Francisco!All the best, Tyler Layton
0	Horrible. They dont care about their guests.. This place is awful. The rooms are tiny and cramped. The kitchen where breakfast is served is tiny and doesnt have close to enough seating for guests. The shower drain doesnt work. I asked to check out two days early and they didnt even ask what was wrong let alone try to resolve it. I asked them to refund one of the two nights and they refused to refund a dime. If you book here, know that they wont do a thing to make things right. Hello RadiantVoid, Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to review your stay. I'm concerned that you departed early due to your dissatisfaction yet still paid full price. If you would, please contact me directly so I can look into this further for you. Jenna UbrigJubrigthefreehand.com
0	This place shouldn't be a Days Inn. I've stayed at Days Inn's before in other cities and another location in Orlando, and although they are not the most luxurious hotel's around, they are adequate and easy places to stay - except this one!I just checked out this morning after being there 3 days. The main problem was with checking in. Several weeks before, I booked my stay on-line at their web site, choosing a pool-side room with 2 double-beds for a price I had to pre-pay for in advance. When I checked in, they gave me a room with 2 double-beds, but not pool-side. Instead they gave me a room on the top floor of their tower, which was literally the farthest room away from the front desk. When I said I reserved a pool-side room, I was told they didn't have any. When I showed them my reservation that I printed on my computer printer after I made the reservation on-line, the male clerk working that evening (the manager) said, That's not guaranteed. WHAT When I was making the reservation on-line, you are given about 12-15 different choices of rooms to choose from, depending on type and number of beds, amenities, etc. If a room isn't guaranteed, then why is a guest given all these choices to choose from Also, if the room is pre-paid for in advance, doesn't that lock in a guaranteeThis is just the first of all the domino's that began to fall when I was checking in. With my luggage, I walked up the 5 flight's of stairs to the room they gave me to find out the key wouldn't open the lock (magnetic key card). I walked back down first put my luggage back in the car before going back to the front desk telling them the key wouldn't open the door. They called for a Maintenance person to walk up with me to the room and he tried to open the door with his master key. It wouldn't unlock. He continued to try for about 3 minutes when it finally opened, then said to me There you go. But then I asked him if I go out tonight, I don't want to stand there for 3 minutes trying to open this door, at which he replied that he would be back in the morning to fix it. As he walked away, I entered the room and almost keeled-over from the smell in it. No kidding! It smelled as though someone had deficated human feces everywhere in the room. In addition, the lights were already on, the beds were unkept, and the TV was playing. I quickly ran out and yelled at the Maintenance guy to come back. When he entered the room, he looked surprised and went to the phone to apparently call the front-desk. At this point, I was livid! I stormed out of the room, ran down to the front desk, and in front of everyone in the lobby pointed at the male clerk behind the desk and sternly said, I want the pool-side room I reserved and I want it now! He yelled back We dont have any! I don't care for your attitude with me and I'll call the cops and have you thrown out for trespassing. Then you can sleep on the street tonight! At that, I said, Fine, and picked up my cell phone to call Days Inn's 800 number with the intention of getting someone of authority higher up than this guy to fix this situation. Possibly feeling threatened, the male clerk and a female clerk pulled out a large notebook and began looking frantically through it. When I reached a human voice on the Days Inn 800 line, the male clerk said he had a room on the 2nd floor with a king bed and asked if that would be OK with me. I told the person on the phone I may be calling back then hung up. I told the male clerk that I would look at it and let him know. He made up 2 keys, I went to look at the room, then returned to the front desk to tell him that it would be acceptable. After I settled into the room, I returned to the front desk and told the male clerk I was sorry for my outburst, but that I was within my right for it because of the problems that occured. I didn't catch every word the clerk said after that, but it sounded something like You don't know what's going on around here so there was no need to act like that, which told me there may be some sort of internal, political employee problems at this hotel - but that's still no excuse for the problems I enxcountered as a guest of this hotel.When I checked out this morning, the female clerk who took care of it asked me timidly Are you still mad at us She told me she was working the night I checked in and saw everything that happened. I answered her Yeah - a little bit, and she only said she hoped I would consider returning again sometime in the future. Maybe - if they gutted the place, did a complete remodeling job and hired all new, respondible hotel staff.
1	Excellent Hotel. We stayed at this hotel for 3 days prior to taking a cruise.This hotel is in a great location-within walking distance of the French Quarter and the Riverwalk.Our room was large and very clean. The furniture was up-to date. The beds were comfortable. The free breakfast buffet in the morning was wonderful...everything you need to start the day off right and the free supper buffet in the evening was equally delicious, including 3 alcoholic beverages per person. The rooftop pool and hot tub area with lounging chairs etc. was also very clean. The staff were also very friendly and polite. From check-in to checkout all the employees were great. Any request was responded to immediately. A special thank you to Renaldo for all his help in trying to locate a missing bag for us.This hotel is a gem...we would stay here again if we are ever back in New Orleans and would recommend this hotel to all...you won't be disappointed.
1	Best Downtown Hotel In Seattle. We have stayed in many of the downtown Seattle hotels from the hip to the old school and this is by far the best hotel - great service, airy and well appointed rooms - everything works like it should in this price range. We especially liked the location - you can walk everywhere and the neighborhood around this hotel feels safer than some other downtown areas... the hotel is especially convenient to the light rail network so an easy trio in from the airport and a short walk.Our only minor quibble (and this is minor in the big scheme of things, but an area Hyatt may want to look at) is charging a 1/bottle of drinking water - in a 300+/night hotel the water should be free and plentiful!
0	They've let this place go. It's like this used to be a decent hotel and they just stopped caring. Took the hotel clerk 3 tries to give me the right keys, after sending me to the wrong room. Beds are not very comfortable, and the heating / cooling is really noisy.
0	Ok if you just need to sleep a few hours. The hotel smelled funny, there was no elevator, there was no bar or chain on the door and it was hard to lock. The beds are on metal boxes. Every time you moved you sounded like an old metal desk.
1	St. Patrick's Day and Drury Inn. We took a detour from North Louisiana on our anniversary weekend-forgetting that it was also St. Patrick's Day! We ended up in New Orleans and enjoyed touring many familiar and favorite neighborhoods. We made our way slowing down Magazine Street close to where we onced lived and realized that a St. Patrick's Day parade was wrapping up! Desperate to find accommodations my husband walked into the Drury Inn on Poydras St. and booked the last room of the hotel.The lobby was lively with happy hour and we enjoyed a quick glass of wine before going to our room on the first floor! We were amazed at the quality and comfort considering the low price we were offered! ( Ask for those military and senior discounts.) The staff was courteous and friendly, the room quiet and comfortable! The inn is close to the quarter and cost a mere 6 for a friendly cab ride! We were dropped off right at the start of the parade on Bourbon St and enjoyed a after-parade drink in another hotel on Canal. We were fortunate to meet the Grand Marshall's family and enjoy their story of life in and around New Orleans! Parking is extra but well worth the price and peace of mind knowing your car is being cared for in an off-site location.
0	Great location but poor service. We stayed at the Luana Waikiki for 1 week. When we first came to the room we found terrible rotten smell there. Staff found that some food was left in the sink and we waited for an hour before it was finally cleaned and air...More
0	No Hot Water, No Cable. No cable, no hot water. Reported to staff/manager He said all of Albert Lea didn't have cable, and hot water always works...you just need to pull really hard on the faucet (which I did). No apologies, just stated we already offer the lowest price rate, and I can't do anything about it I thought I would take a chance since I was there for 1 night after reading reviews. My advice DON'T DO IT!! After a long hard day of work, a hot shower and cable is not expecting too much.
0	Disappointing. Very tired hotel. Floors were cement hard, covered with a thin rug - no pad underneath.
0	Smelly room. Room smelled musty, carpets and bedding had a sticky feel. Pool out of order. Keep driving and don't stop here.
0	I should not be charged for this experience!. Noisy hotel, paper thin walls and not conducive to sleep. We stayed here because it was near the hospital and we heard they offered a special rate for hospital patients. We were not offered a discount rate and got no sleep before surgery either! Hippy dog in halls at 2 am, car traffic late night and early morning, dark surroundings with little security are reasons why we will never stay here again. Also, no smoking room reeked of smoke especially when bathroom fan was turned on. Morning receptionist did nothing to resolve.
1	Anniversary Trip. Even though I've worked for a W property in the past, I had never stayed in one as a guest so I was super excited when we had enough points saved up for a 2 night stay at the W Seattle for our 1st anniversary. Upon arrival, Nina (super sweet and friendly) assisted us and let us know that our room was not ready yet so they stored our luggage and said they would email us when it was ready. We never received an email but headed back around 4pm and it was ready. They had defeathered the room per our SPG profile and even upgraded us to a Cool Corner Room. I was so excited! Their W Insider (concierge) had emailed us prior to the trip and asked if we were celebrating anything special. We told them it was our anniversary and he was able to upgrade us as a surprise. Along with the upgrade, was a bottle of champagne on ice and some homemade gummy bears which totally put a smile on our faces. That's hospitality at its finest. The room was super clean and the view was amazing with 4 large windows. The room also had a really nice chaise lounge that couple be separated into 2 seats or combined for 1 lounge. It was really comfy. The W mattress is also really comfy and I liked that the bed was lower to the ground. The AC was also really quiet which provided us 2 nights of really good sleep. In the evenings, they had live music in the Living Room and after 9pm they had a DJ so it was sort of a party atmosphere at night but no noise could be heard from the room aside from city street noise. Overall, we had a great experience. The staff always greeted us when we walked by and the valet guys always opened the doors for us. I hope to visit again soon!PS- it's a 6 block walk to Pike Place Market. No need to rent a car as everything was within walking distance. WOW, thank you for sharing about your recent visit 882triciam, we appreciate the opportunity to be part of such a special event! It sounds like you were able to take advantage of our location to check-out everything Seattle has to offer, including some live local music in the Living Room. The team works hard to make sure our guests every need is met and I'll be sure to share this with them.
1	Great value and even better location. Stayed here for a week (Sat. to Sat.) while visiting San Diego. The hotel was clean and free breakfast was great. The hotel seemed to be newer as evident by the modern decor.For those traveling with small children, our room only had a shower. Our 2 yr. old has only taken baths so he had to quickly get used to a shower, which did not end up being too bad for us. Location is excellent as you are 10 minutes from Sea World, Zoo, Balboa Park, USS Midway and much more. Parking is usually 16 a night but when we checked in they gave it to us for 10 a night! We rented a Hyundai Elantra and anything bigger would have been a pain to park as spaces seem very tight. This was not only at the hotel, but pretty much anywhere we parked in San Diego.
1	A hotel to remember. Comfortable clean pleasant spacious rooms with cooking facilities Friendly and helpful staff Superb breakfast Good location opposite the Space Needle and Monorail Best of the hotels during our three week holiday in America Highly recommendedDear Nick W,Thank you very much for reviewing the Hyatt house Seattle! We very much appreciate the 5 star review and are delighted to hear you felt we were a hotel to remember! We know you have a lot of choices when staying in Seattle and are thankful you choose us and would highly recommend us.Thank you and I hope the rest of your trip in America went just a great! Sincerely,Jonathan
1	My first visit to NYC and the PC. Just a short comment which I feel impelled to make regarding the Park Central where we stayed. We had been looking at cheaper accommodation but am so pleased we stayed at PC as the beds were so big and comfortable. I have never slept so well on holiday. The icing on the cake however was the wonderful assistance we received from Elizabeth of Customer Relations. After a long flight from UK and delays at airports and taxi rides, she was the perfect hostess on arrival in a strange city when we were both tired and worn out. We shall never forget her bright hospitality and she is a great ambassador for the hotel.Best Wishes.Maureen
1	Loved this garden oasis. We stayed at this gem of a hotel for 3 nights pre-cruise. It is a small 2 storey garden oasis surrounded by high-rise towers. The staff were very friendly, the room was quiet and clean and a reasonable size, the bathroom small but perfectly fine.The breakfast was much better than I expected - cereal and pastries, fruit, juice, and always something hot - bacon, sausage, pancakes, scrambled eggs, hash browns. It could be eaten in the small lobby, outside at a table, or taken to your room.It was a good price and within easy walking distance of all that San Diego has to offer, which is much!
1	Great location. If you're looking for a quiet and peaceful stay in a historic neighborhood, this hotel would be wonderful choice. Traveling from the hotel to the French Quarter takes approximately 20-30 minutes (depending on your means of transportation). You can pick up the streetcar near the hotel (though some of the lines are currently undergoing construction and buses are used as replacements). The hotel has free onsite parking (though the parking spaces immediately adjacent to the hotel are somewhat limited) and free breakfast. The rooms are average sized, with two sinks an added bonus. The front desk staff was extremely helpful and efficient. I would definitely stay here again.
0	A definite Not!!!. Only reason I gave it 1 star is cause it's clean. As for everything else it sucks. Beds suck, pillows sucks. You get a kitchenette but you need to bring your own or buy there's for 35 which is a RIP OFF. Will never be...More
0	Disappointing stay. The manager kept changing rates without notice during my stay. Questionable business ethics. Only cereal and coffee for breakfast. Noisy except in rear rooms, which are not used in winter. Poor maid service.
1	Perfection PERIOD! This is a MUST read review.. I travel as a writer and felt compelled to write about this BEST KEPT SECRET. I arrived being very stressed out as I had been traveling for nearly a month. I have not been to this part of San Diego before so I didn't know what to expect........so my uber pulls up to the main door and you feel as though your pulling up to your home......the doorman welcomes you.......when you walk through the front door you feel as though you are walking into your living room.....its warm well decorated and charming......the stress of my day starts to melt off with every step that I take........I check in and make my way to the garden outside and grab a glass of champagne.....the weather is PERFECT.....the grounds are peaceful and quiet..........I make my way to my room...........the door opens and I am in HEAVEN.........the room is spacious..........its spotless with lush white linens......which is my favorite........I am RELIEVED to see that they carry quality bath products.......always a plus! I shower and sit outside for a moment on my balcony that over looks the pool.......I am overly exhausted to I decide to eat on the property.......I am a LOVER of fish tacos!!! The menu looks incredible and the staff is incredibly helpful and made sure that the tacos were prepared exactly how I like them....and my standards are extremely high as I am very picky.......I finish eating and get an incredible Pinot and chat with the manager about the history of the propert........which is fasinating..........I say good night and stroll back to my room..........I crawl into bed and had the best night sleep that I have had in months............I can not wait to come back and next time I plan on staying a bit longer........thank you for the experience............bravo!Dear amavicustomdesigns,Thank you for choosing to stay at Estancia while visiting the San Diego area. It was a real treat to read your review and we are thrilled to know that you had such a relaxing and restorative stay at our resort. Thank you for sharing such a detailed review of your experience. It's a delight to know how much you enjoyed the beauty of our award-winning grounds, as well as our luxurious guest rooms, savory cuisine, and serene ambiance. We truly appreciate the excellent rating you have awarded us and look forward to welcoming you back to Estancia soon for another blissful stay.
1	Night and day above the other. I say that because I cancelled my second night stay from an awful hotel downtown and booked my second night at the Hotel Lincoln. Best decision I made the whole trip. The room was great (spacious, clean, well furnished and very modern) and the staff was even better. My wife had a bad stomach ache in the middle of the night and I called down to the front desk and asked if they had any Pepto-Bismol. They said no and started telling me where the nearest Walgreen's was and then stopped and offered to get some money from me and go get it for me since it was the middle of the night. I was super greatful and tried to give him a tip, he wouldn't take it. And that is just one example of how excellent the staff was. Next trip to Chicago I'm staying here again!
1	Great Stay. When booking in this area we looked at both Sonoma and Napa. Sonoma is generally more expensive so we picked Napa, they are very close. We were glad that we picked Napa, it is a pretty and very manageable town and this hotel was very good. I thought that it might be a bit far out but it is not. Napa is very small and it is only a few minutes to drive to the central area where there are lots of great restaurants and shops. My husband walked it in the mornings. There are much pricier hotels than this one further out from the town centre.The room that we had was freshly reno'd and was large, clean and had a comfortable bed with nice linens. The only thing that we found a bit strange is what they call a balcony... it is an enclosure with a hole cut in it. We had a room looking out over the pool, but you can't see anything sitting on the balcony.The staff were very helpful and gave us great advice and suggestions each morning before we set out. The breakfast is at Denny's so you can get a big breakfast or get a something smaller and take the 5 credit.The pool and hot tub were small but nice at the end of the day. Would recommend this hotel.We are glad you had a Great Stay. Come back and stay with us on your next visit to Napa.
0	Won't clean. Pubic hair laid on tub next to shampoo bottles all week. When staying all week room only gets cleaned twice a week. I have been on the road for 25 yrs never had my room cleaned only twice a week. Cob webs on ceiling. Didn't pay 40 a night either I would have expected this at that price.
0	Dirty, understaffed and dated. SPG Platinum and Hyatt Diamond who normally favors MCO's Hyatt airport properties. Decided to check out the Sheraton Suites Orlando Airport on an overnight transit stay. I regret the decision and will not return.The suite smelled musty, like a wet dog. Furnishings were worn out and the carpet dirty. Bed was made, but the linens were unclean. Human body, pubic hair, eye lashes and thin cat or dog hair littered the fitted sheet. Three requests and 30 minutes later, a new set of clean linens delivered to my room for me to remake the bed with.If you're an SPG member, save yourself the disappointment. The hotel is on it's last leg. A renovation is well overdue and the property simply isn't competitive considering the other options nearby. This Starwood category 2 property is in serious need of a downgrade. If you've booked this hotel for the price of a pizza on Priceline, you'll probably be happy with the value as many of the positive reviews reflect. For most anyone else, steer clear.Dear JuzzinWe are extremely saddened to hear about your disappointing experience. Although the overall satisfaction rate of our SPG members is generally very high, there is certainly no excuse for such a severe oversight as dirty linens, and I can assure you that this has been addressed with the housekeeping team. As you noted, we do receive many positive reviews and this is not the kind of service we usually provide. Please accept my sincere apologies. SincerelyNelson SantosDirector of Rooms
1	Better than expected. Went there for business, it wasn't the first hotel choice I had but it's what I ended up with.Rooms were very nice, fitness center had plenty of equipment, breakfast was excellent (received free vouchers for that, not sure if they always give those out), had a nice Wednesday happy hour (wing, BBQ, and drinks). The staff was friendlier and responsive than most places I've stayed.Walking distance to the Space Needle.There was a lot of construction and traffic in the area at the time I stayed, but it wasn't a major inconvenience.Thank you for your kind words about your recent stay. We are so happy to hear that your time with us exceed your expectations, and that you were able to take advantage of our Best Brews BBQ! We hope business brings you back to Seattle soon and that you are able to stay with us again.
0	Stay somewhere else. This hotel badly needs updating. The first room the faucet didn't work, the room they moved us to you couldn't open the door, the next room had two double beds instead of a king which I had reserved. I was very disappointed in this Comfort Suites! We usually have good luck with Comfort Suites but not this one. Wouldn't stay... More
0	Dirty carpet and noisy. Carpet so dirty that upon entering shower the foot prints would not rinse off the tub. Laundry room directly below room would shake entire room when maids were doing laundry.
0	Not good.. Terrible. Weak wifi. Room wasn't ready until 7pm. Short staffed I guess. TV had a big scratch in it. Iron was broken.
1	Amazing experience. Best Western Plus Inn at the Vines is located perfectly in Napa Valley. Short distance to shops, downtown nightlife, and my favorite winery. They offered breakfast at Denny's which is a short walk from the hotel. The hotel landscape is eye catching, sort of romantic every time you drive into the parking lot. The amenities they offer are very nice, excellent fitness room, wiifi, and pool area.traveler2016now - Wow, thank you for taking the time to write such a glowing review, it sounds like you had a memorable visit to Napa and this makes me smile! We hope to offer you a stellar time next time you are in town.
1	Recent personal trip to New Orleans. A friend recommended the Aloft, after we had chosen another hotel. We made the switch and were pleased with our experience. We travel often to Europe and felt the European character. My wife and I do not need a lot of amenities-but their exercise room and bar were enough. Since the 'Big Easy' has plenty of excellent restaurants and this hotel was within a very few blocks of the heart of the French Quarter, we did not expect a full restaurant. I would mention that next time I would want to be told that my room did not have windows!!Simple, comfortable and all you need. We do have some great views for your next visit, be sure to book the Aloft rooms so we are able to find the best one for you.Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations
1	Grand Hyatt for non-elite did not disappoint. I am not Hyatt elite and I was reluctant to book this location. I opted for a suite and Kendal hooked me up with an amazing view for the week. Electronic blinds are nice, bathroom spacious, shower walk in. Beds are old - Marriott and Westin have better beds without question. Televisions stink (outdated and small). Exercise room is significantly better than average. I could not talk the front desk into experiencing the concierge lounge for less than 50. Not drinking, I could not justify that cost. Housekeeping was excellent, I requested turn down. I did learn to request sheet changed daily - 3 day sheet changes is too much for me. Bell desk was prompt, friendly. They offered to take my bags up at arrival and I accepted - missed a tip when they forgot about me. Location here is ideal, I walked to everything and cabbed easily in the rain.
0	Why would you. I understand the whole middle of nowhere so we set our own prices but holy cow this is ridiculous! 100 for two double beds in a dingy room The only cool part was the restaurant which I was too afraid of the prices to actually give it a shot. If you have money to blow for absolutely the bare minimum... More
0	Don't be fooled. It may look decent outside, but the rooms are not that great. The bathroom and room smells bad. Had to buy an air freshner because it was so bad. The water smells bad too. Queen size bed and one sofa, and there's a wall barrier between bed and sofa (odd). The breakfast bar was not good. There's a pool, it's okay. And the jacuzzi was out of service. Ice machine out of service.It is unfortunate that you and your family encountered many issues that made your stay less then satisfactory. All of your concerns have been addressed with my staff with the exception of our spa. Unfortunately there is never a good time to remodel, however our spa is in the process of being resurfaced. It is not the norm of our hotel to fall short on so many areas. I apologize on behalf of myself and my staff and will make sure our future guests do not experience the same areas of concern as you did.Sincerely,Best Western Management
1	A quirky unusual place to stay. My husband made these reservations and I was a bit nervous after reading some reviews. I was a bit more nervous when I saw their lobby which is far from the usual Marriott lobbies. However, our room was spotlessly clean, overlooked the lovely pool area and was quite nice. It was smaller perhaps but not nearly as small as I expected from some reviews and not small enough to be an issue. The staff was very accommodating and interesting. The location is centrally located and convenient. This is not a cookie cutter hotel. There is absolutely nothing cookie cutter about it. If you're looking for something unusual, this is it. Thank you for your kind review and for you loyalty to Marriott.We do appreciate the fact that you gave us the opportunity to surprise you in a positive manner. And we are delighted to hear that we have been able to meet and go beyond your expectations.As a boutique hotel from the Autograph Collection of Marriott, we are proud to differentiate ourselves by our unique concept and design.We hope to have the pleasure to welcome you again in the future.
1	Lovely Boutique Hotel. Having only stayed at some of the larger hotels in New Orleans, we decided to try a smaller boutique hotel this time. We had booked a fourth floor sundeck room and I'm very happy we did. The weather was lovely all week and we really made good use of the sundeck. We had a table and chairs and there were lots of beautiful plants all over the deck. Upon arrival at 2:00, our room was not ready. We were told they would call us when it was ready, but by 5:00, still no call. We didn't mind the wait as we just strolled around the French Quarter while we waited. We decided to go back and check on the room and it was ready once we got there. The room as a nice size, especially considering how small some of them can be in the FQ. The room was very clean, although in need of some refurbishment. It is an old building though. The carpet was very stained, but it did seem to get vacuumed every day. We did have a problem with not getting enough towels. There were 3 of us and we only received 2 bath towels, so we had to consistently ask for more towels each day. Other than that, no problems with housekeeping. The room was relatively quiet, facing the river side of the building. We did hear the occasional horn of a passing train, which in the middle of the night, was a bit loud. The staff was all very friendly and helpful. The free continental breakfast was okay, but nothing special. The beds were a bit soft for my liking and rather small.Overall, a very nice experience.
1	Beautiful lobby, downtown location, comfortable room, welcomes dogs. Came here with family and dog for 2 nights on New Years Eve. Wine / champagne reception was fun with lots of room to spread out. Room was comfortable. Bathroom tiny. Not much of a view. Our dog loved the room and was very excited to be here. Love the Kimpton hotels. Starbucks next door, but not too much else around for dining. Hello Dragonfly1004,We are so happy you, your family, and pup enjoyed your time with us, especially at our social hour! Unfortunately being downtown in the city, some of the buildings block the views. Hopefully you visit us again soon. Also, our concierge team would love to recommend dining options in the area for your next trip!Rachel RodriguezGuest Experience Manager
0	Horrible service. First the shuttle was over an hour late after being told by the front desk it was 5 minutes out, then we checked in and were told a crib was on its way up. After two hours and no crib, we were told none was available. The front desk offered very little help, as I found my family a different hotel that had a crib.Joel, Thank you for sharing your concerns regarding your stay with us. I am sorry to hear that my associates were not attentive to your needs and were not responsive to your complaints. I can assure you that this will be addressed with the proper team members so that this is not repeated again. Thank you again for sharing your observations, and we hope to welcome you back again in the future.Sincerely,Michael GoldwasserGeneral Manager
0	What a crappy place. Dirty, smelly, gross.. Had to stay here because nothing else was available. What a pigsty. Absolutely horrendous. There was a prostitute next door...the toilet and shower had to be shared...NEVER told us this. Would not give our money back. The prostitute smoked marijuana and it filtered into our room...there were roaches in the hallway...it was just bad. The area was ok....so we only came in to pass out...avoid.
0	Hotel Needs A Little Help. We've been coming to the Aria Hotel since its grand opening. It's a lovely hotel, but like every hotel in Las Vegas it's highly used. Bedspreads on this visit had questionable stains on them, not freshly replace for our visit. Black mold in the shower area, gross! One of the three pools has changed, they charge 100.00 for lounge chairs... More
1	Perfect!. Stayed for a long weekend. This place is great. It is steps from the cable car turn around, great shopping, and excellent restaurants!! We had a little suite with a separate sitting room and a pull out couch. We faced inside and it was quiet!! Hotel staff was all so nice and always asking if you needed anything. Quick with extra towels, etc. can't say enough to about this location!!! Full size shampoo/conditioner/shower gel in shower. Great restaurant attached to the hotel. We also revived a little bag upon Checkin with two bottle of voss water, some snacks and a bottle of wine. Everything we needed to get settled! Valet was available for 60 a day (comparable to others in the area) we parked the car and used public transportation the entire weekend. I would have no problems recommended! I'd stay here again in a heartbeat!
1	Great Hotel! Stay here!. Loved The Vertigo! Rooms were unique. Hotel was very clean. It's not a 5* hotel but staff was so very helpful. Free wi-fi in the room. Very nice location! Walked to chinatown and Union Square. The only complaint: We were offered a breakfast with our rate and the yogurt was warm. They just had a boxed breakfast sitting in the back room where It should be in the fridge. It's better to go 2 doors down to the breakfast place. It's inexpensive and the food was good. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. The men that worked the front desk were the best. They could answer anything and were very helpful. Can't wait to go back someday!
0	San Francisco hotel. For what we got it was pretty expensive, although it seems all hotels in the area were pretty expensive. The room was very cramped with very little space besides the bed. The room also smelled weird and the staff were not helpful with respect to that. They gave a welcome bag with a bottle of cheap sangria, a small bag of chips, and some water bottles. The lobby has a couple of computers and some tea/coffee.Location of the hotel is pretty good - right near a big mall, the cable cars, subways/buses, and not too far from various attractions. Nice area to walk around in too.Dear slimmybim,Thank you for your time and honest feedback about your stay with us at Hotel AbRi. I am genuinely sorry to read about your disappointment with our guests rooms, specifically regarding the size, smell, and the welcome amenities provided as it seemed that our accommodations were not comfortable for your needs and no value added was provided to you during your stay also I am truly sadden to hear that our gift bag and selections were not well received, our sincere apologies, as we provide about 60 gift bags per day and we update our amenities every month with different themes and varietals, we wish you had informed us of your disappointment with the choice of sangria, so we could have addressed on site, as we have a great partnership with Local Small Vineyards and the relationship is very strong to provide our guests with the best possible experience.We are a currently following up with our housekeeping department on the strange smell, so we can ensure this situation will not surface in the near future. While the building structure is a historical building from 1907, and still maintains many of the architecturally historic qualities from the early 20th century including the interior corridors and original room layout, we are very proud of the overall quality, furniture and modern condition of our property. However this is not an excuse to justify your experience during your stay, we tried to provide you with all the amenities our property has to offer, but as we can see we fail on the delivery. I would like the opportunity to further discuss the details and concerns. Please feel free to contact me directly at 415-392-8800. Thank you again for your time and I look forward to speaking with you. EJ Varela - Hotel Manager
0	Pullout couch nightmare.. Our room was booked because it could accommodate our 3 children. When we pulled out the couch bed we found still soiled sheets from a previous guest. Including blood stains. The front desk person was visibly grossed out after I showed her pictures. The manager...More
0	Don't stay here. Do yourself a favor and do not stay here. Airplanes loud and fly in and out ALL night. Sounds like they take off from parking lot. Shower had no hot water, sheets itchy, towels rough, coffee in room horrible, hair dryer barely works, one small lamp in bedroom, breakfast fruit bowls had 3 pieces of fruit including 2 apples with...

1	Long weekend. We loved the hotel. We had a large partial ocean view. Our room set back 20 feet from the strand. The whole ocean views are right on the strand which might be a little too close. They offer toys and chairs to take to the beach. Also underground locked parking. In ocean beach it is almost impossible to locate on street parking. The staff are wonderful. The hot tub and pool are just the right temperatures. We also loved the balcony. You can really hear the ocean from there as well as just sitting on your very private balcony. You really don't need to rent a car. Everything is within walking distance. We will definitely stay there again. Thank you for taking the time to share your experience and what the hotel have to offer to the TripAdvisor community. As I'm sure many will find this information very helpful. We are delighted to hear that you will be staying with us again, hopefully sometime soon!
1	Perfect from Check In to Check Out. I am not always the big hotel person, they can seem bland to me. But the Hyatt was spectacular: We entered and we were greeted by Michael at the front desk on check in, who when he learned that it was our anniversary sent up some champagne and chocolates, the view from our room, the fabulous workout room (basically a nice gym with sauna and whirlpool), a beautiful bathroom and just a feeling of ease the whole time contributed to our relaxing visit. The workout space was heaven (and I usually hate working out but I enjoyed it here). You can also use the spa and workout space at the hyatt across the street which is even more extensive.We got free wifi too which is something you don't always get with business hotels. It is near the convention center which in some towns can be in a funky area of town. We were just a few blocks from Pike's Place Market, A good retail shopping district seemed to surround us and it was easy to get around.I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a more upscale stay.
0	Go somewhere else!. We had spent 6 weeks travelling around America. This hotel was by far the worst and did not live up to the reviews. (So much so, that we suspected the owner's relatives had posted the positive reviews). The location wasn't as close to fisherman's wharf as was stated. True, it was in Lombard street but it was a 20 min walk to the wharf, and walking back uphill Forget it! It is only for the extremely fit.We bussed it there and back and that was ok but for my mind a little inconvenient. We had a room on the top floor, unfortunately their 2 person elevator stopped at the floor below so we had to lug 5 bags up and down flights of stairs- no fun. The room itself was horrendous. Decor was the fifties with chipped pieces out of the furniture, no room to store our luggage (except for an open alcove that wouldn't take our cases, a filthy bathroom that still had previous tenant's soaps and mess on top of the shower rail. Bathroom sinks were filthy. We were also attracted by the free contintental breakfast. What breakfast The lobby office was 10 feet by 10 feet with a small table with coffee and packets of danishes. You couldn't eat in there and in fact had to stand in line (Half outside the door) to grab a quick danish. Our overall impression Yuk! Spend the bucks and go closer to the wharf.
1	Stellar service experience.. I'm so impressed. I got in late last night, and needed a cab early in the morning, and needed on time. The person I spoke with at the desk confirmed they'd have it there when needed (and I'm sure she meant to, she was very helpful). Well, staff changed overnight and the message didn't get passed on, and even if it had, apparently they're not supposed to do that, I should have called in the morning. When the car wasn't there, I was frustrated. The person I spoke with was very apologetic and tried to help, but when I realized what happened I just immediately booked an uber, and left very disappointed. Things like this are mistakes, no hotel (or person for that matter) is above an occasional mistake, but how it's handled makes all the difference. Tonight I got a personal email from their operations manager apologizing again, which was totally unexpected, and very appreciated. As if that wasn't enough, he also credited me a bunch of Marriott Rewards points in an effort to go the extra mile. Wow. I was amazed! I've had bigger things than this happen, and have just been told basically tough luck. They didn't have to do anything and they did. You could see a small hotel really caring about my experience, but generally I wouldn't expect it from a large chain (or the LARGEST in the world for that matter). My trust is higher now than it was before I checked in. Thank you. Definitely Redeemed. Other than that, normal courtyard, great.
1	Authentic friendly fun stay at this BB. We stayed at the Inn for 3 nights and it truly was the best part of the trip! Kim was friendly, engaging and very knowledgeable about places to go and things to see in NO. The Inn was gorgeous - you felt like you were stepping back into the elite NOLA south. Kim provided outstanding breakfasts and made us feel right at home as she sat down and joined us in friendly conversation. Would return just for the Inn alone (as long as Kim is still there)!You are so kind. It is a pleasure!!!
0	Very bad experience. No clock. No tissues. No coffee pot. No hairdryer. Thin scratchy towels. No shampoo. No microwave (although it was advertised as having one). Refrigerator on warmest setting froze all my food solid the first night. Manager responded, the last order of refrigerators we got are all bad and that was that. I unplugged the fridge and threw away a lot... More
1	Lovely romantic getaway. I have consulted TripAdvisor many times but this is the first time I have written a review. That tells you how amazing this place is. I have been to La Jolla many times and it was such a delight to discover this gem. In fact, I had booked at the Grand Mar, but had checked both properties out when I arrived in San Diego and decided to cancel reservations at the much pricier Grand Mar to stay here. In addition to the charm and intimate setting, the valet, Chris, sealed the deal. He was the epitome of the California surfer dude - blond, easygoing and down-to-earth yet professional and efficient. He kindly offered to park my car temporarily while I checked out the property and was so friendly and welcoming whereas the valet at the Grand Del Mar just motioned me to the guest parking which was at considerable distance.Loved the room, property, dining and the pool/hot tub. It was hard to leave the resort which is quite the endorsement as I LOVE La Jolla village. The only slight snag is that the lovely outdoor restaurant there, Mustangs, was suddenly closed when a pre-booked conference had to move indoors due to bad weather. It was frustrating because we decided to have another romantic meal there on our last evening only to discover when we arrived that it was not open to hotel guests. The other restaurant, Adobe, was open. And while that is equally good and has a lovely indoor ambiance, we really wanted the charm of the outdoor fireplace at Mustangs. The front desk did what they could to see if they would serve us and when they found out that they still couldn't accommodate us booked a last minute reservation for us at my all-time favorite restaurant in La Jolla, George's at the Cove. The only glitch with that was the front desk informed us that the outdoor terrace (which was our preference) was closed but when we arrived we learned it was open. So it all worked out in the end.Again, that was a small disappointment in an otherwise impeccable stay at Estancia. I can't recommend it highly enough. It's quite simply the loveliest place to stay in the San Diego area and incredible value for this type of property. More than that, it is now one of my favorite all-time hotels (and I've stayed at several beautiful Four Seasons and Ritz-Carlton resorts).
1	Great Hotel - Not Too Far from Downtown. Stayed at this hotel from September 27 - 29 and were more than pleasantly surprised by all that it offers. We booked a one bedroom suite which is unusual for a Hampton property, but really enjoyed the spacious room and all that it offers. Room had separate living and bedroom areas, a wet bar in the living room, and two bathrooms. The condition of the room was great, with everything very clean and well maintained. The hotel also has underground parking with elevator access to each floor, a really nice convenience. The complimentary breakfast was very good both days and was well stocked despite being quite busy. We were somewhat concerned about being 15 miles from downtown as we were in San Diego for a concert, but were pleased that the location is actually very accessible and is only 20 minutes from Petco Park and the harbour area. Would certainly stay at this hotel again and recommend this to others.
0	AVOID. Booked as luck of the draw 2 star on Hotwire for 55. Not even worth that. The front desk lady was nice enough. After waiting on an indecisive customer ahead of me, was tired from driving and ready to lay down. Well my key would work. Dragged my bags back down the narrow stairs to the office. Clerk came back... More
0	No parking for trucks with trailers. This Comfort Inn is conveniently located just off an exit of I-40. It had a friendly staff and was clean. Parking is horrible. I was driving a Penske moving truck and towing a car. First of all, despite being visible from I-40, there is a tiny sign on an unlit road directing you to the entrance. It is easy to... More
0	Birthday celebrations gone bad!!!!!!. The Aloft New Orleans Downtown take from you, they do not honor reservations and confirmations.My reservation was made Jan. 3 fr Feb 10-12 for 3 friends birthdays. On arrival I again confirmed that my reservation and rate would be honored and was told YES at front desk by Jamal that checked us in. At check out, I was over charged OVER 300 and told that there was a glitch in their system which was never relayed to me till Monday after 2 emails and a voice mail.THEY ARE THIEVES DO NOT STAY THERE!!!!!!!!!!!We appreciate you reaching out again. As we discussed, it is our policy to honor contracted group rates as we did in your situation. Thanks for staying with us.
0	Awful!. We were price gouged on a Saturday night paying over 300 for a one night stay here which wouldn't have been so bad if the room was decent. The hotel staff were terribly unfriendly. We were made to feel as if we were inconveniencing them so we didn't even bother to complain. Our room had it's bathroom window TAPED onto the window frame. Cold air leaked in all night. I would never recommend this place to anyone.
1	Cheerful and good value.. A chain Hotel but never the less good value for money with large rooms, quiet ambience, a good pool, restaurant and polite staff. Close to the freeways in San Diego's Hotel circle, the Hotel is easily accessible, it's close to the Fashion Valley shopping Mall, it's on the Downtown Trolley route and although it gets busy, it's never overcrowded. A good value for money Hotel away from the busy beach areas. The Restaurant is good value too.Dear Leonard P.:Thank you for choosing the Best Western Seven Seas in San Diego for your hotel accommodations! We appreciate your nice comments in regard to our large guestrooms, quiet ambiance, good pool, our onsite restaurant-Seven Seas Caf, and polite staff. Our property, as you know, is conveniently located and easily accessible. We are also glad that you appreciated and enjoyed the good value of both our guestrooms and restaurant. Guest satisfaction and meeting with their expectations are important to us, so we are happy we met with yours.Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff
1	Great Hotel in san francisco, better than enticipated.. Stayed a weekend. Good facilities and friendly staff. I dont agree with the worn down hotel statements. I thought the rooms were great and clean, looked newish.Location is also good, not in the middle of touristy FW, but in walking distance 20min.Dear TomERob,I shared your comments with our entire staff and it makes me happy that we are able to provide exceptional service. Thank you so much for your 4-star review as it validates the pride we take in creating a memorable experience at the Hotel Vertigo for every guest.Best regards,Luis MoralesHotel Manager
1	Beautiful Hotel. This is the 3rd time staying at the hotel, so obviously we like it. The location is not too far from L.A. for a quick getaway. I think the price can be a bit high, we only stay if we get a good deal and so try to book early and with a AAA discount.The grounds are beautiful, it feels like a Hacienda. The pool is fairly large as is the jacuzzi. There's nice lounge chairs and it never seems too crowded. A good mix of young, old, families, business people having conferences, etc...No one will feel out of place. It is on the quite/reserved side though so I'm not sure how much kids would like it. We usually stay here with our teenagers when we're doing something in San Diego or La Jolla (water skiing, snorkeling, etc...) otherwise I think they would be a bit bored too.Food is fairly expensive, we usually try to do the Mustang's happy hour and then eat out other meals. I don't think I would recommend the food if we paid the full price vs. happy hour prices. The lengua tacos were fabulous as were the chicken wings. Moscow Mule was delicious, but it was strange they ran out of copper mugs. The bar/restaurant was very empty but they had to take our mugs from us at the table and refill for the second round. Service was friendly and fast.Rooms are comfortable, this time we stayed in basic room and didn't have a balcony which I missed. It's pretty to sit out and view their landscaping/fountains, etc..It feels very secluded. They provide you with a bottle of wine in the room which is a nice touch.Gym isn't large but has what you need- about 7 or 8 cardio machines, a few weight machines and free weights. It got a little full, but we were able to do our full routines both days with no issues.There were just a couple of negatives: self parking is so expensive at 25.00 a day. I really wish hotels would just add that in to the nightly room fee along with the resort fees. Each night ends up being 50 more when you add in extras like being able to park your car. Also they offered free coffee/tea service in the mornings but from like 5-6:30 a.m. in the morning which is insane. Who wakes up at 5 in the morning on vacation Either offer the coffee/tea at a normal time which is a minimal cost to the hotel and garners good will to guests or take it away.Dear bakeshop,Thank you for being a frequent and loyal guest at Estancia we're thrilled to be your hotel of choice when visiting the San Diego area. It's wonderful to hear how much you enjoy the peacefulness and beauty of our award-winning grounds, along with the comfortable luxury of our guest rooms, and the friendly hospitality of our staff. We appreciate you, once again, taking the time to share such a detailed review of your experience at our resort and we are looking forward to welcoming you back to Estancia again soon.
0	What it could be... But isn't. We were planning a trip to Atlantic City for a long weekend and hotel prices were high. The Annex at the Chelsea looked like a good, affordable option. Forget the good.The hotel is located a couple of blocks away from the beach, next to The Chelsea which is the main hotel. However, do not think that they have made equal effort to keep both hotels in good condition... The Annex seems like a old, forgotten building which has not seen a painter, a handyman or a cleaning person in a long time.Our room was old, had stains and smelled like an old, humid room which has not seen ventilation in years. The beds were not confortable, the carpets were dirty and there was a ton of noise. It was just bad.It is just a pity because the hotel has a vintage, mad men decor and feeling that, if well maintained, could have made it a very interesting option. But as it is seems to be the case with Atlantic City, they are letting it die.
0	Ruined our Weekend. We had reservation for a month. Day we check in, they tell us they forgot to charge us the holiday rate. They said it was a mistake on their part that the girl was in a hurry to leave the night we made the reservations. We had an email confirmation showing the amount, it still didn't matter. Suddenly instead of... More
0	Cheap and clean but old and worn.. Building and furniture old and worn. Looks scary from the street. Nothing matches. New mattress on bed and room was clean, even the a.c. filters (i always check). Ok if you are a guy just looking to sleep somewhere cheap.
1	Great Hotel For Vacationing. This is an older Embassy Suites that has been very well maintined and updated. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We were there for 6 days and they did everything to make sure our stay was pleasurable. The restaurant is a great place to eat if you are too tired to venture out for dinner. The front desk has a great local restaurant list and the hotel van will drop you off and pick you up when you are finished eating. We loved the daily breakfast buffet and the evening manager's reception. The hotel is located about a block from the metro station. We enjoyed the daily walk to the station and found it very easy to get to all the sites we were they to see via the metro.
0	Dumpy old Sheraton. The rooms are terribly dated and run-down. The A/C in my room had a death rattle that kept me up all night. Gets two stars instead of one for friendly staff and convenient airport shuttle. But that wouldn't be enough to lure me back to this sad property.Dear MikeDAnnArbor, Im happy you were able to take advantage of our 24 hour complimentary airport shuttle and I appreciate your comments about our friendly staff. Im sorry to hear that there was a problem with the air conditioning unit in your room. Although we are diligent with our preventative maintenance program, mechanical challenges can sometimes occur unexpectedly. Once our staff is notified, however, we are usually able to correct the issue quickly and efficiently. I do apologize that you found your room to be dated. The hotel will be undergoing a renovation in 2013 and I hope that you will give us another opportunity in the future. If I can answer any specific questions please contact me directly at 407-240-5555.Sincerely,Lori Rupp
1	Solid mid-tier option. I stayed here 1 night for an overnight layover in Seattle. The hard product isn't particularly special, but my entry-level room was decent, with a comfortable bed, good lighting, conveniently located power outlets, and modern yet unoffensive decor. The view wasn't bad either, with the Space Needle visible in the distance as well as a comfortable couch by the window. In contrast, the bathroom was mediocre, with a shower/tub combo, relatively weak water pressure, and sterile design compared to the rest of the room/hotel. I did have to call to request slippers as I couldn't find any in the room, but they were delivered swiftly.In the past I have steered clear of W hotels due to the impression that they are more style than substance, but the service here was actually very good. I was warmly greeted upon check-in by the friendly clerk, and the concierge desk was also more than happy to recommend some nearby places for a quick dinner (I ended up going with Heartwood Provisions, which was excellent).Hello Oliver L, thank you for your review on your recent stay at W Seattle! We are thrilled that although it wasn't expected, you loved our service! Our team works hard to make sure our guests are well taken care of, and it sounds like you were. Also, thank you for your other comments as we are always looking for new ways to improve our guest experiences, so it is very valuable. Thanks again!
1	Perfect stay in San Francisco. I am regular visitor to SF and this was my first stay in Hotel Abri, I used to stay in the nearby Marriott. Overall, I am highly satisfied with my stay, would recommend it and will certainly come back again. The hotel is very well positioned in the city, close to the large shopping center and quick access to major city landmarks. The rooms are decent size particularly when you consider you are in the downtown core of San Francisco. I had a king size suite, very comfortable, clean, and a well appointed interior. The suite was located internally, away from the busy street which made it very quiet. The hotel staff was very professional, attentive to my requests, and I would like to to thank Christian, Nabih, front desk personnel and everyone else for making my stay at Hotel Abri very enjoyable experience.
1	Quiet, Clean and Hospitable. I routinely stay here when on business in SF. The rooms are clean, the staff are friendly, and it is relatively quiet, especially if you get a room away from the street. The mattresses are excellent for a good night's sleep.Thank you kindly for sharing your experiences with the Orchard Garden Hotel. We are thrilled to hear we are your preferred hotel in San Francisco. I know the comfort that comes from having a home away from home and I am pleased to read you have found that here. All of us look forward to upcoming visits.RegardsQuinn McEnteeFront Office Manager
0	Dirty rooms, rude staff, security nonexistent. Room was dirty to the point of trash under beds and dirty socks behind dresser. Mold in bathroom and kitchen area. At one point came back from visiting family to discover the door to the room open when I know it was locked when I left. Needless to say will not stay here ever again..
1	Highly Recommended!. Very convenient location. Hotel very convenient for traveling in New York City. Recently renovated, very comfortable and clean beds, modern furnishings (LCD TVs), granite counter tops in bathrooms. Good price too! Taking the bus from New York City to the hotel takes only 15 minutes. The commute in can be a little longer, up to an hour, so leave lots of extra time traveling into NYC. The Wal-Mart next to the hotel was very convenient for last minute things. Would return next time I go to NYC. The hotel restaurant never seemed to be busy though, even at night.
0	Nice hotel. NO!. Ask for disabled room on bottom floor. Booked through expedia,never again. Put on 2nd floor, only 1 of the elevators went to 2nd.told by staff to send other elevator to top floor so we could get the correct one to open. Ice machine not on our floor. Rooms were old and smelled musty.
1	Wonderful, quaint B B in the city!. My husband and I stayed several weeks ago and couldn't have been more pleased. We arrived late due to our flights and were greeted with a smile. Our room was lovely and we had a nice balcony to enjoy. Breakfast was terriffic with a wide variety of options. They have a nice rooftop balcony to enjoy the sights and sounds of the city. The staff is wonderful. You might hear another guest but there is polite signage asking folks to observe a quiet hour so as not to disturb other guests. I would easily stay here again on a return visit.
0	Horrible! If traveling here for the Dover races, save your and go somewhere else!. I stayed here 2 weekends ago, as I was traveling to the Dover Nascar races. The hotel cost 500 per night due to the races! When we arrived in the room, it was regular motel style...the tv had cigarrette burns in it...the room reaked of smoke (and I say this even though I am a smoker)...and the bathroom looked like...

1	A+ in All Aspects of the Perfect San Fran B B. This was our first stay and we know that when ever we visit the City, we will ONLY be staying with Marty and his staff. Warm, charming, stunning, Victorian, clean, private garden, spacious and over all THE BEST! We will continue to share your B B with others and let them know it will be their favorite as well, after just one visit. With Warm Regards and Gratitude.

0	Bastante decepcionante. Somos fanaticos de esta cadena Mandarin Oriental, por la excelencia y calidad que representa a nivel mundial, pero debo decir que fue bastante decepcionante, muy mala atencion, personal sin ganas de ayudarte en nada, no me gusto la ubicacion, caro, habitacion pequea para el valor que tenia, ni siquiera la comida era de calidad.. La verdad una decepcion, no deberia llevar el nombre de Mandarin Oriental.. No volveriamos nunca mas.
0	Don't ever stay here!. They try to get moeny out of you any way they can. They charged my friend and I extra for an extra guest even though we booked through Travelocity which says room rate is for two people. The hotel is in a horrible location in a very bad neighborhood, but is close to the Space Needle and monorail which was nice. Customer service is horrible, the pool was completely dirty (not that we were planning on using it), and the entire hotel smelled like cigarettes.
0	A night disturbed by smoking guest(s)!. We were smelling cigarette smoke in our room and proceeded to open both windows and the door. It really didn't help so we went into the hall and determined it must be coming from the room across from us and into the vents. We called the desk, they sent a man up, and he said he could not knock on... More

I don't understand how this hotel is getting such good reviews.Let me just say, we couldn't wait to get out of here and preferred to wait hours in the airport to staying in the hotel.I did feel sorry for the check in girl. She was alone and it was very busy, but she was very polite and nice.

1	Excellent hotel!. Excellent hotel with very friendly employees. Great location within easy walking distance of the convention center and in the midst of many excellent restaurants. The business center consisted of a computer and printer in a hallway but it all worked first rate. Very nicely appointed room. The wine and cheese at happy hour was an very nice feature. Excellent experience!Dear David N,Thank you, we never tire of hearing that about our hotel and team! We're thrilled you had a good time in our home and I hope you make it back soon.

0	Horrible Experience. I rented a non-smoking room for 4 days. Soon as I opened the door, it smelled like smoke. The door handle for the bathroom kept falling apart. Management never fixed. Everytime I exchanged towels for clean ones, there was an issue with them. I had to wait 16 hours, for 2 towels! Very disappointed.

The management of the property are nice enough people but they fall victim to some of the clientele that somehow cannot help themselves but to have police called on them.

1	Ramada Limited San Diego. The people were nice. Service was great! Would like a little more variety for breakfast but it was good. I liked that the room was very clean and had wooden floors. The outside doesn't look that great but the stay was good and it was comfortable.Thank you for choosing Ramada Limited San Diego/Near SeaWorld. We are so happy to hear that our service was a hit! It is our belief that every guest deserves the very best of our awesome city. When you are searching for another great value here in the area, look no further than us!

Our ocean view room was wonderful and we are looking forward to staying again once the renovation is completed!The rooms were clean, but need some upgrading--But we were only in the room to sleep so it really didn't bother us...The mini fridge came in handy as well as the ABC Market a few steps away. Subway, Coldstone, Wolfgang Puck's are two minutes away walking...Sushi place within 5 minutes walking!!! McDonald's Burger King within 3 minutes walking...Check out the Pacific Hotel for some awesome cuisine and a huge aquarium!Thanks for making our 4th of July fun....Hey, everyone, don't forget to pick up the Entertainment Book for Hawaii...We saved a lot on Parasailing, Hiking, Snorkeling, Restaurants, Pearl Harbor, etc...Great two for one offers! I got mine on Ebay!
1	Something very special about St. Regis. In New York it is uncommon to return to any large chain hotel and be greeted by the same person at the reception desk and even rarer for that person to actually remember you. Easy when they see your name you say but when they ask a personal question that indicates they really do remember you, it is special. My other posts on t.a. are redundantly complimentary about the St. Regis hotels. The lovely receptionist here in NYC, Je, is one of those special people. We try to visit NYC as often as possible being only 2 hours away in Connecticut and there is no finer place to stay than the St. Regis. I would highly recommend that if you enjoy traveling in style and want to be treated exceptionally well, get a Starwood American Express card and indulge yourself in its many generous gifts. Starwood is to be commended for attracting and keeping outstanding personel such as Je at the NYC St. Regis .Dear WHVIP,On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at our hotel. We are thrilled to hear how much you enjoy staying here, and we deeply appreciate your loyalty. We will share your kind words with Jie, and look forward to seeing you again soon.Warmest Regards, Daniela CataldoDirector of Rooms

1	Great property!. This a super nice Hampton. The desk staff is friendly, the breakfast was delicious. Our room was spotless. The beds are super comfortable. We had a river view room with a balcony. It was nice to be able to relax on the balcony.We had an issue with the thermostat and maintenance came up promptly--turns out it was operator error! Asked for extra towels one evening and they were brought up immediately. On Tuesdays and Saturdays there is a nice Farmer's Market just a few yards away (I believe it closes in October until next season). A grocery store within walking distance. We definitely recommend!Dear PeggyS513,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We appreciate your valuable feedback, as well all the great things you mentioned about our friendly staff and comfortable beds. Our balcony rooms do have a different thermostat unit than the others and typically we do get calls about them not operating. Unfortunately you do need to be within so many feet of the unit for it to operate properly and this typically take care of the issue. The farmer's market is definitely coming to an end, I would anticipate it to end come November. We're glad to hear that you recommend us and we hope to see you on your next trip to Napa Valley. Thank you, Serina Najar.

The Hilton Garden Inn at the Orlando Airport did not disappoint their staff is friendly, courteous and their property is immaculate.Dear guest Anthony T:Your effort and time in sharing your comments surrounding your experiences during your last stay is most appreciated and something we take very seriously.

She finally offered to let us switch rooms after looking at the room herself.... More
0	BE CAREFUL DO NOT STAY HERE. Where to begin!!! What a filthy rat trap hotel.Literally.In my bathroom window there was edible RAT poison in the open,not to mention the 1 inch Gap under the front door.Upon arrival the parking lot looked like a dump yard.Toilets,mattress',TV's,bottles,condom wrappers were everywhere.The room smelled terrible,I've seen thicker paper towels the the rags in the bathroom.I was afraid to put my bag on the carpet. Fortunately there was a table to leave my bag on. The clincher was on our way out to dinner a maroon cadilac pulls up a 4 of the most disgusting prostitutes get out ready to ply there trade.I stood there in amazement while the pimp told them exactly what was expected of them that nigh,. Again,Please DO NOT STAY HERE

1	Very clean and nice, wonderful staff. Stayed here two nights for a wedding. Very nice, clean, friendly staff, great location, wonderful hotel food -- we were very impressed and would definitely recommend it!! It's also attached to the mall, there's lots to do! Great location, easy to find, great amenities. We requested a crib for our toddler, not only did they provide it (and the rooms are spacious enough to accommodate it), but they also provided her with her own baby toiletries in a cute bag that came with a rubber ducky, she loved it! We will definitely stay again!Thank you for staying with us for the recent wedding you attended. Thanks also for your sharing your nice comments regarding the staff, guest room and hotel food. So happy your little one enjoyed the rubber ducky! We look forward to your return.
0	Pathetic n Lies. Yeah so as named it wz really a pathetic experience to stay in this hotel. It was so dirty n the disk staff r v rude. Especially the ticket selling lady. So shouts n yell at da ppl working there. When v booked da rooms the didn't said anything about extra charges if u book it on trip advisor b5 the charged us extra 2.5 for Dat. The laundry is out of service n da lift is so scary. It makes noises. Not at all recommended to any 1 visiting orlando.
1	Fantastic. I just spent 3 nights at the Estancia while at a conference at UCSD. I can't comment on the location because it was perfect for me for the conference (but I have no idea if you are vacationing). I have to say that the Estancia was just amazing. The service was great the room was spacious and well equipped the mattress was really really comfortable the grounds were beautiful. I have nothing bad to say, and I really loved this hotel!It was a pleasure to welcome you as our guest for the UCSD conference. Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. We are pleased you found our service, room, grounds and mattress to your liking! And yes, the mattresses are quite blissful! Please come back and visit us soon- perhaps for a vacation! We are indeed centrally located to many beautiful destinations and popular attractions for our vacationing travelers. Have a great rest of the weekend! Thank you again for your review.
0	Terrible experience. What a terrible experience. I reserved and prepaid through Hotels.com. I arrived close to midnight because of flight delays and was informed that the hotel was overbooked and that they had moved me to a hotel in Alexandria - 20 minutes away. I received no phone call, email or contact either from the Hotel or Hotels.com. The hotel they moved me too was in no way an equivalent hotel (half the price and they wouldn't refund me the difference which required me to through a fairly efficient but inconvenient process to call Hotels.com and request a refund), incredibly inconvenient and they also made me pay for a second cab to get there. I would not recommend unless there was absolutely no alternative. The night manager was at least friendly and sympathetic but powerless to do anything.
1	Thank you for your Compassion!. My hubby and I had a 5 day stay booked at the Best Western Plus French Quarter scheduled from monday 10/29- 11/2 We live in NJ.....guess what happened- HURRICANE SANDY happened. Airline canceled our flight 3 times with me and the hubby now scheduled to fly out of Philadelphia international on thursdays, only to return home on friday. No thanks. Plus there's tons of clean up to do at home. Orbitz contacted Best Western for me and they are willing to refund our entire trip WITHOUT penalties. We will not forget their compassion and plan to re-book our trip at a later date and will DEFINITELY be staying at the Best Western Plus French Quarter. Thanks guys!
0	A bit scary at night.. Stayed here for one night. Saw suspicious people hanging out in the parking lot by the pool area. We arrived late at night. They were dressed with baggy clothes with pants hanging down their bottom. A car picked them up, then dropped them off minutes later. As I peaked out the window, I saw that this went on all night.... More
0	Booking in advance can cost you 3 times the walk-in rate.. Clean small rooms that are adequate, however you are given ear plugs to block out the city street noises. By booking in advance we paid 3 times more than we would have. We paid over 300 dollars a night! Had to stay the 5 nights as it was prepaid and they wouldn't hear of changing or cancelling our reservation. You do the math! Never again for this hotel.
0	unfriendly front desk ruins everything. very lousy front desk
0	Expected more.. What a disappointing stay- fell far below expectations, which weren't so high to begin with. The only thing this hotel has going for it is the excellent location. Otherwise, I found the front desk to be mostly unprofessional (with a few exceptions) and a little too casual.The room was comfortable and generally fine, in terms of condition, apart from the surprising lack of a safe! Having to store valuables with the reception felt inconvenient and outdated. The room was also a bit noisy due to a parking garage across the street that sounded a small siren noise every time a vehicle exited. Surely the hotel can negotiate this to be removed or install better noise insulation on that side of the buildingBut my biggest beef was the breakfast, which was simply mediocre at best and unreliable from one day to the next. Two of the three mornings, there was no fresh fruit to be had... and there was generally no healthy food to be found. The overall quality of the food reminded me of a school cafeteria and was very limited in choice.
0	Excellent Service from Everyone but Front Desk Staff and Park Shuttle Drivers. Breakfast, rooms, and all the staff except for the Front desk were great. When my family and I took a shuttle back from Disney we were dropped off 4 minutes away in the middle of the road while it was pouring and when we asked the bus driver he told us to f**k off his bus. No apology or anything. I was told by staff that I would receive some type of compensation (points, etc) however at the end of my stay I was told I will be receiving nothing. I honestly just wanted at least an apology for what my family had to go through that day and if Hilton is nice enough something else. Worst Hilton experience which is sad because my family and I always stay at a Hilton associated property because of the due care they have. Very sad by this stay and even more upset they way I was lied to and the situation was handled.We are sorry we were not able to provide you with a better quality of service. This is not typical of our hotel and staff, and we are always looking for ways to improve our customer experience. Your satisfaction is very important to us and we try hard to make sure all of our guests have a great stay. Thank you for your feedback and we hope you will consider staying with us again.
1	Great location, lovely hotel room. We stayed here for two nights as part of a 16 day road trip.The hotel is nice, all the staff were very polite and attentive. We were a little worried on check in about the fact that our room was on the same floor and directly overlooked the pool and bar area but we shouldn't have been - there was no noise whatsoever and we had a great night sleep. Only downside was we had to keep our curtains closed.......Nice spacious room, comfortable bed, great bathroom and shower, free continental breakfast at the hotel next door and if you sign up as a Kimpton member you get free wifi and a voucher for drinks at the bar.Nice touches were the umbrella and bathrobes for comfort. Great location as a base for San Diego - only downside was the 42 a night parking but we couldn't be bothered with the hassle of finding it cheaper elsewhere.Would go back there again..........................Hello SarahH81,Thank you for the lovely review! Were glad you enjoyed our location and rooms. Well see you back next time! JustinAssistant General Manager
1	This is a GREAT place to stay. We have stayed at this hotel for three straight years. We in this case includes myself, my wife, and our 8 kids. The kids have ranged in ages from 1 year old up to 17 years old (depending on the stay) and we have loved it every time.We have stayed in a suite each year and at least one (sometimes two) other rooms. The suite with the adjoining room is great for our needs.The location is perfect. Right near the Bart, right in Union Square. Need a quick bite to eat for a picky kid Subway is next door. Want a quick ice cream for a kid (or adult) quickly Cold Stone right next door, as well. And of course you are within about a 3 minute walk of 100 other restaurants of 35 different types.Why do we keep coming back to the same hotel with all the other choices SERVICE! This place just gets it. They put an emphasis on service that is difficult to find. There may be hotels with more room or for better prices. But knowing that we will be treated exceptionally well and knowing the staff will help us out with any questions or needs is worth the extra few dollars. My only complaint is that the suite has bathroom doors of frosted glass so you can see the silhouette of the person standing in the bathroom or getting out of the shower. Not perfect for a family, and also the door is sliding, no locks. Made more for a couple than a family, so communication is important to avoid any issues. Still, more than worth the minor inconvenience with all this hotel offers.Hello Mark B,Thank you for taking the time to share your holiday experience with us. It is ALWAYS a pleasure to have you and your family celebrate the holidays with our family here at AbRi. I am happy to hear you enjoyed the delicious spots next door to us and all our nearby shopping areas. Thank you kindly for your detailed feedback as every review helps us on our stride for perfection.As we say here at Hotel AbRi, stay vibrant!Warmest Regards,Daniel Novelly Front Office Manager
1	Great hotel for a short stay.. We stayed for one night after flying into BWI at 1:00 am. The complimentary airport shuttle was very convenient and the first driver we had was great! The second driver made us wait about 20 minutes while he was chatting it up with a woman that worked there which could have made things difficult if we were needing to be at the airport for a flight instead of just picking up our rental car. There weren't any restaurants or fast food within walking distance of the hotel and we were hungry after traveling all day, but they did give us some bagels and cream cheese because they felt bad. There really isn't much of anything by the hotel, but the beds were comfortable and it was a quick and easy check in. All in all, I would recommend this hotel for short stays like we had, but not for a long trip only because there isn't anything close by.
0	Not happy with my stay here. I stayed here with my family for two nights during graduation weekend. The hotel doesn't have elevators and we were put on the second floor. We asked for a first floor room as I have a hard time walking upstairs, but was told no. The hotel claims they are smoke free, but the hallways smelled like smoke really bad. The... More
0	Will never stay in a RED Roof Inn again. Absolutely the worse motel/hotel we had ever stayed in. No elevator. Steep unkept stairs. First impression upon entering, was very poor. Walls dirty, light switches dirty, dirty torn lampshades with mold in neighboring room. Sheets appeared clean. Bathroom the worse. Bathmat appeared dirty, when lifted it was mold from the underside. Floor, wall, corners, ceiling all needed cleaned and renewed.... More
1	New Orleans. Carl was great. Carl was the concierge and he helped us with touring New Orleans. The rooftop was the best part of the hotel. It had a stylish bar and a view of the city that you only get from this hotel Thank you so much for taking the time to share this feedback about your recent stay with us and we are delighted to know you had an excellent stay. You are correct in stating how wonderful the view is from our Monkey Board Rooftop Bar and also about the job Carl does as our concierge. We appreciate having you stay with us and hope to have you back for another stay real soon.Best regards,
0	Please don't stay here. I checked in and this room was literally disgusting. We checked in, and checked back out in 10 minutes. I could never sleep at a place like this. The room smelled of mildew and cigarette smoke. The bedding was stained and not fresh. Please go to another hotel, this one is not worth the hassle.
0	Definitely not worth the money.. The hotel / rooms are very dated. The a/c did not work in the room - the temp never got below 72, and was humid. My feet were filthy after walking on the carpet. Dining is very expensive, and the food is just ok.
0	Renovation needed badly. This hotel needed to be renovated 5 years ago. It is very tired and kept poorly. Mildew in corners of tub, poor bath amenties and so so cleaning of rooms. The high speed internet that they charge you 9.95 for is a total joke - super slow and almost unusable. As a business traveler, I would never stay here again.
1	Simply Wonderful. I love this hotel and its location. Our room which I requested to be located away from the street was honored with no problems. Jonathan who checked us in was wonderful! In learning we were return visitors and celebrating our 18th wedding anniversary, he graciously upgraded us to a larger room. The room was comfy, cozy and the bed was sooo comfortable, Slept like a baby. EVERY ONE of the hotel staff displayed wonderful hospitality to us during our 4 day stay. My only wish, is a shower with more pressure.You could not ask for a better location or a great staff and rooms. We will be back!!!
1	Satisfied in Seattle. The entire experience was great and satisfying. The staff, the facility, and the environment was very conducive and comforting. The free wi-fi was excellent, the food was fantastic and the proximity to downtown as well as to the Space Needle was priceless.Thank you for your review on your guest experience during your stay with us at the Grand Hyatt Seattle. We love that our central downtown location allows our guests to easily shop and explore all the great spots that Seattle has to offer. I am so happy to hear that you felt comfortable and relaxed in the room as making sure our guests feel accommodated is always one of our goals. We would love to welcome you back on your next trip to Seattle.Brenna N.Guest Relations Manager
1	Loved Bienville House. We stayed at Bienville House from 3/8-3/11. We thought it was wonderful! The rooms are beautiful and spotless. I didn't find the room to be too small at all, as some people have said. There were two comfortable chairs in the room to sit and chat along with a desk and chair. The bed was beautifully made, comfortable, and clean.The staff was very friendly and made great recommendations for restaurants and jazz. They also gave us directions to find things. Without a doubt, we'd stay there again for fun. My husband is planning to take his sales group there for his next big meeting.We are so pleased to hear you loved your stay with us at Bienville House! We hope to see you back here again soon for another great stay in New Orleans.
1	A 3 day Journey to get there but worth it. Didn't do a review for our March/April visit but our stay for July/August was just as good and as always its like coming home to Family, our Maid Ada is an absolute star and looked after us to perfection, all the girls in the coffee shop are great and even have our order prepared if they seen us walking up for our morning coffee, special mention for Whitney who was good enough to take us shopping one day, Suncoast you have lots of real stars working here that make our trips great and even harder to leave on our long journey home,see you all in March 2018.
1	Birthday Weekend. Lovely hotel with an amazing rooftop bar. The rooftop bar is on the 17th floor looks out over the city with couches and sitting areas besides a big bar to sit at. Rooms were decorated nicely with a touch of orange as the signature color. Bellmen and concierge were very helpful with good advice for where to go. It's in walking distance of Bourbon St but wear comfortable shoes There is lots of walking and sidewalks are uneven most everywhere you go. Of course, taxis and Uber are available. Thank you for taking a few minutes to share your experience. Happy Birthday!!! We appreciate you sharing your comments for others to get a feel of The Troubadour and our Monkey Board rooftop bar, we are excited to hear you enjoyed the atmosphere up there. The team will enjoy reading your comments and we thank you for recognizing all their hard efforts. We look forward to seeing you again soon, at least before your next birthday!WayneGeneral Manager
0	Would not stay here again. Although the hotel is in a convenient location and was inexpensive, the housekeeping is not acceptable. Sheets were not changed. Towels were not replaced. Sink was not clean. In addition, there were sketchy people in the lobby and hanging around the premises. Did not feel safe or comfortable. Would not stay here again.
1	Nice hotel with very friendly staff. We arrived late weary from travel and the check in was nice. We ended up with a very nice room next to the pool, but unfortunately the pool (and weather) was way too cold for us to use while we stayed there, serious bummer for our youngest son. We did get to use the hot tub though. Breakfast was very nice with a very attentive staff member around while it was served. Only downfall besides the pool would be the confusing layout that caused us to get yelled at in the bar for our kids being in there, because we thought we were walking into a restaurant.Dear Heatherby292jk,We recognize that you have a choice of where to stay when you are away from home and we appreciate that you gave us a try. I greatly appreciate your comments about the breakfast and our staff members. We work hard to make our guests happy and appreciate your feedback, and we look forward to serving you again.Sincerely,Mireya
0	Tower 1, are the Suites newer and better than Tower 2 the basic rooms. Comments about your Guest Room: Old beds covered in fairly used bedding. The box springs had rips. The mattresses were lumpy and past expired. The hygiene brand of products from bath and body works were great. The view would have been great too, but the windows were too dirty to see through.
1	Great Place. I chose this hotel from the other reviews that I read, and it met all my expectations. It was clean, nicely furnished, and the staff was friendly. It was also close to many local hot spots. There is no free parking at the hotel, but there is valet that allows you to stay parked until 6pm your day of check-out, that way you can continue to sightsee the day you are leaving. I would definitely stay here again, without a doubt:)Dear Jaime C,Thank you for staying at the Courtyard Philadelphia Downtown and for your excellent review. It was pleasure reading we met all of your expectations and that you and your partner loved our spotless property and helpful staff. Thanks again for the being our guest, and we look forward to seeing you both soon.Thank you, David KiddAssistant General Manager
0	Disappointed.. Bugs in bed, musty smell, loud and inefficient air conditioning. Rooms are dark and in need of deep cleaning. Unfriendly staff. Dark alley way from parking lot to the back door of the hotel. The work out area was used as a storage room. The only thing going for this hotel was the free parking and location to the trolley.Maureen,I am so sorry you were unhappy with your stay. We were unable to find any evidence of the bug you saw in your room. Ecolab thoroughly inspected the room, and found no insect activity. We did have the room treated out of an abundance of caution. I am happy we were able to change your room immediately, and I provided you with a discount for the inconvenience of changing rooms.The fitness center was being used for storage for a few days. We excited to be doing some upgrades to our public areas this summer. As a small hotel there is not a lot of extra room. I am happy to report those items have been moved out as of today (08/14/17)! Unfortunately this happens from time to time as we make improvements to the hotel. We made sure as much of the equipment as possible was accessible, and we would always be happy to provide a guest pass to a local gym if our storage inconveninced a guest. Melissa AlbertGeneral Manager
0	Only warm shower. I always stay at Hilton properties but I would not stay here again. If you like hot showers, go someplace else! Water was only lukewarm. I complained and nothing was done. Kitchen is poorly stocked. No slicing knives, only one pot and one pan.
1	Great spot for budget travellers in search of nightlife. I live in San Francisco and stayed here for a few nights in July 2013. Internet rates were 130/night, but I was able to get a (smallish) room with private bath for 80+ tax by asking directly through the hotel.Hotels can be pretty expensive in SF, average rate for a decent place is usually close to 200/night. I used to recommend the Elements Hotel to a certain brand of visitor (just need the basics, spend a lot of time out, location is key), but Elements is no more, having been converted to veteran housing. So, Tropica it is now, which is slightly nicer and a little more expensive.My room was clean and modern. At the back of the hotel, with great natural light. Bathroom seems brand new. Comes with mini fridge and microwave. Does not seem to be daily maid service. Free WiFi, which is spotty at the back of the hotel (they also have a dedicated PC for guest use at the check in window).If you like to go out to eat, bar hop, listen to live music, shop for trendy clothes, location here is ideal - it is literally surrounded by restaurants, with some of the most heralded - Locanda, Mission Chinese, Foreign Cinema, Bar Tartine, Range - all within easy walking distance. Too many bars, of all types, to mention - from Mexican bars with mariachis to some of SF's most creative cocktails. And live music within a short walk - the new Chapel, the old Elbo Room, which has had Sunday late night reggae dance parties for over 10 years, and one of my favorites, Amnesia, a quirky little romantic place with excellent, lesser heard music, from Balkan and Gypsy jazz to bluegrass, punk karaoke, folksy singer/songwriters, etc.Hotel is less than 2 blocks from 16th/Mission BART, which goes straight to SFO. Also close to Dolores Park and Castro.Tropica is not for everyone. I give it 3.5 stars overall. But if you want more than a hostel, and can live without full service, and being right in the action is important, this is a very good bargain.
1	Wow! Does it get better in San Fran!. The St. Regis San Fran is outstanding! Location is perfect, just South of Market, right next to the Museum of Modern Art, across the street from Yerba Buena, Metreon, and a short walk to all of the Union Square and Market Street shopping. The hotel is modern and sophisticated, but also really comfortable and welcoming. We loved the fireplace that greets you on the other side of the front door, and the lobby bar is super chic with a lively scene. We loved the indoor pool! This is a great amenity for a city hotel, especially when traveling with a family. The pool is warm and there are tons of windows and natural light. There's a poolside menu for food and beverages. Grill is the contemporary restaurant that serves seasonal dishes with locally sourced ingredients. We are gluten free and they do a fantastic job with this - lots of gluten free menu options and the gluten free bread was delicious. We saw the beautiful house car (a Bentley), but our timing was off with it pulling away each time we were hoping to catch a ride (next time!). We were in a Grand Deluxe Guest room on the 20th floor, and it was amazing. Beautifully finished with high ceilings, big windows allowing for lots of natural light, plenty of space, huge shower, soaking tub, and amazing views over Yerba Buena. My son said the roll away was one of the best he has ever slept in. Can't wait to return to this hotel.
0	Health Department close immediatly. DISGUSTING DUMP! If this hotel is an example of the Ramada chain the health department should shut them down. This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I shall never visit another Ramada hotel again. The room stinks. I am guessing the carpets have never been cleaned. The room was not cleaned. The bathroom is filthy. The tv gets 4 channels and stopped working the second day. The elevator does not work so all luggage had to be taken up to the top floor by hand. The phone does not work, the sheets are full of holes and the curtains smell. DO NOT STAY AT RAMADA HOTELS. I believe deseases cold be hatching in the rooms. Where is the San Francisco health department to protect the public Health department and tourist bureau start doing your job, SHUT THE DUMP DOWN NOW!.
1	Going to se my Grandaughter. My husband and I where flying from Orlando to Dallas, to see our new edition to our family our granddaughter. We got a very good welcome from all the staff there as soon as we arrived. Got a very good nights sleep (very quiet) got up and the shuttle to airport was on time dropped us off right at our gate. couldn't ask for a better experience.Dear Guest Yvonne R, I would like to thank you on behalf of my team for your kind comments on our performance and your experience on your stay. We know that when traveling our guests have many options to choose from and we value and deeply appreciate your loyalty and support. We want our guests to have the best stay possible where everything is like new, in place, of the highest quality, and in perfect working order. We are looking forward to welcome you, family and friends to once again provide you with an outstanding level of service and nothing less. Sincerely,Alex Blanco
0	Hair EVERYWHERE on the sheets and pillowcase... My fianc and I booked our last night in Denver here, we were looking for a good deal and have stayed in at least 20 other hostels internationally so thought we'd give 11th Avenue a chance.

1	My Best Hotel Experience Ever. Since I rarely have or take the time to reply to emails asking me to rate a particular hotel, item or service me seeking out your website to make my comments is telling in itself. My wife and I stayed in the Pentagon City location from 7/4/2013 to 7/7/2013. It was, in our opinion, the best hotel stay for us, ever. Every single member of the staff that we encountered from the moment that we pulled our vehicle into the check in area on 7/4 until our trunk was packed on 7/7 was friendly, professional and helpful. It was our pleasure to enjoy dinner in your restaurant on 7/4 and breakfast the remaining three days. Each meal was excellent. I would specifically like to mention Bryan Haley who took the time on the evening of 7/4 to chat with us at our dinner table. What is amazing to me is that Bryan and most of the other staff seemed to remember us and all of the other guests. Please thank your staff for a memorable stay. I would hope to stay at your hotel the next time we have the opportunity to be in the Washington, D.C. Area.
1	Great stay experience!. The familial Ohana spirit of Hawaii is exuded by the staff of Ocean Tower Hotel in Waikiki. My fiance and I have made 3 trips in total to Honolulu and this by far was the best experience with a hotel there because of the very warm welcome and service provided by the staff at the Ocean Tower Hotel.Leonor in particular (and as mentioned by numerous reviews here) made us feel more 'at home' than at home.Also, as mentioned by previous reviewers, the hotel is undergoing renovations to update and modernize their rooms. The renovations were not felt or noticed by us... there was no noise and construction people noticed during our stay 05/19-05/26. We got a personal glimpse of some of the completed new rooms and what we saw indicated 5 star quality.. tile floors, Asian influenced decor, new furnishings, state of the art TV and projectors, lighting, top of the line bathroom fixtures. Once available (by end of the year we were told), I am selfishly hoping the rates would not be too different as I would love to come back to stay in those new rooms!Everyday after an exhaustive tour or beach excursion during our stay, we were extremely impressed by the clean bedding, clean bathroom and air conditioned room we returned to. Not once did we have a single complaint about the room or hotel facilities. We did at one point need the use of a microwave to heat some food and the hotel staff was happy to allow us the use of theirs.
0	In bad need of repair and customer service needs improving. I don't mind old hotels as they can have a quaint charm about them. But the Bertram is in dire need of some TLC. When checking in (I was here for a wedding), the staff failed to provide me the gift that the bride had prepared for her guests. The desk staff was pleasant but moved on to the next... More
1	Very nice. Awsome hotel friendly staff just been renovated had an awsome view of alcatraz from my room wifi was very fast room where beautiful only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because they charge you 55 for one nights parking I found it rude as we paid top dollar to stay here other then that it was awsome :)Greetings Alex B,I am so glad that you found our hotel Awesome and our Team Friendly. The Z team works hard to ensure that we are providing a fabulous experience to all of our guests and glad you experienced that. Please be sure to consider us again in your future travels to San Francisco. Warm Regards,Jason WilliamsGeneral Manager
1	Great value. Nice, clean, well maintained property with an exceptionally pleasant and helpful staff. Area is sketchy, and no restaurants nearby, but great value for the money and easy access to 417. Our second stay, and we will recommend and stay there again, I am sure.Dear Lonsgal,Thank you for providing us with your positive feedback. It's great to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us and that our staff was able to enhance that. I do apologize if you felt any type of way in the area, I can assure you it is a safe property but, due to the convenience of being right off of the highway, the few restaurant we have that are really nearby are fast food or a 10-15 minute drive. We do hope that you will stay with us again soon.
1	A do again for sure!. My husband and I made our first trip to Napa recently and stayed at the Inn at the Vines hotel. We were greeted with a smile and the staff was very friendly. Genafer asked if this was our first visit to Napa and offered to gave us a few places they suggest we visit during our stay. Our room was quite and cozy and the beds were super comfortable for a hotel! Genafer and the other woman in the office were both very friendly and I plan on staying there again when I go back in October!Rhonda S - Thank you so much for taking the time to write such a nice review and we look forward to you and your husbands visit in October. Make sure to ask for me when you arrive and I will make sure to have more suggestions for you.
0	Worst rooms and room service. When I check in my room 150 it's non smoking room. When I open the door cigarets smell and worst tolet and AC don't work and I call front desk and said my AC is not working at 2:30am. Front desk person named melo he said they is no more rooms and said if I'm not happy check out at 2:30am with my family and every Time my son should go get towels everyday worst Maintance and worst front desk persons and I give compliant no response from duty manger. I guess duty manger have no responsibly to make guests happy in that motel. Make sure if they is no guests no motels in the worldI most certainly do apologize that we were unable to find you suitable accommodations, and of course we would not like for you and your family to check out at 2 in the morning. Clearly this type of service is not up to the standard we set for ourselves and this desk clerk you mentioned is no longer at our property. Again, i apologize for the inconveniences.
1	Convenient, Clean Easy Access for Disneyland visit. For a very quick trip to Disneyland we stayed at the Townplace Suites. The lobby and rooms are small but well organized and clean. The free breakfast was a hit but the small lobby can get crowded early in the morning as everyone heads out to Disneyland. Easy shuttle service from the hotel directly to Disneyland. There is a pool but we were too tired to take advantage of it! Good selection of family freindly restaurant and entertainment options right next to the hotel so all around a very good choice.Thank you so much for staying with us. I am glad that your family enjoyed your time here with us. Maybe next time you can take advantage of our pool area the next time your in the Anaheim area. We look forward to your next arrival.
0	Bad experience. Do not reccommend! Poor customer service the last two times I have stayed here. Bed and pillows are old and uncomfortable. Sheets do not fit the bed. Price in crease possible when you check in. Do not expaect great or experienced customer service...fail!
1	Superb place to stay. I had a week-end in this delightful hotel. The staff were welcoming, cheerful, helpful and polite. The two rooms we had were spotless and the beds comfortable and clean. The rooms are not big but perfectly adequate. There is a restaurant right inside the hotel and the food was excellent. I would definitely go back if I am ever in Chicago again, as will my son when he takes his wife. Hello totallynoname,Thank you for choosing Chicago River Hotel and for sharing your feedback with the TripAdvisor community. We are delighted to hear you found the staff to be welcoming and helpful and your rooms to be clean. We pride ourselves on both of these and love to hear when it shows to our guests. We look forward to seeing you and your son again next time either of you are in town.
1	Great Hotel Staff. What a pleasant surprise! We booked this hotel for one night (booked 2 rooms) because we had vacationed in Orlando all week but had an early flight going home the next day.......we wanted to stay close to the airport in a hotel that provided a shuttle service. Sheraton never disappoints us! This hotel had a great pool, great location, great breakfast buffet, but most of all.....a great staff!! Sandra Lady were awesome! They took care of us as if we were the only ones in the hotel.....answering questions on how to get picked up after we returned our rental car, to where we should buy the cheaper gas, booking our shuttle for the airport in the morning...just to name a few things!Kudos to Sheraton for having a great team......keep up the great work!!!!Our goal is to offer a comfortable room with great service when our guests stay with us each and every time.

Of course, your feedback is communicated to our team and both Lady and Sandra are delighted in the fact they were able to make your stay such a pleasant surprise.
1	Excellent hotel in great location. This was my second five-night stay for business. My room this time was a tad bigger with more shelving in the bathroom to accommodate my toiletries. This was a HUGE plus. Traveling in the middle of winter, the rates are phenomenal for this beautiful hotel and loop location! I'm able to easily walk to and from place of business each day. The staff is always friendly and attentive. The accommodations are above average in every way. The bed is extremely comfortable with high quality sheets. My housekeeper was excellent (absolutely the best I've had) ANTICIPATING my needs. How often does that happenWhat a wonderful review! Thanks for continually choosing our hotel and we look forward to seeing you in the future!Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager
1	Location, ambience and great service!. Located right in the heart of Old Town, the Best Western Hacienda is walking distance to all the shops and restaurants in Old Town. That means you'll have no problems with the 32oz. margaritas.Rooms are spacious and well-furnished with microwave, coffee machine, hair dryer and safe. The gym is also well-equipped with high quality treadmills and exercise bikes and a universal machine. There are no free weights but there is free bottled water and towels.The breakfast buffet was good but may not be included if you book through a third party site. The hotel is built on a hillside and some of the upper level rooms require some stair climbing. If you wish to avoid that, be sure to ask for a lower level room. Parking is somewhat limited. There is a covered lot that charges a fee for overnight parking or you can choose to park in the free lot on the corner. There are perhaps 20 to 25 spaces in the free lot so plan accordingly.Greetings, and thank you for the excellent, and humorous review! Im pleased to read you found our rooms well appointed and amenities ample. The breakfast buffet at the Old Town Tequila Factory will always get your day started out right! We look forward to welcoming you again. Heres to the new year! Regards,Ryan AguinaldoDirector of Sales and Marketing
1	Issue with Shuttle to Hotel. After arriving at the train stop having taken the train from the Baltimore airport, I called the hotel for the shuttle to pick me up. There was no signage for where the pickup was to meet the shuttle. Unfortunately, I didn't listen carefully to the description of where the pick up would be, so I assumed it was on the opposite side of the train tracks, and I missed it. Moral of the story: don't assume you know where the shuttle bus will pick you up. After that, The shuttle worked very well. In the room, the bathroom smelled funky and the air conditioning unit was noisy. The breakfast was very good, and the staff was friendly.
0	Not worth the money. For a Hilton the rooms, small bathtub, and noise in the rooms was horrible. I could hear everything from the room above me and rooms next to me. This was definitely not worth 234 a night or not up to Hilton standards. I would not stay there again. The people that worked there were top class though.
0	Good hotel but be very CAREFUL!!!. Stayed 2 nights Quality Suites Otay Mesa... PROs:- Very good value n great AAA rate - East checkin/checkout - FREE parking - FREE wifi- FREE good breakfast- FREE coffee in lobby - Very comfy bed slept like a baby- Good water pressure - Fan in bathroom - NO resort fee - Computer in lobby - Room pretty big n spacious - Direct TV n LOTS of channels a plus since we do NOT have cable - Clean throughout hotel- Felt safe CONs:- Paper thin walls (pick 3rd floor)- Room very stuffy - Very far from San Diego tourist sites (e.g. Sea World, Zoo, etc.)- URGENT: Please be very careful to check your bank statement BEFORE checkout!!! We got home after staying 2 nights at this QSOM hotel n they charged well over 400 (e.g. 3X rate) for 245 bill, but thank goodness AFTER making a couple calls to both QSOM hotel n my credit card company due to possible/potential FRAUD, fortunately, these charges were cleared AFTER 2 calendar days. Based on this huge mistake on hotel's part, we probably may NEVER stay here again. If it wasn't for this huge mistake, we would probably rate it much higher n possibly return, but possible/potential FRAUD is REAL n pretty concerning n scary. Hello Mrs. Lamp,On behalf of the staff Id like to apologize for this miscommunication, to further address the situation and clarify allow me to explainWhen a guest makes a non-prepaid reservation an authorization hold is taken the night before the check in date, if for one night the hold is usually the amount for the night plus 1 dollar, the authorization hold is used to guarantee you the room until 7am the following morning, the authorization hold then takes a few calendar days to drop. However if authorization is declined, after 4pm the reservation will be canceled if we have not heard from the guest.Again allow me to apologize for the inconvienence, we are in no way attempting to collect more than what the room cost is, and adhere strictly to hotel policies, including the Authorization hold, which has proven to be beneficial to our guest.My sincerest apologies for the misunderstanding, I do hope I was able to clarify and hopefully we will see you again at our hotel.I hope that you will consider staying with us again so that we can have another chance to provide you with a superior experience. Sincerely,Rajal PadhiarGeneral ManagerQuality Suites San Diego Otay Mesa619.661.1966
0	Never Again. The room is old and not taken care of. A piece of metal is screwed into the wall where the door handle went through. Pieces of unmatched tile around the tub enclosure not even cut correctly and God knows what was around the faucet. It seems they are only interested in your money and not maintaining the rooms.
0	Disappointed. Very disappointed in this hotel. This is the only hotel I have stayed in where the staff dont say hello when you walk through the lobby, friendliness costs nothing. The hotel is very tired, we paid for an ocean view and had a crane blocking...MoreAloha U6241ZVSTEVE, Thank you for the candid feedback.

1	Great experience. We stayed here on the start of our 3 week road trip across california and after a long flight from the uk this hotel was just perfect. We arrived after getting the Bart from the airport to union square then walking a couple of blocks to hotel at around 5.15 and was checked into our room straight away by very nice and helpful staff the porter guy took our bags for us and showed us to our room and mentioned the wine hour in the bat that goes on every night 5-6 pm which was great. The room was comfy and big enough for us with a good shower. Our view wasn't the best but it didn't really bother us a we were only using room to crash at night after adventuring around. Noise from outside was fine too. Could sleep perfectly well. The food in the restaurant looked good we had breakfast one morning which was tasty and priced well. Hotel is in a great location for shopping and sightseeing catching the trams to fisherman's wharf just perfect stay to our trip with everyone we can across to be friendly and helpful. Will definitely be back when in San Francisco again. JimmyD23,Wow - 3 weeks across California! Sounds like a great trip. Thank you for stopping by the Rex during this adventure. I'm glad to hear you took advantage of our complimentary wine hour - we think it's important make our guests feel at home. Until next time! Eric
0	too noisey. Close to the highway. Very noisey with semis passing bye all night. Beds need new mattresses. Won't be back. Had to climb stairs with luggage and cooler. No elevator. No desk help in the pm. No ice machines. Patio furniture very uncomfortable.
1	Plug your ears - planes on final approach. It's a Marriott so you know the quality will be good. Attended a conference there in the fall so couldn't enjoy the courtyard pool as the weather was too cold. Kept too busy to really get the know the hotel but the standards you'd expect were there.Great breakfast buffet - but then again you pay big dullas for it... no different than any other 4 - 5 star. If you don't like planes, then stay away. The hotel is right under the final approach to one of O'Hare's runways. As one of the busiest airports worldwide, there's a big one on it's way down every few minutes. I sat on my balcony trying to have a conversation with a colleague eventually gave up went inside - the noise from the planes was just insane. The upside though is that you get a unique view of the belly of aircraft at low altitude. Interesting, even for that experience.Dear Swazimac - Thank you for taking the time to post a note regarding your recent stay at our hotel. We are delighted to hear that our recent 40 million investment of the hotel is being noticed as the hotel is a landmark in the area. Thank you also for the compliments in regards to food preparations. I am delighted to hear you enjoyed the breakfast buffet! But Im sorry to hear that your past stay was impacted by noise from air traffic. Unfortunately there is the occasional day when extreme weather conditions dictate that planes land at lower altitudes and I believe this may have had a big impact with regard to your stay. However, thermal pane windows in all of our guestrooms reduce noise factors. Should you find your travels back in Chicago and wish to stay with us again, please ask to be placed on a lower floor inside room. And fortunately, we are almost through the most severe rains Chicago has experienced in more than 50 years! Safe travels,
0	Far Out. My wife and I decided to take a vacation to Seattle. Apparently, the entire population of North America had the same idea. The closest I could get to downtown was this SpringHill Suites. I wish we'd just chosen another city or another time.The suite was small, as with all such hotels of this sort, but was clean. As other reviewers have pointed out, there was some noise. The breakfast was excellent. The bed was hard as a rock and the pillows were abominable--even the replacements we asked them to give us. Free internet access was nice. Our main problem--it was a half- to three-quarter mile walk to any really decent restaurant. And the walk led through a questionable neighborhood. I was negatively impressed by the location, and would not stay here again.Oh, yes. We had a car (parked at 20 per night), but parking in downtown Seattle is a proble,, and quite expensive.
0	Very Disappointed. I was disappointed about the Hampton Inn Del Mar. My preferences as Hilton Honors member were ignored. The room we were given overlooked a Taco Bell and the freeway. Needless to say the noise level was great. The front desk staff simply did not care about our satisfaction. The lamps did not work. I have stayed at Hampton Inns before and have been satisfied but this was not the case with this hotel. On a positive note the breakfasts were pretty good.Thank you for your review. We highly appreciate your feedback and sincerely apologize for the issues that you experienced during your stay. We will be sure to take your comments about our property under consideration as we re-evaluate guest needs and continually work to improve our guest experience. We hope you will consider staying with us again the next time your travels bring you to our area.Thanks again,Hotel Management
0	Bad bad. We checked into this hotel and I was so surprised how much it has changed. We had stayed here several times when it was a Day's Inn. The room smelled so bad it would make you sick to your stomach. No wash rags so we asked the desk clerk and her response was I will have to call someone to... More
1	Elegant Hotel, Wonderful Stay. I highly recommend this hotel. I booked a weekend here for my sisters and I as we wanted to shop at connecting Lenox Square and Phipps Plaza across the street and to use the spa services from DASS Salon. We preferred to stay in Buckhead at an upscale hotel and this hotel fit the bill. The front desk and the concierge services were very helpful to us as far as getting us into restaurants. One of the staff gave us wrong information about the length of a Taxi cab ride to one of the restaurants, which ended up costing us three times what he said it would. The Valet staff did arrange for us to be driven to Phipps Plaza and back because it was raining one afternoon. Our rooms were very clean, comfortable and nicely furnished. We were at the end of the hall on the tenth floor (great views) with two connecting rooms and our own separate entrance/hallway. The Sunday breakfast buffet at the hotel restaurant was delicious and the service was excellent. Of course, we were tipping left and right but it was well worth it. Everything from check in to check out and in-between went smoothly. The snack/coffee shop in the hotel was top notch, you could get everything from bandaids to a danish. When I got home, I realized I left my phone charger. I called the hotel and they put me in touch with the Loss Prevention staff. They recovered my charger and sent it to me overnight at no charge.
1	Great Hotel and Great Location. I recently stayed at this hotel while attending a conference at the Washington Convention Center. This hotel is about a mile from the convention center but the hotel has a shuttle for free. My room was very clean and welcoming. My only minor issue with the hotel is the HVAC system in the room does not allow for fan on at all time. I prefer this while sleeping.Dear Hunterhersh: Thank you for completing a TripAdvisor regarding your recent stay at the Hyatt House Seattle. Please know that your feedback is extremely valuable to us and we will utilize your response to make every guest experience the best it can be. I greatly appreciate your kind words and they will be celebrated with the entire team. I am glad to hear that you enjoyed the location and our free shuttle. I will investigate the HVAC system, i am sorry that this was was an inconvenience for you! If I can be of any assistance to you, please contact me directly. We look forward to being of service to you in the near future. We appreciate your business! Sincerely, Jonathan
0	Poor Night's Sleep.... I was very disappointed in the Wingate by Wyndham LaGrange. I initially liked the hardwood floors when we entered our room- definitely cleaner than carpeting. However, it sounded like the guests above us were moving furniture around and doing some serious stomping until about 3 am. Carpeting would have muted some of this noise. Our room air conditioner sounded like... More
0	Old and dated.. Van that picked us up was extremely dirty, old style television gym, what a joke. carpet old and dirty, beds not supportive, old bottom line, everything about it old and needing major rehab close to the airport, thats about the only thing going for this
0	Bad. Me and my wife stayed at this hotel because she is a member, and the staff was rude during the morning shift, we asked to speak to the manager and he has not called us back, or toilet stop working, there was a spider in our bed, the big problem was not being contacted by the manager after serval attments...

0	Mr and Mrs. Our priority hotel is Hampton because it has been in the past clean and the bedding is claimed to be laundered after each guest. The Hampton in Lake Mary , Florida was not up to standard. The bathroom floor was filthy.
0	Disappointing.... The reviews were very good so we booked 2 rooms in this hotel for 3 nights. The reception staff was at best indifferent. We had booked a room with 2 double beds for our teenage children and they upgraded us to a king suite with a very uncomfortable pull out sofa. They did not try to accommodate us at all. The croissant in the morning was a bit stale. And the walls are paper thin, in each room we were woken up by people having sex next door almost every night...So apart from a good location and a decent price, I would not recommend this hotel. We did not enjoy our stay there....Dear Planetnat,Thank you for taking the time to review the St. James Hotel. I apologize for the mix up on your room upgrade and that our staff was unaccommodating. It is our goal to be your home away from home and unfortunately in this instance we failed. I understand how uncomfortable this must have been for your family and I do hope you give us another to chance to show you what our rooms have to offer! Sincerely
0	New definition for Dump. The only thing nice that we saw here was the pool, which looked clean and fresh (unfortunately, I didn't bring a suit). The place has very, very old and beat up furniture and was either too hot or too cold -- the heating systems are terrible, built under the window as in older cheap properties and then the beds are behind some sliding doors, so you have to leave those doors open if you want any cooling. The breakfast in the morning is really disgusting. They seem to have people making the breakfast who know nothing about what coffee is supposed to look like, for example, or what bacon strips look like. They had a whole container full of picnic bacon, which is just scraps of pork in no particular shape, generally used as bacon pieces for other foods. And here it is in their hot breakfast like you are supposed to dive in and just eat those bacon scraps as if they are slices of morning bacon. Not me!The coffee maker in the room saved the day for us, because it was actually much better than expected. In a general sense, this room was not the quality that we expected for what we paid, and we were generally disappointed. Complicating the situation, we asked for a wake up call at 10:06 PM one night, and they promised to call. We were never awakened and it caused some big problems. I hope the attached photos help people understand why they should avoid this property.Dear Lindaj99,Very sorry to hear you were so disappointed with us during your recent stay.our main goal is to make sure all our guest have an enjoyable stay.Sorry we fell short of your expectations. the hotel will be having a full renovation towards the end of March.We hope you will give us a chance to serve you again.Thank you again for your comments.Best Regards,Laura BensonOperations ManagerComfort Suites MV
1	This place is the real deal. I say it's the real deal because the place lives up to the positive reviews I read before staying here about two weeks ago. I travel to Miami about 6 to 8 times a year to visit family and I feel like I'm becoming an expert on where to stay for what. Technically, you could stay at this hotel and never leave the immediate area, and be okay. The place is clean, new, well kept, relaxing, with a friendly staff. The bathroom is pretty excellent and the room I was in felt enormous. (bathrobes included btw) The pool looked great, but it rained when I was there. I also saw a lot of space to lounge around outside if the weather permitted. Because of the design, architecture and foliage, when you're in the motel, you feel like you're in a private spot. You can't really see out which is nice. This helps create an atmosphere. If you venture outside the grounds, there's plenty of small restaurants within walking distance: the place is on a block with at least 5 restaurants to the south. To the north, things are waiting to be updated including 2 other motels. I think when they are done, this area will really come alive.I parked for free, which is hard to find in Miami. The neighborhood was safe, so I ordered from a few restaurants online and walked to pick up food. They were working on an onsite diner which I think would complete the whole experience when done. Location-wise, it's subjective. It's kind of off the beaten path in terms of South Beach or Downtown, but I liked being on Biscayne Blvd. And with a car, I could drive right up to the Aventura mall and the Gulfstream Casino, but I also wasn't too far to get to family in Miami Beach. Where it is on Biscayne makes it relatively easy to get around and you skip a lot of the freeway traffic. I'll definitely keep my eye on this place. I'd love to stay again when the diner is done and the weather permits for some poolside bar time. I'm also curious how this area will develop in the next few years.Thank you so much for such a lovely review and we do hope you return soon. The restaurant should re-open in early October as upscale Sushi so hopefully you can plan your next trip in the fall. The area has certainly changed since we totally renovated the hotel back in 2014, with only a few more buildings still in need of renovations. Stay tuned as the neighborhood continues to change!
0	When was the Poor Old Ac cleaned in our room Was bed or trampoline. My friend said he liked the charm and age of our room. Said it reminded him of a European hotel.Okay so it's 88 outside and same inside! Why two reasons One Ac is off! Two AC is clogged, and my friend mentions that it's a model from the 1970's!He had to find a way to open the front of Ac, then I took the screen and turned on the tub to wash it out. Which clogged the drain at 1st, I never knew a screen could hold so much dirt, this thing probably hadn't been cleaned for years! They need to get 2014 Acs. Other than the front lobby which was nice and cold the rest of hotel was broiling. The hall way reminded me of the place I live where its hard to breathe! Just terrible!I was thinking of giving this place a 3 but due to their low handed trickery I went with a 2 instead.The bed was hard as a board! I'm surprised I even slept. I woke up with a kink in my neck.Thankfully we did not come across anything bad that I read about...While I did see some care taken to the room, I feel the managers wishes are pie in the sky as far as improvements 2014 or 2016 etc. The bed was just horrible.Now my friend did mention something I thought was cute we got a double room with individual bathrooms, Both had big closets too. It seemed so same sex like both of these touches.The rainbow flag flew outside this hotel.My favorite thing is the tv was nice we had a 40 in Samsung. I bought a LG for my apt 2 yrs ago. Samsung actually looks a slight bit crisper or its newerLocation is what you pay for here! Although on their room key they have an ad for Domino's, walk down North Broadway and get real Chicago style pizza that was yummy from Renaldi's After Dark 2831 N Broadway StChicago, Illinois 60657 . I had the last piece of our large pie for lunch yesterday. I could only eat 3 slices it was so big, and the crust so thick.!I'm glad I gave Renaldi's pizza a try, I go to Aldi's to shop, and Aldi's had this brand Reggio's from Chicago that gave me heartburn the sauce is too rich and hot, but Renaldi's thankfully isn't anything like this. Really this was the highlight of my Chicago stop over on way back to NY. We went just before we checked in.As for this service Inn speaks of, thats kind of a joke! Let me tell you why...my friend calls on street by his parked car at 7 PM 7/21/2014 after we have eaten.At first lady can't answer his about a rate for tonight, he holds on for over 5 mins, then hangs up, calls back does it again, 3rd time they finally answer his I personally would've given up on this place after a 5 mins of non response. They need a 2nd customer service person 24/7!He asks for AARP discount and they give it to him for 40 off. So you think you're getting a good deal ....wait for it......parking....ahhhh 30 + tax to that...he states in NYC its 40 so not so bad.....anyway ..it costs 176 total for one night with tax after a 40 discount....The french toast was good, and so was the egg, it was cute how they cut up the doughnuts in half, for those watching their figure.... I thought it was nice to see my 2 milk I buy from Walmart too back home. The small danish was good and so was the choc ice frosted doughnut .There was a problem though after I ate some, I went into elevator back to our room 417.Instead I got off 3rd floor and got scared I knocked on 2 doors which I though were our side of the floor. You see they have a stupid ad for pizza on our room key but no room . My friend said they got scared cuz of the way the elevator made a jerking noise, this thing was probably never updated since the hotel began in 1910's, from what I read it was a Comfort Inn at one time, I wonder if it failed to meet standards and was dropped from the chain...Anyway my one encounter with the front desk was ok, I had to tell her his name, and got the room , went back upstairs, and gave him a hug when I saw him, this was a big traumatizing exp. To add to this I can get around Chicago without a map, and I last was in the city 20 yrs ago.I guess I just thought I wouldn't have to make a mental note of room.I don't want to write a book so I'll close by saying in a way we lucked out, cuz on Tues 7/22/2014 the Cubbies were playing a game so the hotel was sold out the rest of week!Even if it wasn't close to the perfect stay, I slept ok, and was able to survive the rest of day til my friend pushed thru to get me home at midnight!Thank you for taking the time to let me know about your stay. Please be assured I will be addressing these very valid concerns. I'm very, very sorry about your stay. Please consider staying with us again so that we can provide you with an excellent stay. Again, I'm very sorry and thank you for letting me know. Paul Schoonover - General Manager
1	Great hotel in good location. We stayed here for 4 nights during our travels around America and it was great!We were greeted warmly and they gave us a quiet room away from the pool where they played music in the evenings.The room itself was big and the bed was super comfy! They had a great bathroom set up for doing hair and make up and the shower was really good too.The staff were really helpful when we wanted an Everglades tour and the breakfast was a good add on with bagels, cereal and yoghurts to choose from.I would strongly recommend and stay again.Hello Amy, thank you so much for sharing your Vagabond experience and we hope you return to the hotel soon.
1	Hope to return soon. We were in New Orleans for Christmas week. Loved every minute! Stayed at the Bienville House, a small boutique hotel on the edge of the Quarter. Gawked at the tourists on Bourbon, listened to live jazz on Frenchmen's, rode the streetcars to the end of each line, and ate ourselves silly. Our stay with Bienville was wonderful. As with any property, the staff make all the difference. Kudos to Cynthia (front desk), Thomas (concierge), and all the staff who worked Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. The breakfast is enough to start your day. It is not a buffet. Hot/cold beverages, pastries, cereals, yogurt, bagels muffins are available in a small sitting area off the lobby. Tables are also available in the courtyard. I believe their new bar/restaurant Latitude 29 opens for lunch with reduced prices for happy hour. For whatever reason, the bartenders were less welcoming than the hotel staff, giving us the impression this was just another job for them. There are at least 4 restaurants on Decatur within 2 blocks, including House of Blues. We ate the Star and Evangeline's, both recommended by staff. Huck Finn's is also nearby for breakfast/lunch.These are local places, not at all touristy. Nice restaurants are within 3 blocks as well. As for the rooms, we had a 4th-floor double with semi-private patio riverside. Beautiful hibiscus and palms break the expanse in 3 areas. A 6-foot wall blocks the view of parking lots. The room itself is large and classic New Orleans with floral fabrics, a chandelier, and overstuffed chairs - Bienville is not a modern sterile hotel. The floors creak - perhaps lending atmosphere for its tales of hauntings. All in all, I recommend Bienville House and we hope to return soon.Thank you so much for all of your great feedback! We hope to see you again soon for another great trip to New Orleans.
0	Beware of hidden Urban Amenity Fee. Weve stayed at the Galleria Park Hotel a hand full of times over these past 10+ years. It's a nice quaint property. My wife and I were booked to stay there this last weekend (6/29-7/1/2018). However, upon confirming our reservation online last week, I noticed that a new Urban Amenity Fee fee was added and my new stay total was increased by almost 50. I was not contacted when this fee was imposed. I inquired as to what additional amenities this fee would be providing, above and beyond what was already offered at the hotel. Unfortunately, the General Manager Suzie Yang didn't feel it was necessary to respond. So, I cancelled and will not patronize this property again. It seems San Francisco boutique hotels feel their properties are worth the extra fee. Why not just raise the daily rate instead of adding deceitful fees We, instead, booked at the Hilton Union Square on O' Farrell Street. The Hilton was not only less expensive, they don't charge this ridiculous and underhanded Urban Amenity Fee. The Hilton has MANY more amenities and is actually located closer to Union Square. There are a multitude of restaurants and bars in the area, unlike the Galleria Park.Dear David S,We are deeply saddened to hear the Urban Amenity Fee has caused you to make the decision to stay elsewhere. We instituted this fee with the new year 2018 as a means to provide extra benefits for our guests.The 20 nightly charge allows us to deliver far behind the included amenities from the past. With our nightly sipping hour, we have introduced the service of gin martinis on top of the wines, WiFi access has been upgraded to higher speeds for all guests, all local and long distance phone calls are now available with no extra per usage costs, we now have phone chargers as well as portable power banks for our guests to utilize during their stay, water bottles are now provided without the high cost of the mini bar, and we now have passes available to be used at the 24 Hour Fitness studio. Our belief is to be transparent regarding this fee, which is why we disclose the added cost for our guest at the time of booking, in the confirmation email and once again reiterated at the time of check-in.We hope you will reconsider staying with us again the next time your travels bring you back to San Francisco.With warm regards,Jeffrey RosenkrantzAssistant Front Office Managerjrosenkrantzjdvhotels.com
1	Decent hotel, decent location. Spent the first three nights of a family trip here, using it as a base to see Legoland and Seaworld. The hotel itself is fine (we had a room with a bedroom separated by a sliding door for the children, complete with bunk beds), has a good outdoor pool and spa, and a decent free hot breakfast. All in all nothing sensational, but clean, tidy, reasonable value and - assuming you don't miss the turn off from Mission Valley Fwy! - in a convenient location, only 5-10 minutes from Seaworld and maybe half an hour from Legoland.I am very pleased you enjoyed your stay with us and you were able to enjoy our pool and spa, as well as SeaWorld and LEGOLAND. Sorry you had hard time finding our hotel our frequent guests like to remember that we are on the same exit as the Mission Valley Mall. Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us, too often, guests do not take the time to share their positive comments but the good service you experienced is what my staff and I strive to provide to each and every guest. We hope to see you again soon! Sincerely, Elizabeth Ming General Manager, Comfort Suites Mission Valley.
1	Friendly staff, great location. I stayed at the Ocean Tower Hotel for a week in early May based on positive reviews from TripAdvisor. These reviews were completely fair. This was an affordable hotel, located footsteps to Waikiki Beach. The rooms were clean and quiet the staff were friendly and accommodating. True, the hallways have tired carpet and the walls could do with some fresh wallpaper. But who cares about these trifles This was a great hotel. (However, if you are watching your weight, give the continental breakfast -- peanut-and-jelly on toast, danishes and donuts -- a wide berth. Fortunately, the rooms come with mini-fridges so you can store some healthier options which you can purchase at one of the many ubiquitous 'ABC' convenience stores.)
1	The BEST Find in downtown SF. My husband and I stayed on NYE and the best part was finding this hotel. SF hotels can be very expensive, this property was amazing the service, decor, amenities and best of all location was over the top. After I made my reservation I used the web talk concierge on their brands site (they have a whole collection in SF) and the online person helped me upgrade my reservation with a celebration package for just 30. We will be back and will definitely stay at one of their hotels.Dear Mcmorrison,Thank you for making Hotel Diva a part of your New Year's Eve celebration. I hope you and your husband had a wonderful time with us. We look forward to seeing you again soon!Best regards,Virgil LopezHotel Manager
1	Great Location Exemplary Service. This location is attached to the Lenox Square Mall in Buckhead, so easy access to lots of restaurants, shopping, and my downtown clients. It's reasonably priced and has full services--coffee bar, restaurant, room service, and pantry with snacks/beverages just off the front desk.But what earned 5 stars from me was the incredible service. Southern hospitality is one thing these folks raise it by an order of magnitude. A few examples: My colleagues and I had access to the club lounge for breakfast, and arrived half an hour before it was over. The urn of coffee was running out--so the concierge ran downstairs and brought us Starbucks. (They also have a self-serve espresso-based drink machine.) There are also a cadre of very nice gentlemen working the door to help with baggage and transportation. One day I walked in and the gentleman with a luggage cart jokingly offered me a ride--staff with a sense of humor! And the day I left, a staff gentleman in the hall saw me with my bag and was genuinely interested in how my stay was (not the kind of rote mumbling question that desk attendants everywhere have to ask). Net net, I felt like all of the team here really cared about me having a great stay. I'll be back.Dear Mary M,It was a pleasure welcoming you to JW Marriott Atlanta Buckhead. Thank you for mentioning how much you enjoyed our inspired and tailored hospitality. Our attentive and knowledgeable staff work hard to ensure our guest's expectations are exceeded throughout their stay. Thank you for choosing us for your visit to our beautiful city, and we hope to see you again soon.Best Regards,Eb MbyeDirector of Operations
1	Always Wonderful. We've stayed at the JW Marriott Buckhead every year for the past 3 years, with our most recent stay December 2015. I must begin by saying that this is one of the cleanest hotel properties I've ever visited, and I travel quite frequently (approximately every 2 months). Not only is the service great, but everything from the lobby to Nox Creek and the guest rooms look and feel absolutely beautiful. Hotel aesthetics aside, the property itself is conveniently located in the middle of Buckhead, directly connected to Lenox Square Mall. Moreover, there are plenty of restaurants within walking distance that are outside of the mall. If you don't feel like walking or if the weather doesn't permit, one of the hotel's cars will take you to almost any restaurant within 2 miles of the property. I will most definitely return this year for our annual trip to ATL.
1	Great night's stay. This is a great Marriott property if you want to be close to the baseball game. I choose this location as it was close enough for me to conduct my business, yet far enough away from my local family Centrally located and surrounded by eateries. Staff at this location are phenomenal and go above and beyond to ensure your stay is pleasant Dear Guest,Thank you for sharing your experience at the TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium through the Guest Satisfaction Survey.As a Valued Guest, we appreciate your feedback and are delighted to hear that you had a great stay. With a spirit to serve, we take great pride in not only meeting, but exceeding your expectations. Your feedback is integral to our ability to continue to improve our service. Thank you again for your time and come visit us again soon! Sincerely,Edgar RiveraGeneral Manager edgar.riveramarriott.com
0	Won't be going back. Yikes, the majority of the staff really give off a vibe that they don't care if you enjoy your stay. We are heading back to the area next month but are not returning to this hotel. It was noisy. We could hear the peoples conversations and the TV in the room next to us. We stayed for 6 days and 2 of those days we arrived home to our room and it hadn't been cleaned and restocked. All mornings we were woken up by the cleaning staff, vaccuming the hall ways. I have stayed in many hotels, at varying price points, and this one is definately not worth it. There are also a lot of extra charges that you don't expect. You also need a vehicle to stay there, and then have to use the valet service that was 25 a day, plus tipping the guys each time. It was an expensive stay, for not being relaxing. The website is misleading.The grounds were lovely, but that is really it. We loved San Diego so will just find somewhere else to stay. I should also mention that our credit card was compromised while we stayed there so when we got home, our credit card company's called to let us know, cancelled our cards and sent new ones, we then had to contact all the our preauths and that was a bit of a mess. We just received a letter today from Destination hotels and resorts (Estancia is one of their resorts) apologizing for the violation. Sigh!
1	Angel was great!. Angel was knowledgeable about the city and provided us with tons of advice. The room was pretty nice and clean. Heard they got a remodel and we really enjoyed it. Grocery store was right around the corner, room had a fridge, and we got a 50points to use LIFT (which were also great people). Only thing was a random tear in the curtain everything else was perfect.Lynn,It is delightful to hear that our accommodations met and fulfilled your expectations. We are happy to know our team also contributed to the value of your stay. Our staff member appreciate your recognition of their friendly and helpful service. The next time you find yourself in San Diego, we hope you consider staying with us!
0	Book in advance and arrive to no room!. We booked and paid in full a month in advance. We arrived late to be greeted by front desk telling us we had no room available. It was common practice to overbook. We spent 2 of our 3 days moving from hotel to hotel as a result. They did not even call us ahead of time to tell us to check In elsewhere.  Instead of a refund for the inconvienance the Manager gave us 2 free drink tickets and offered a free nights stay later. Horrible custom service and practice!
1	Great location. Enjoyed our visit and service was great! Appreciated the good restaurant recommendations from the front desk staff. Got the corner room on the 10th floor overlooking Petco park which was a bonus. The huge bathroom and super deep bathtub was awesome. Special shout out for Tina who was our room attendant who left us personal notes each day after servicing our room. Loved the proximity in the gas lamp, we could walk to so many things. We would stay here again when visiting SD again.I cant thank you enough jadoc for your glowing review! We have an incredible team here that genuinely cares about every guest that walks through our doors and I am beyond thrilled that you experienced it firsthand with Tina. I will be sure to recognize her for taking such wonderful care of you. Thanks so much for taking time to write. I hope to have you back with us again soon. Cheers! Shannon
1	Nice hotel...very nice staff. I was there to visit my daughter and her family, that live in Porstmouth, VA. The hotel is very close to them. I was able to bring my dog. The hotel staff allowed me to leave and leave my dog loose in the room, which was AWESOME! They even assured me that if he got loud, they would just call me. The room was a studio..plenty of room for us both. The hotel was refurbished a year ago. They offer breakfast each morning, waffles, fruit, cereal, etc. They even have snacks, drinks, for sale. Plus anything you might have forgotten! Love this place! I will go back regularly!
1	nicer than expected and great deal. This property is a good deal for the price. Room was larger and nicer than it looks in pics and was clean. The only problem with this place is the parking is limited and spots that are available are harder to get into. I would definitely stay here again.Thank you for choosing Ramada Limited San Diego/near SeaWorld for your recent visit. Our parking lot is more for your compact cars, so when a truck from worker stays with us it can throw off the spacing. We are continuing to explore what we can do to create more room for the vehicles . Thank you for your feedback. We hope you choose us again for your next visit.regardsBen
1	Loved the wharf. We only spent a day and a half in this beautiful city. But I will for sure be returning for further exploration. We stayed at the Limited Edition Ramada Inn on Lombard, down on the wharf. Clean and fairly quite accomodations. The man at the front was extremely nice though.Explored the wharf at night and in the day and thought it was fantastic. Did a trip to Alcatraz. If you haven't been I suggest a trip there. Beautiful and full of so much history. Nice day trip. As I said already didn't get much else in but that. For sure requires more time than we had to commit to..
0	weekend visit to Los angeles area. Convenient area to freeway in Culver City. Easy to book thru Booking.com. I chose not to stay after viewing room. Carpet needed vacuuming, mirrors with fingerprints, hair in sink, dusty furniture, poor quality of towels. Called Booking.com who were extremely helpful in talking with manager of motel. We received full refund.
0	Not yet ready for business travellers. 1. I did not like the experience of dealing with the Expedia person who assisted with the reservation. 2. It was annoying to learn only while checking out that this is a time share hotel. No one told me. 3. The WIFI was slow, and unreliable, cutting out from time to time. Also, when it tried to upgrade to the offered higher speed WIFI, it was quite an ordeal that took about 90 minutes and a call to the help line at your WIFI vendor. BTW, you might try the user interface for that sign up - it exasperatingly erases all one's data entries if a single one of them is incorrect (eg if you generate an unacceptable password) 4. The Business Center has two PCs that are excruciatingly slow, and a printer as well that lumbers along. Old, slow, out of date. 5. The single bright light in this business experience is that the staff were unfailingly polite and did their best to help. I give them credit for trying, and for being nice to me.
1	Great Hotel. Prime location - kids loved it - free breakfast is always great! My kids and I went to California for a Karate Tournament and this hotel was a great location to everything - we went to the beach, whale watching and his tournament and the hotel was in a perfect location - we will be staying at this hotel next time we visit CA!Good Afternoon,I appreciate you taking time to express your thoughts on your stay here at the Best Western Mission Bay. I am so happy that our location was near your kids karate tournament locations and you were happy with our property, staff and breakfast. Please let me know when you plan to return to San Diego, California. I will be more than happy to assist you with your reservation needs. You can reach me directly at 619-275-5700 ext 393 or Lpradohotelpros.bizWe look forward to your return,Leidy PradoFront Office Manager
1	Weekend Get Away. My husband and stayed at this hotel last weekend for one night. We were greeted by a friendly desk clerk, our room was very clean and the bed was extremeley comfortable. The location was perfect for SF - walking distance of Union Square, China Town, cable cars!I would highly recommend this hotel for a business trip or a couples retreat!!!Bring a bottle of wine to enjoy on the roof top garden overlooking San Francisco!!We are so happy you and your husband enjoyed your quick getaway. Our rooftop terrace is a pleasant retreat after exploring the city, so Im glad you were able to advantage with a bottle of wine. Thank you very much for the kind review and we look forward to seeing you both again soon.CheersQuinn McEnteeFront Office Manager
1	Great amenities near the airport. We stayed just one night on our way back to NJ from the University of Maryland, and decided to take the evening in Baltimore. The Embassy Suites is always a nice stay for us, particularly with the buffet breakfast. Hotel lodging and comfort were great, and the price was more affordable than staying right at the Inner Harbor. Rooms were comfortable and spacious, and the ground and interiors were classy. Would definitely stay there again for a Baltimore vacation. As you would imagine, this hotel is geared towards airport travelers and executives, and a shuttle runs continuously between the airport and hotel. I would suggest having a shuttle also running to the Inner Harbor, which would broaden the hotel's base of travelers by offering an easy way into the Harbor (and avoiding having to take the Light Rail service). Otherwise, everything was great.
1	Good Hotel But Don't Plan To Eat There. Estancia is a lovely hotel with manicured grounds. The rooms are spacious and very clean. The beds were extremely comfortable. The hotel itself is a bit of a maze and the staff are not very helpful in directing you to your room. We finally found our rooms and by the end of our stay we felt we finally knew where we were going. The restaurant where breakfast was served was chaotic. You had to wait 20 to 30 minutes to be seated even though there were many empty tables. Menu prices were average for a hotel. The server couldn't seem to get the order correct and it was 45 minutes before our food arrived. Unfortunately, we were not the only customers unhappy with the service. We could hear complaints from many of the tables. The excuse was a computer problem. We would probably stay at the hotel again but we will definitely make arrangements to eat elsewhere.Thank you for choosing to stay with us and thank you for taking the time to post a review. We appreciate your feedback regarding the guest rooms and grounds, and were so happy that you enjoyed the new beds. The hotels unique layout can certainly come across as a maze at first- just remember that you actually enter the property on the third level! We apologize for your dining experience at Adobe El Restaurante and will follow up with the food and beverage team. We are happy to hear that you plan to stay with us again and we look forward to it!
0	very nice but disappointed in the front desk check in service. We spent the weekend Of September 17-19th. The location was great and the hotel beautiful. I was disappointed in the gentleman behind the counter who treated my family and others in our party like we weren't worthy of staying there. We were well dressed and happen to all be very educated with good jobs and I felt throughout the entire check in process that we were being treated like we didn't belong. Maybe because we paid in Cash Surely because we choose to be debt free and not used credit cards we wouldn't be looked down upon Or would we
1	I LOVE THIS HOTEL AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE THE STAFF IS GREAT !!!. Hotels are hotels. You've been to one Hilton Garden Inn, and you could almost say you've been to all of them. Here the staff is amazing. They are friendly, helpful, accommodating, and all in all, a real pleasure to deal with, especially the front desk and the Bar/Restaurant staff. I have only stayed there a couple nights, but everything was perfect. The room was great, the food was wonderful, and as I said, the staff amazing. There are many restaurants nearby, and several within walking distance. I will be staying there again during my next visit to Orlando in September 2014. Highly recommend this place to anyone wanting a friendly and comfortable place near the International Airport.Dear Guest Frank d, I would like to thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to write about your experience during your stay at the Hilton Garden inn Orlando Airport. As you mentioned, Hotels are Hotels but it is the people that could turn a hotel stay into an experience and that impact our guests in a positive way and a job well done.We are constantly monitoring the performance of our team member to make sure our valuable guests as yourself is welcome with an efficient and pleasant front desk procedure that provides the accommodations and service you expect. We want our guests to be met with a well-trained staff that puts guest comfort and satisfaction before everything else. We are looking forward to welcome you, friends and family members to once again provide you with an outstanding level of service and nothing less. Sincerely,Alex BlancoGeneral Manager
0	Will not be returning. Room had a yucky smell, lights did not all work, each day we did not receive towels, workers at the front desk were not very pleasant to deal with and once we arrived, the rate went up from what we was quoted! Will not be staying there again!
1	Lovely hotel, fantastic location......slightly lacking..... Just had a 3 night stay here with a friend for a short trip to San Diego. Had a twin room in the Westin which was absolutely perfect - very clean, spacious and really comfy beds. Ideal spot near the Airport and walking distance to Little Italy, Gaslamp Quarter and the waterfront.We had breakfast included but what we weren't told until we questioned it, is the room has a maximum allowance of 45 for breakfast. As the buffet is 24.95 plus tax each, you will have to dip into your pocket AGAIN...sneaky...!!Also, our flight wasn't until 2045, so we put our bags in storage early and headed out for the day. When we got back at 1800, we asked if possible to have a shower and change before our 11hr flight home, to which we were advised we couldn't as no changing facility and just have to use the restrooms. I did ask about the spa facilities but again advised no showering facility at all.Very disappointing for a hotel of this stature. Would I stay here again, probably not for the reasons stated, but IS a very nice hotel and the location is excellent.chsparra - It is unfortunate to read your review and apologize your experience was less than expected, primarily focused around the breakfast allowance and shower facilities. Our breakfast buffet offers more than 30 options and several made to order items, allowing you to custom create to your liking. If you become an SPG member you would also receive a 15 discount off breakfast as well. Due to the various types of packages available that include breakfast we are unable to price match all the package prices for breakfast and try to find a fair and close option. We have considered adding a hospitality room to a future hotel upgrade to help us stand out from the other downtown hotels, however at this time, that is not an amenity we offer. I'm sorry this was a disatisfier and I hope that you will still consider Westin as a brand for future stays. Be Well, Alyssa Turowski, General Manager
1	Perfect place for two.... My husband and I stayed here for five nights for the San Francisco Marathon in July 2014. It was perfect for us. We were a little nervous about the location (don't be). It is in the perfect location, and fit our needs. We stayed on the second floor facing Fell Street. Yes, it is noisy with the cars - but we fell asleep from all our activities. The shower/toilet situation was perfect. We were busy during the day, and it was a great place to come rest and take a shower. If you are on a budget - this place is for you. The front desk were helpful, and were always willing to help with stamps, maps, change, directions, etc. Continental breakfast in the morning, and the best beverage machine. I would not recommend this place for kids, or the rooms in the center with the courtyard not facing the street. We had to move the last night, the room was smaller and it was hot and more noise came from other rooms rather than outside. Good thing was our last night we were there for a couple of hours to sleep. We will stay here again,you can not beat the price - especially in San Francisco!
0	Awfull place! Stay far away!!!. I am so sad I did not see the ratings for this place before I made 2 nights reservation. My family and I rented 3 rooms and what a mistake! One room had dirty sheets and we had to ask twice before they came and changed them. The maids did not seem happy about the ekstra work and for them where sheets with stains are apprently clean sheets no matter what. They even started to argue about it with my husband!The cable tv was not working proberly and the channels we could recieve was not even the same in all 3 room even though they where located right next to each other. Many of the channels kept on freezeing both the picture and the sound.No airconditioner in any of the rooms. The surrounding area seem quite dodgy, particuly at the back of motel. The homepage promise free high speed internet in all the rooms, but ups! That only works in the lobby! The beds are exstreamly small even acording to european standard! There are no refrigeater in the rooms. The window in the bedroom are plainted over with white paint so people can't look in, but several spots are free of paint and there are no curtain.Buttom line: I'm NEVER comming back again to this place!
0	not worth the price. Room need to be update shower was very dirty and also had water leaking I called the front desk and told them my issue no one came to look at it . sheets and blankets need to be replace. House keeping people are rude and don't know how to knock on doors
0	Not A Very Nice Hotel With Constant Din of Background Traffic. Had king bedroom on front side of hotel, which faces east towards the very busy noisy Cobb Parkway. Also, Interstate 285 (which passes right over Cobb Parkway to the immediate southeast of the hotel) added to the CONSTANT din of background traffic. The thin...More
0	Go to Motel 6 in Danvers!. We were looking for a place to stay outside of Boston and all the motels in this area seemed to be full. We found this one, overpriced, but thought we had no choice. We positively hated it and moved to the all-new Motel 6 for the rest of our stay. It was cheaper, much newer and cleaner.
1	Great breakfast, Near PHL Airport. Hotel location was convenient and GPS took us right there. Room clean and comfortable. We like Hampton Inns since they all have consistently good hot breakfasts and this one did not disappoint. Room with taxes jumps to about 180 due to high, unavoidable Philadelphia taxes. Still reasonable for the area. Could stay cheaper but the online ratings were poor at other hotels. Happy to pay a bit more knowing that we would be happy.Thank you so much for taking the time to tell us about your recent experience at our hotel. We truly value your feedback. We are glad you enjoyed our staff and location. We are looking forward to your next stay when you are in the Philadelphia area.We look forward to serving you! Thank you for making it the Hampton Inn Philadelphia Airport!
0	would not recommend. Arrived to find our room had a broken air-conditioner, the shower curtain rod was coming out of the drywall and the bathroom fan sounded like a jack hammer. the maintenance person could not fix the AC, there were no other rooms available, the windows did not open and it was like an over in the room. The staff did not offer to pay for us to room elsewhere etc due to the inconvenience. I would not recommend this facility. It was in disrepair. And as we were standing at the desk, a couple with 3 small children came in with a confirmation email and there reservation had been cancelled, so they had no room at all.
0	Disappointed. We checked in late Tuesday as we were in town for a funeral. We chose to stay here b/c it was close. First room key wouldn't work. The second one did but only that night. Every day we have been here we've had to make a trip downstairs to get a new key b/c they never work by the time... More
1	Best Location in Key West. This was the second time I had stayed in this hotel. The first time I stayed it was still under the Southern Cross Hotel management group. I chose this hotel the first time due to its location, but after staying noticed it could have used some updating however the location made up for that. Well now that The Saint has rebranded this hotel it is truly the best value in Key West with top notch amenities along with the awesome location.On this trip we stayed with family and friends and this hotel meet our needs perfectly. I do think this hotel is also great for a more romantic getaway. It definitely has that modern romantic feel, but also suit family's as well. Very well done.The staff is among the nicest we have encountered in Key West and they really go out of their way to make sure you enjoy your stay. We will definitely be staying here in the future and I highly recommend you give this hotel a shot on your next trip to Key West. You won't be disappointed.Thank you for letting us know how much you enjoyed your recent stay at The Saint Hotel! We appreciate your positive comments on our staff and hotel atmosphere. We are so glad that you found it conveniently located to everything! We hope you will come visit us again. Thank you again for your review.
0	Poor housekeeping. We stayed at the Hyatt House because it was convenient to the EMP, as we were taking a vocal workshop. The room had greasy fingerprints all over the microwave, chairs around the bar were askew, and the shower was dirty with large spots of soap scum all over it. We called the front desk and they asked if they could clean it the next day! We said, no, we are checking out then and want to take a shower in the morning. They said they would send someone up. I pulled back the covers on the bed to make sure the sheets had been changed and there was a plastic wrapper and a dirty wash rag. Needless to say, we went downstairs and said, please put us in another room. The next room was not very clean either, but better than the first one.kimbrleedo,Feedback from our guests is very important to us and we appreciate the detailed concerns. We strive to exceed all of our guests expectations and know we still have some work to do. Please know this is extremely important to me and I'm working with my Executive Housekeeper to correct any issues. Please let us know if there is anything we further assist with - we look forward to another opportunity to serve you in the future.Sarah Junge
1	Excellent Hotel in La Jolla!!. My family tells me my standards are VERY hard to live up to, but Estancia La Jolla Hotel actually lived up to my very high expectations. The staff were friendly and helpful. The room was very clean the bed was extremely comfortable and the bath was large and quite beautiful. Overall a wonderful hotel to stay for a vacation in sunny California!Dear Iditarider, Thank you for taking the time to review your experience at Estancia La Jolla. We appreciate your feedback and are delighted to hear that your stay exceeded expectations. On behalf of our staff, we hope to welcome you back during your next visit to sunny California.
1	Nice Clean Room. We really enjoyed staying in this room. It was very clean and the decor was nice. The location was not hard to find and it was nice and secluded. Area was nice and the outside was pretty. The staff was very helpful and happy. Overall amazing experience.Dear Isamarra: Thank you for providing us with your kind remarks. We are glad you enjoyed staying in our clean and nicely decorated guestrooms. It is great knowing you found our location convenient, yet secluded. Guest satisfaction and meeting with their expectations are important to us, so it will be our pleasure to share your nice comments with the entire Staff. Thank you for taking the time to write a review and we look forward to welcoming you back, so you may have another amazing experience!Most Sincerely, Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff
1	Small but comfortable and appealing. My mother and I came to San Francisco for vacation and enjoyed our four night stay at the hotel. The staff were all very friendly and we appreciated the welcome bag with water snacks and red wine. The room was small and the bathroom very tiny but the beds were comfortable and everything was clean. Decor of the hotel was nice and the location was perfect, close to lots of shopping, cable car rides and attractions. We did not eat in the restaurant even though they gave us dining vouchers because we did not find the menu appealing Greetings SGCanda84, thank you for giving us a 4 star rating. We are glad to know that your stay with us was comfortable. We value your opinion so I've shared your comment with the restaurant managers so they can revisit our current menu. Thank you for staying at the Hotel Abri. please come and see us again in the near future. Stay vibrant!
1	Did we just get lucky. We had a couple of days to spend in Chicago and wanted a hotel close to our car rental and to a train station, this place fit the bill. It's right in the middle of downtown Chicago and within walking distance to pretty much everything. It wasn't too cheap compared to normal hotels but all the other hotels close by were a lot more expensive so it felt like a good deal.It's a very simple lobby with just a couple of people in the reception and you could check in via a touch screen. There was a restaurant right next by but we didn't try it. There's plenty of restaurants and shops everywhere close by anyway.We ordered a room with two beds because of our kid and was expecting two beds close together, but we got a huge room which was pretty much two rooms in one with a hallway in between. It had two TVs and two bathrooms. I don't know if we just got lucky and got the biggest room they had for that price or if they're all like that. It was a great surprise for us and our kid could even play hide and seek with us!
0	Older road-side motel, simple, safe, near traffic noise. I was in town for a quick trip to attend a family event, wanted to save money, be near the event, and get sleep and a shower. The hotel staff was friendly, and parking was convenient and included in the room rate. This is a simple, older 2-story walk-up motel with rooms that face the parking lot, that probably hasn't...

0	Don't stay in room 102. Noisy
1	Pleasantly surprised based on the reviews. Was really nervous about staying in a hotel for an extended amount of time but my school is close by and my degree demanded I suck it up! Sue was such a tremendous help to me and she really made sure I got everything I needed as well as gave me some great tips for my stay in SD. I only wish there were more front desk agents like Sue and Darletta (hope I spelled that right). This is definitely my 1 place to stay when I'm in town. Thank you ladies! Fully loaded kitchen plus they provide dishes. Bathroom was bigger than mine at home lolI want to thank you for taking the time to post a review of your stay. I truly appreciate your comments regarding our friendly and accommodating staff. Im glad we were able to accommodate your needs with our fully equipped kitchens. The staff and I would like to thank you again for posting your review. We look forward to welcoming you back in the future!
0	Not worth the money. The room was so noisy we could hear every footstep from the people above, every toilet flush and every shower that they took. Winetasting in the courtyard was very loud and folks stayed after the winetasting drinking until the wee hours of the night . Staff was not willing to quiet them nor even leave the front desk to talk to them. Breakfast items in the morning were not replenished hot water was out replaced with warm water not useful at all . Rumors of free vouchers to Dennys never appeared .This was not a cheap property I do not feel I got my moneys worth I couldve stayed at a motel eight or six for equivalent valueOn behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you gave us to implement improvements to ensure we offer a better experience for guests in the future.
1	Hotel with Personality!. Loved this place! If you are looking for a chain hotel, THIS IS NOT for you. If you are looking for different, unique, friendly, fun...then this is it. We chose the little room with Queen bed, no windows..and it was GREAT. Best bed I've slept in while traveling in a long long time. Although there are internal hotel noises every once and a while..it was by no means disturbing or loud. Location was awesome! We mainly hung out on Decatour street/Jackson square/French market..but even bourbon street was a short walk. Hotel staff is very knowledgeable about places to eat and things to do. We didn't drive here so no idea about parking or valet. Staff was extremely friendly. It's just a super little gem in a crazy town.
0	Shockingly overpriced.. We paid 339.00 plus 50.00 tax for a room that faced a busy to lane road..plus the entrance to the hotel...and dumpster across the street. Not a the stunning view of Sedona. I was told that those rooms were another 30.00 more. I travel a lot and in all honesty this hotel...is trying to be something it is not. I... More
1	Worked well as somewhat budget option while attending a nearby convention. We were 4 women in a room with two double beds, in town for 4 days for a convention at the Town Country, happening just on the other side of the I-8 freeway. I'd say mostly positives for us! The property was obviously being attended to while we there, with gardeners replanting and pruning the day we were leaving, the exterior building was being washed down. Very nice plantings all about. Cafe, very satisfactory. Free parking very welcome. Our convention was only a 5 or so minute walk away. We were anticipating free breakfast with the reservation (was discussed when reservation was placed) but because we didn't have documentation of that, we weren't able to counter the front desk assertion that we did not have breakfast with the reservation. So be prepared with your paperwork. Just about once a day, 1 or more of us had our room key cards not work, so we had to go to the front desk to have them reset somewhat tiresome especially because we were housed in the furthest bank of rooms from the office. For the room, yes per other reviews, the a/c is set up such that it's an uneven situation, especially at night when sleeping. We dealt with it. Some sort of problem with shower pipes in the room above, when at 3 and 4 in the morning (!), a loud rattling pipes noise commenced, for a good 10 minutes. We alerted the front desk to the problem in the morning. The noise did not occur the next evening, but it could have been because then there was no one in the room upstairs afterwards during the span of our stay. Sure parking was very tight on the Saturday evening, but it was Saturday night, late we did eventually find a spot.Frig worked well. Plenty of towels. Room didn't at all seem overly dated. Beds were satisfactory. We indulged in the pool one late afternoon, but it ended up being the same time as what appeared to be a family reunion so shifted after a little bit to one of the hot tubs. Very nice nonetheless to have a pool and 2 hot tub options on the property. There is also a small gym facility adjacent to the pool.We would stay here again!Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. We welcome all guest comments especally when they are so well thought out. The Best Western Seven Seas is an older property however, we are continually upgrading our guestrooms, exterior, and other amenities in order to meet the needs of our guests. It is great knowing you enjoyed our convenient location and that it met your conference needs. We look forward to seeing you on your next visit whether for business or pleasure! Thank you again.
0	Clean, but not restful.. Not the most restful hotel in the world. The air-freshener made a bleeping noise every 82 seconds and the front desk didn't even try to fix it, preferring to let it bleep through the night. Then room-service banged on my door twice even though the do-not-disturb sign was on the door. Wi-Fi bandwidth -- was great, room was clean.
0	Great staff, mediocre everything else.. The staff was great especially the valet. The room had no sound proof. Drunk people in the hall at midnight and we heard everything. We were on the 7th floor and everytime someone ran over a manhole cover we heard the noise clear as day. The worst was the tub though. You can tell they had a bath fitter installed but there was water between the old tub and the new liner so it felt as if we were showering on a water bed. Who knows what was growing in between the two surfaces. Also our one pillow had a big brown stain on it.
0	Worst Stay EVER. What started out as a special weekend away for my boyfriend's birthday turned into a disaster. My boyfriend is a law enforcement officer and he and I reside in Highlands County which was the 2nd worst damaged county in Florida from Hurricane Irma. Since he was working mandatory overtime and we were without power for many days, I thought I would use my Hilton Honors points to find a hotel for our getaway.. Which is where I found your Homewood Suites. Upon checking in on Friday 9/22/17 we were greeted by the front desk clerk.. She was EXTREMELY nice and continued to deliver top notch services for us. We went to our room and discovered that we were given the keys for a double queen room. The beds were NOT true queen size.. We went back to the front desk with out luggage and when I explained that I reserved a King suite, we were told that there were not any King suites available, as they overbooked. I travel A LOT for work and I was surprised about this, and I felt that maybe they should have offered us a room next door to the Hilton Garden. We were not. The clerk re-assigned us to a 1st floor 2 queen and she said the manager would be checking with Hilton Honors to see what happened. She assured us she would leave a message for us after she found out what was wrong. After dinner and errands, we came back and there was no message, so I called Hilton Honors and they 3 way called the hotel and they said that they would offer us a room at Hilton Garden.. Well it was late at night, everything was unpacked and I did not want to go next door. Then almost immediately we were told that a King Suite just happened to come available, so we relocated to the King suite. That was 3 rooms in one night! The King suite was certainly not a King bed.. more like a queen. We woke up in the morning and went to the lobby for the hot breakfast (which was another reason I selected your hotel). The breakfast was not very good, eggs tasted funny and the sausages were not cooked all the way, and my boyfriend got sick, and my stomach didn't feel great either. Once we felt better we went out to Disney and enjoyed the EPCOT festival. When we came back to the hotel..hot and tired, we went into the room at 3:30 ish and the room had NOT been cleaned. I called down to get more towels so we could shower, which the front desk clerk had brought to the room and was so wonderful and apologetic. Housekeeping showed up at 6:30 pm after we were settled for the night. After showering I made the bed and discovered that there was not a blanket on the bed..it was a mattress pad..which explained why I was cold the previous night. We did not go to breakfast in the am and checked out. The weekend manager never spoke to us, never apologized and sent the clerk to do everything..Again the clerk was wonderful. So what started out as a wonderful surprise get away for my boyfriend turned out to be disappointing. I have been a Hilton Honors member since 2010 and I travel for work at least a couple times a month. I have never been so disappointed in a Hilton property as I was at your hotel. To make matters worse I found that I was double charged on my credit card today.. I had to spend an hour on the phone trying to get it straightened out.
1	Best Hampton Inn. This is by far the best Hampton Inn my wife and I have ever stayed in, and we've been in quite a few. For that matter, it's one of the best of its class among all of the hotels we've known. We had a nice, clean suite, quiet, well lit, neatly arranged with a desk/divider between the very comfortable bed and the sitting area. Staff were friendly and polite, the breakfast good, prices reasonable. Little notes left by the cleaners were a nice touch. Our only complaint was that the wireless Internet kept dropping out on checkout the desk clerk apologized and said that the hotel has been trying to solve this problem (our room also had an ethernet cable, unusual these days, but I hadn't brought an adapter for my laptop). In spite of this - not enough to affect the rating - highly recommended!
0	Bad mistake. What a bad mistake choosing this hotel. As a Platinum Marriott member, I thought that I could expect a certain minimum standard in service and accommodation. Man, was I wrong! Although I booked the least expensive room type, I expected a room upgrade, if available. The Marriott website showed a number of upgraded room types available, but the hotel refused to upgrade. I have never seen this before. The manager lied to me, saying there were no other rooms available, and had no explanation when I pointed to the front desk clerk, who confirmed what the Marriott website said about other rooms available. The room I was provided was the smallest room I have ever experienced...my home closet is larger! Worse yet, the room did not feel clean. The bathroom floor was unacceptable. Thankfully, I was able to check out the next day and find a much better hotel at about a third less. In sum, ridiculously small, unclean room with horrible management.Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We are disappointed to hear that you had a less than perfect experience. We will pass along this review to each department to ensure that problems like yours do not occur again. Cheers!
1	Very good hotel with brilliant staff. Stayed for 3 days with wife and son, all staff were superb. They really made you feel welcome. The breakfasts were wonderful. The location was excellent for the park and shopping. The staff were happy to assist in booking tickets for top of the rock, natural museum and zoo. Worth a visit.Thank you very much for your great feedback regarding your stay.Our ladies and gentleman take so much pride in the service they provide everyday and it always makes us, especially here at The Ritz-Carlton, Central Park, feel that we have made a difference in peoples lives.We look forward to seeing you in the future.Terry
0	Beware of special rate scam. I booked a special rate to include parking and 50 in food and drink. The hotel billed for both. Upon checkout I had to remind them to take off the 75 parking and then a week later I received charges for a brunch and water in the room. After calling, they credited the brunch, but would not take off the 3 for a water in the room (not included as a drink). Amazing that after all the hassle, the 3 charge was not credited.Nice atmosphere, but with this type of customer service I will stay elsewhere going forward.Hello dwyejj, Thank you for taking the time to share your experience at Found:re Phx. I'm so sorry to hear of the confusion around the rate you booked. I went ahead and made some adjustments to your bill. I also shared your feedback with our management team to ensure other guests do not experience the same issues. Please email me at mrykalskyfoundrehotels.com or call me at 602-875-8008 at your earliest convenience to ensure everything is correct. I hope you'll give us a second chance next time you're staying in the Phoenix area.Thanks!
0	Not child friendly. We spent about 16-17 hours traveling 1,000s of miles before reaching the hotel. It was our first time in California as a family and the first time we had traveled that far with our toddler. We got to our hotel room at 8:00 that night and were getting settled in when we had a knock on our door. We were... More
1	nice hotel for a great price. We stayed at Club Quarters in December.We were in town for the weekend to see Wicked.Its a very nice hotel in a great location. We were one block off of Michigan Ave and about 5 blocks from the theater district.If you're looking for a high end hotel this is not the hotel for you Yes the rooms are small but how long are you really in your roomThe rooms were clean and thats really most important.When we arrived at 1230pm we were able to check in.We were told we could valet park for 36.00 or for 20.00 we could park for a 24 hour time limit in a parking garage right down the street.We opted for the 20.00 option. MAKE SURE YOU GET A TICKET!!!My husband did not get a ticket at the parking garage and when he inquired about it at the office in the parking garage the girl told him not to worry about it.Well on Sunday morning when he tried to get our car back it was an issue. You have to have a ticket to be able to get your car back. After about 15 minutes the issue was resolved and we got our car back.The entire staff was very helpful including the doorman. He was very helpful in getting us a cab. He ran down at least a block and flagged down a cab, he got in the cab with the driver and came back to the hotel so we could get our cab. It was a very nice thing to do considering the day we were there it was sleeting and raining and everyone in chicago was trying to get a cab at the same time.After reading all the bad reports on his hotel we were debating on switching to a different hotel.We never waited for an elevator, the rooms were clean, the location was great.Im glad we stayed here. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a resonable priced hotel near Michigan Ave.
0	Please Condemn!!. By far the most disgusting place I have ever seen let alone slept in and I wouldn't have stayed more than 10 seconds if it wasn't paid for by work... 2 nights in a room with blood in the bathroom, crusty stains on floor and mold in shower was scary.
0	Nice staff but niether clean nor safe place. Th price was cheap but the whole area doesn't look safe or proper for a family. The room looks clean but it smells. The only person staff that I found was nice and polite. There are many mechanic shops in this area.

So this place is filthy and gross......not to mention the needle that was found in my room....when management was informed they said they would remove it.....I asked for my money back and was denied anything...I told them I have pictures and video of this needle that I will post online...they said go ahead and call the police while I was...

0	The Upgrade that was really a Downgrade. My sister and I booked a room at the Ritz-Carlton in July 2016 for October 29, 2016 when we would be in town for a concert. This was going to be a real treat to spend 400 on a hotel room, but it turned into...MoreDear Suzanne, I am terribly sorry for your poor experience and appreciate you sharing your concerns. We have been communicating with your sister in law to make amends for the opportunities. Obviously none of this should have occurred. Sincerely,
0	Slight Improvement needed. I was unhappy with the service for the room. One nite I had to go to the front desk for shampoo etc. because none were restocked. Then I get ready to shower and no washcloths. Were there. Another trip. We have stayed here for at least 4 years and this was a firstThank you for taking the time to let us know about your concerns with our BRAND. I have discussed this situation with my entire staff to ensure it is not repeated. We assure you this kind of incident is not the way we conduct business. Our goal is to provide a level of service that requires diligent attention to detail and is a matter of constant reinforcement of our hotel. Once again, we are truly sorry for the inconvenience we caused you. If there is anything else we can assist you with in the future, please don't hesitate to call. We look forward to having you as our guest in the future.Willis Blake DOS
1	Business Trip. This hotel is very close to the office we were holding our meeting. I was on the 8th floor, about four rooms off the elevators and it was fairly quiet. Nice, comfy beds and decor. I had a walk-in shower that was nice. The concierge level suite was good which I visited during hors d'eorves hour before our 7:30pm dinner reservations and also again in the morning for breakfast. There was an excellant spread available with many juice options. I particularily enjoyed that the lamps wall sockets in the room had USB ports to charge your phone/Kindle etc. The cost of the room seemed pretty steep, but I enjoyed my stay overall. Shuttle service from O'Hare was prompt and I think comes every 20 minutes.
0	Ok hotel but I will not go back.. We stayed here on Sunday night. My husband is very sick with cancer and was rushed to the VA hospital. The very sweet girl working at the desk was nice enough to give us the hospital discount. However, the battery in our car died when we got there and so i called the very helpful man working overnight and got... More
0	Not Good. There was much to be desired. Air cond. didn't work well. No cups in bathroom. The housekeeping employees woke us up. we were not ready to get up before 8 A.M.
1	Great Room. The room was really big and clean. The staff was great. The hotel offers free breakfast that was really good ( not the usual crappy free breakfast) The only thing I didn't like about the room was that the air conditioner was regulated a motion sensor. We happened to be staying here on one of the hottest days of the year. The unit only stays on if the motion censor registers a person being in the room. Upon arriving the room was hot. It took about 20 mins for it to cool off. Also the AC cut off during the night when we fell asleep (No movement). I woke up in a pool of sweat and had to get up a walk around periodically to keep the AC going. That really sucked..
1	Great stay at Aloft Philly Downtown. When we arrived, our 2-queen room had not been prepared. The staff gave us 2 1-king rooms for the first night, then moved us to a 2-queen room for the second night. They were very helpful in scheduling our move and handling our bags. Well done!Hi 429,Thanks for the FIVE BUBBLES!!!! Sorry we didn't have the two bed room available upon your arrival, that sometimes happens in our biz. Glad we were able to overcome and create a great experience for you. Hope to get back soon, there's still plenty of summer left to play! Evan
1	Art Deco heaven. High points The Allegro hotel is like going back in time. The lobby is beautifully restored art Deco with modern amenities. Fireplace is wonderful and there are multiple seating areas. Staff is friendly, attentive and efficient. Rooms are spacious, small bathrooms but excellent water pressure in shower. Beds and pillows excellent. Hotel robes are luscious. Low point:Virtually no closet since it is about 6 inches deep and clothes must hang sideways.Extra points Complimentary bubbly in lobby in afternoon!Thanks for the great review! We're pleased to see you enjoyed your stay with us and took the time to mix and mingle during our complimentary social hour! Come back to see us again soon!Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager
0	Old building.. It needs to be renovated.
0	Worst Hampton in the world. Looking for an awful experience at a nasty hotel, this south Orlando Hampton in is for you. Not only will you be hasseled by complete incompetence, the manager (ha, what a joke Natoya Edwards is) will blindly defend her dump then lie to your face and her suoeriors. Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else
0	Never Again !. our family of four stayed the Easter weekend at this hotel and were surprised at the lack of quality for the price.The sheets had stains on them, bathroom was dirty old and there was trash along the bottom of the beds and behind the bedside table.Carpet was filty.Worst of all, THE NOISE LEVEL WAS UNBEARABLE !!! Brochure online pictures show rooms with balconies, no balcony!Parking is extra and if you are not happy with your stay and want to leave early, they charge you an early checkout fee ! They brag on the renovation they just had. Our family can only wonder what condition was this place in before undergoing such a huge renovation they speak of.I think they spent it on wall paper and carpet.We have lived in New Orleans have also visited many times since moving away. The online pics of this place drew us in and the brochure was nice, but don't let it fool you.NEVER again will we stay there!!!!
1	Do not arrive at peak check-in time!. My wife and I have stayed at the Drury Inn New Orleans several times in the past and find the location, service, cleanliness and value to far exceed the competition. The staff and facilities are top notch. We booked two king suites for six guests pre-cruise and loved our rooms. However, until the valet area is complete, we may have to look elsewhere. We were trying to assist our elderly parents, our two children, and lots of luggage and feel the unloading area being used is very unsafe during peak times. There just isn't enough room to handle the volume of traffic. This was a very stressful situation before we even checked in. I am still rating our stay with 5 stars because the staff deserves it. Management needs to address the off street unloading problem!
1	Clean and comfortable. The Travelodge in downtown Phoenix is an architectural gem. It still has the 1960s Googie exterior design, a definite attraction. The hotel grounds are very clean, so was my room. There is a cute patio area with outdoor carpeting and lights. The price is right if you just want a comfortable bed and hot shower. The WiFi is free and the TV works well. Restaurants are within walking distance, including a McDs next door if you go for that kind of cuisine. Judy,That your stay was wonderful and it was clean for you and everything was walking distance. Yes, we do over best to satisfied every person.
1	Great hotel. Great location.. This was our second stay at the Pearl and we will for sure be back. Love the funky decor.Very friendly and helpful staff at both the hotel and the bar/restaurant. You have git to get the doughnuts for desert!The first time we had the gem room which was a bit small. This time we had a jewel room and it was the perfect size. A BIG BIG thank you for your fantastic review. We truly appreciate you. It is very gratifying when we have guests return for the second, third, fourth time. Please come back soon. Make it a great day.
0	Do not park here!. You just have to read some of the other reviews for this place to realize that there are some major shortcomings in its management. Clearly not indicative of the Westin brand. We made the mistake of not researching the hotel before making a parking reservation after Christmas. Cutting to the chase, our car was broken into in the garage while we were away (as was the car parked next door). We arrived back late at night to find plastic taped over the window and glass everywhere. The security guard at the hotel showed us a police report and told us that two suspects were arrested, gave us the name and number of the GM and sent us on our way. It is now March - our calls to the GM have never been returned - voicemail every time. 297 out of pocket for replacing the glass in the passenger window plus the cost of items stolen, but we don't have a copy of the police report to pass along to our insurance agent because the hotel management appear not to give two craps about a) what happens at this property, and b) basic customer service. Do yourself a favor and find an alternative.On behalf of the hotel we apologize for the unfortunate incident with your car. You can obtain a copy of the police report by contacting the College Park Police Department at 404-761-3131.
0	Don't stay Atlantic City NJ. Best Western on Pacific Ave Atlantic City NJ was dirty, bad section of town, in fear of our families safety. Never again, I always stay at Best Westerns , never a problem, but stay away from this one.
1	Loved this Hotel!. This hotel was beautiful had amazing views!! I loved how they provided a nice shuttle to pick you up from airport for free. The staff were extremely friendly upon arrival.They upgraded me to a room with a view over the bay,free of charge since it was my first time visiting! The view was amazing too,again! The beds were heavenly I will be back! Ps. Food was also amazing! Must get their ice cream brownie split ) Kayla M,It is wonderful to hear that we could help make your first visit to San Diego a memorable one. I am happy to hear that our location, views, service and food exceeded your expectations. Thank you for your review and I look forward to welcoming you back.Remain Well,Alyssa TurowskiGeneral Manager
0	Scary neighborhood!. It was mistake.... The hotel itself was not too bad, but the location was bad. Scary neighborhood! I do not recommend this hotel for family. We didn't want to walk around the hotel in night time, so we stayed in the hotel room.
1	Quiet off the strip hotel. We spent several nights at this hotel. We loved the location about 8 miles away from the strip, but easy drive. You do need a car if you stay at this property. It is far from most everything else. Plenty of places to eat in the area. Located in a beautiful place near golf course. We had a nice view of the mountains and Las Vegas strip. We found it quiet at night, even though we were there over a weekend, and there were families with young children staying at the hotel. The hotel staff was very friendly, and helpful. We found our room to be large, and clean. Bathroom was large and had double vanity. It is not the most fancy of rooms, but it had everything we needed. A fridge, coffee maker, flat screen TV. We ate at a couple of the restaurants in the hotel and they were good, the buffet breakfast was very good variety for the money. We saw a show at the showroom, every seat is a good one. We used the pool which was very nice, not the biggest one but nicely decorated and plenty of seats. Overall very happy and would stay again.
0	Ran down property. Hotel staff very nice, hotel is confusing to get around. Restaurant is inconsistent one meal excellent next bad.overall I would not stay again. The trolly is close so easy to get around San Diegos hot spots.Thank you for your detailed feedback on your recent stay with us. While it sounds like there were several positive aspects to your stay such as our location and attentive service, it sounds like there were a few areas with room for improvement as well. Were continuously updating and improving aspects of our property and use guest reviews to direct our future efforts. We hope that well have another opportunity to win your loyalty! Regards,Ryan AguinaldoGeneral Manager
1	First trip to Seattle. W Hotel is a fun and energized hotel because its design. I like W's location and the Bar because I can easily go to many stores and the pike place, and I can enjoy my drink while I enjoy the music, which denoted by DJ. I believe you would fall in love with this young energy musical style W Hoel. Hello Erica C, we are so pleased that you enjoyed your first trip to Seattle, and that you decided to stay with us on your first trip! We agree with you on the location of the hotel, so close to so many of Seattle's hotspots! We do hope you will come back to Seattle and stay with us again! Thank you!
1	Pretty good overall.. Overall, our stay was enjoyable. Right away, we did notice the remote didn't work, so I asked the front desk for some new batteries. They provided them, but the remote still wouldn't turn the TV on. Finally, after tapping the remote on the table, it started working. The room condition was good, and the beds were comfortable. Something that seemed unsanitary, however, was at breakfast, we found a hair on a spoon for the eggs. We showed one of the people behind the counter, but all she did was take the hair off the spoon. That was an uncomfortable situation.
1	Worth the visit. This hotel is close to the Willis tower and millennium park. If your happy to walk navy pier is about 30 mins away. This hotel is on Adams street which is also the start of route 66. The hotel itself is clean comfortable and the staff are friendly. The room was cleaned daily and extra pillows were provided on request. There is free washing and ironing facilities along with chilled water and ice machines located on each floor. Our room had a fridge and microwave and basic kitchen supplies. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.Dear Louise RIt was great to read that you would stay with us again - what better compliment could you offer !Glad that you enjoyed the many complimentary amenities that we offer and the secret is always to ask if you need anything - we are there to look after you and will do anything to make sure your stay is comfortable and enjoyable .Kind regardsPaul Tiernan - Hotel MAnager
0	Not very good. Although the hotel was close to MDW, the hotel was pretty old. The carpet in our room was pretty bad, it was sticky and needed immediate replacement. The furniture had seen better days. I didn't think it was worth the money we paid. The hotel certainly needs TLC in many areas to keep it competitive. They were charging 8.50 for breakfast. They could have included that in the price we paid for the room. That is not a big deal but the carpet is. The noise level was also high as it is right next to the main thoroughfare.
1	Great Hotel, Valet Parking can be Slow. Great hotel in the heart of Union Square at a very reasonable rate. We were attending an event at ATT park and Earlier that day we devided to stay in the SF overnight. The Marquis had rooms available, at a great rate and close to ATT (9.00 UBER ride). The hotel is beautiful and our room was immaculate. Staff is very friendly and kind. The only negative was on the day of our arrival, we waited on Mission Street for an hour to have valet park our car. The valet attendants were very apologetic and the desk clerk upon hearing how long it took, gave us an early check-in. I would most definitely stay here again!
0	The hotel doors hardly close and open very well. There was.... The hotel doors hardly close and open very well. There was a couple next-door that plays music very loud and you could smell marijuana coming through the room. The front desk that was not very friendly .
0	Booked room No room. Was travelling down to San Francisco on business and booked two hotel rooms at the last minute - all paid and confirmed...or so we thought. We showed up in a rush between meetings and the front desk informed us that we didn't have rooms any more because the people staying in our rooms had extended their stay! Hotel was supposed to find us rooms elsewhere but we ended up scrambling to find two other rooms. Disappointed as we always like to try and find the hidden jewel but this time we certainly found something else. Guess squatters rights still exist in San Francisco!Dear Nathan M-Let me first say that I appreciate you taking the time to provide feedback following your recent experience with us. Secondly, let me apologize and say that I wish that we were able to have accomodated you and your colleague at the Hotel Abri. Not being able to honor a reservation for a guest is the least desireable and most difficult situation for the hotel as well as the guest. We had a group of rooms extend that caused us a bit of a situation. I believe that when you arrived we were in the middle of securing accomodations for you at a neighboring hotel, but I understand how disappointing this was as you had already picked the Abri and we were unable to welcome you in the way we wish we could have. I hope that when your travels return you to San Francisco, you will give us a second chance. Please feel free to contact me or the hotel directly for future reservations, as we have a lowest rate guarantee, and always offer the lowest rate available thru any booking channel. Thanks again for your feedback!Yours in hospitality-Rob BrehantGeneral Managerrob.brehantmetwestterra.com
1	Nice Hotel, Good Value. Three of us recently stayed here during the Women's Final Four. The hotel decor was lovely and the staff was more than accommodating. We had a two room suite. The rooms were quite large and the ceilings were very high so it was extremely quiet. We also appreciated that the sink vanity area were outside the bathroom since there were three of us.The free breakfast was mediocre in my opinion and the 5:30 kickback was great for families, but with so many fantastic New Orleans restaurants I wasn't about to fill up on chips, hot dogs, mac and cheese, etc. The location is within walking distance of the New Orleans Arena and the French Quarter, but because of a knee injury that wasn't possible for me. The hotel is very secure. A hotel key is needed to access the elevator. There is a great grocery store within a couple of blocks for anything you may need.
0	Skip this location. Keep driving! The other family that we were traveling with booked and paid for this room far in advance. We arrived without the other family and was given a room on the second level. When my husband and I exited the elevator with our luggage the entire length of the hall smelled like a skunk had run down it. It... More
1	Great customer service and good value for the location. We stayed here for 3 nights in September. We arrived early and in a bit of a rush to get ready for a wedding. The hotel staff was very helpful in getting our room ready early for us. It's always nice when a hotel goes a little extra to help out, great customer service! We stayed in a standard king size room, which was spacious with a couch/sitting area.The room was quiet, we never really heard any noise from outside or from neighbors. There isn't a breakfast option, but there is a Denny's attached to the hotel and they give you 6 off per person coupons to use each day.We went to wineries in St. Helena and Oakville, the travel times varied between 20-30 mins. We ate dinner in Napa and it was just a few minutes drive to plenty of places. Overall, based on the location, price and customer service, I would recommend this hotel.Jdiddy78 - Thank you for such a kind review. We strive on incredible customer service and do everything we can to make sure you are satisfied with your stay. I'm glad we could get you into your room early to get ready for the wedding you were attending and we hope next time you're in our area you will come and stay with us again. Cheers, Genafer, Director of Sales
1	Location is perfect. My other half and I always enjoy Aloft hotels wherever we go for the modern decor, pet friendliness, and good value. Downtown Philadelphia is no exception. The location is absolutely perfect. You walk right outside and are staring at City Hall on Broad Street. If it wasnt so stinking cold it would have been an ideal location for walkability. Rooms were as expected for Aloft, and value was great as usual. We really enjoyed our stay and hope to return when it isnt so cold outside. Hi Micah, 5 STARS! Wow, thank you! Glad you enjoyed our hotel and of course the perfect location. The weather gods were a little off in their timing for your visit. We are looking at record highs this week, want to come back We've got some space available!Looking forward to your enjoying our backyard on the next visit. Sending warm thoughts...Evan
1	Great location, wonderful staff. We stayed at the River Hotel for 3 nights over New Years and very much enjoyed our stay. GREAT location for all of the New Years events put on by ChiTown Rising. The staff was wonderful and even got us a room with a better view at check-in. Pedro was great at the front desk!!! Rooms are smaller than what you would find in other hotels, but there is so much to do in Chicago we really only spent time in our room when we were sleeping. It is right on the BigBus tour line, so we found it really easy to get around town if we were headed somewhere further away than we wanted to walk.Thank you, Kelsey W, for choosing to stay at the River Hotel during your New Year celebration in Chicago. We agree with you - we have a prime location to enjoy all the attractions and festivities taking place in the city - year round!I am so pleased that Pedro and the hotel staff were able to be of service to you... I will make certain they see your kind words.Thanks again!
0	Worst of all La Quinta hotels that we have stayed in.. This was the dirtiest and least appealing of all La Quintas that we have stayed in. The main floor hallway carpets were dirty and actually starting to lift in places. The room had old and ripped furniture and looked worn out. A simple thing like a bed skirt looked stained and very old. This hotel needs a complete Reno from exterior to interior including the grounds around the hotel. The surrounding area looked unsafe and gave us a feeling never to walk around at night. There were no family restaurants in the area.Mal,I'm so sorry that your experience did not live up to expectations. We never want our guests feeling unsatisfied or unsafe. I will make sure and forward your comments on to the general manager to make sure that this remains an isolated incident.Sincerely,La Quinta Customer Care Team
1	Fun Weekend Getaway. Nice hotel with a very friendly staff. Enjoyed the happy hour every day. A great chance to grab a free drink and meet some of the other guests. Great central location in Gaslamp, very close to PetCo and tons of restaurants. Also has a rooftop bar which is nice. Walls seemed thin, could hear the same baby cry a few rooms down, but other than a little noise and limited room service, a nice place to stayHi John B,Thank you for the great review. We love mingling with our guests at our happy hour too! We really appreciate it and hope to see you back soon!
0	HORRIBLE PLACE. Checked in VERY LATE on a Friday night and we were assigned a smoking room with a king bed even though we did not request one. We were reassigned to a non-smoking room with two beds. Night clerk was very friendly and accommodating. Next day, we placed do not disturb sign on door as we had checked in really late. Approximately 11:00, we left room and went out to have lunch. Returned to room approximately 2:00 pm and discovered that room had not been cleaned. I called office and told them we needed our room cleaned and also informed the maid as she was in the room next door. The front desk clerk this time was very rude and told us that it was our fault since we had placed the sign on the door. When we returned to room at 10:00 pm, we found the room had not been touched. Night clerk said he could do nothing for s but did offer to bring us fresh towels. This hotel will NEVER get a single penny of my money again. The maids are inept and management is badly lacking.Thank you so much for taking the time to review our hotel, and thank you for your feedback. As the new manager of this property, I'm very interested in what our guests have to say. First, let me apologize for the confusion regarding the bed types service in the room you reserved. This is a training issues that I will definitely address with my front desk staff. We are working diligently to make improvements to our property, including retraining in every department. Our goal is a guest experience that creates loyalty.Please know that I am doing everything I can to make that a reality. And it's guests like you, that give honest and fair feedback, that make it possible. So thank you again, and we would love the opportunity to show you how we've improved. Hope to see you again soon!
1	Great remodel. The hotel has been thoroughly modernized and is great and very fresh. The size of the rooms and bathrooms in the main hotel is great. We did not stay in the of the rooms out by the pool. There was a slight issue when checking in as we called in the morning and requested connecting rooms as we had a 3 adults and 2 four year olds and a two and a half year old. When we checked in we were taken to the 9th floor first and no connection then to the 10th floor and no connection and then down to the 3rd floor and found connecting there. Kyle the bell hop was great and stayed with us on the radio so we did not have to travel up and down with cart and kids. They handled it well and resolved it quickly. Kyle did an excellent job of taking care of us. The only thing I would say is questionable is the pool area in the indoor area floor. The floor is very slippery and dangerous and we were quite surprised when we were there that the hotel has not done something to change that after all the money they spent on the remodel.Also had a bit of trouble everytime we left parking lot with room keys and the parking kiosk. Took several times and a buzz to the inside to get the gate up. We were not the only ones, everyone we came across was having trouble exiting the hotel parking lot. Maybe they should come up with a new system. Laundry area was nice and very clean and bright. They may want to considering adding one more of each machine as they have only one now, but it was a large room with plenty of space and very clean. The restaurant breakfast buffet was excellent and the staff in the restaurant and bar area were very good.The business center was great with new computers and a great printer. Would definitely stay again.
0	Beware - Listen to the reviews and stay away - Criminal!!!. There was one issue after the other. We noticed immediately upon entering our room that there was no toilet seat. Traveling with 3 females need toilet seat. Went to front desk to be told their were no other rooms available. A few hours later a toilet seat was brought to the room, at which time we discovered it didn't... More
0	No parking spot as a guest. I asked for my parking spot as a guest and they respond they were full and send me across the street to park my car to Komo plaza and pay 60 usd by my own for 2 nights. At least I was expected any courtesy or a refund of 60 usd from the hotel.Too bad.
1	Great Little Hotel, but......... The Bienville House has the perfect location for a visit to New Orleans, close to the action in the French Quarter, but not too close. Added to that is its incredibly friendly and helpful staff, including everyone from the person who helps you with parking your car, to the ladies at the front desk, to the maid who cleans your room. The balcony rooms are especially nice and look out onto a patio with saltwater pool and a view of the river in the distance. Overall decor is about what one would expect for a hotel that refers to itself as boutique. However, now to the but. The beds in the balcony rooms (where we stayed) are double, and soft to the point of sinking when one climbs in. They are most uncomfortable and should be replaced with queen-sized beds to match the wall-mounted headboards. The room coffee maker is about as minimal as can be found in any hotel, and the coffee and condiments provided are truly weak for a city that prides itself on its fine coffee. The daily ration of two packets of Twining tea was a nice touch! On leaving the elevator area, the halls to the rooms are stark, grey and unadorned. The word drab comes to mind. The biggest shortcoming we found at the hotel was the continental breakfast. Cold, stale bread, bagels and muffins do not constitute a continental breakfast, even with the added, but limited, selection of yogurt and cereal. We are certain that some of the same slices of bread appeared in the bread baskets on each of the four days we stayed, but hopefully we are mistaken. The person taking care of the buffet was very friendly and worked hard to take care of guests at breakfast. Unfortunately, she apparently didn't realize that the gloves she wore the entire time she was working were meant to be changed when performing different tasks. The same gloves stayed on no matter whether handling coffee cups, putting out food, clearing tables, or picking up items off the floor. An explanation regarding proper sanitary technique is in order. So, as said in the title, this could be a great little hotel, but it just needs some work.................Thank you for taking the time to comment regarding your recent visit to New Orleans and Bienville House. I regret that you did not receive the level of service we are capable of providing and I apologize. Your remarks are well taken and have been brought to the attention of our management team for review.We greatly value your patronage and do hope that you will reconsider and give us another opportunity to display to you the type of hospitality and service upon which our reputation is based and which you have every right to expect.
0	G daughters birthday weekend.. We (4) 2 adults 2 Teens. Arrived at 7am. Daughter is a silver member and had just stayed in Dubai and Frankfort literally days ago. She had requested dbl beds but be cause her room on her profile was king size, we ended up with a chair and a king size bed for 4 ppl. The next day we waited for someone to contact us and know on did.. We had to go to the desk and ask. They gave us a room w king bed and a pull out which would have been alright but we would have gotten exactly what was needed from another hotel in the area and cheaper if someone would have told us earlier in the day.After that they gave us one thin blanket for the pull out. Requested another and they were out. Finally got one . when the maid came to clean she took one of the blankets. We had to call down to correct that.. All in all it was a good trip but bad service... They need to communicate more with each other and there guess that are having problems to make there stay enjoyable and uncomplicated.Thank you for visiting the JW Marriott Atlanta for your special occasion. I am sorry we did not have the requested accommodations. I am also sorry that your blanket was slow to arrive and then once received, was removed by our housekeeping team. You can be certain I will personally speak with our housekeeping team to share your experience and to also ensure we are communicating with one another to ensure our guests are happy and comfortable. Please except my sincerest apology. I do hope you will give us the opportunity to regain your trust and confidence. Thank you again for letting me know.
1	Excellent staff and value. My family and I have stayed at this hotel three times now. Each time we are quite pleased. It is an exceptional value given how close it is to the beach and other San Diego amenities. The front desk staff is top notch, friendly, courteous and helpful. Special commendation to Jim Silver (GM), Alpha, Daniel and Oscar.Thank you for staying with us a number of times!! We are happy that you keep returning to stay with us. We never take it for granted that you will come back, so we try to keep our service up to a standard that hopefully anyone would want to stay. Thank you, again! We hope to see you soon!
0	Room not ready at check-in/billing error. Check-in at 3pm but room was not available until after 6pm. Was offered complimentary upgrade by staff to a slightly larger room and later charged the higher rate for this room. Although room was paid in cash, I was advised that a 50 hold is necessary for incidentals. I authorized this hold and was subsequently charged 3x totaling 150. Hotel... More
0	NEVER STAY HERE!!!. Worst experience ever! We were in ATL to attend the Alabama vs Virginia Tech game. Lots going on in Atlanta this weekend, the game, the Braves, Nascar, Dragacon, and more. We were excited to get a room downtown so last minute, when we made the reservation only 4 days earlier. We went to check in early and the rooms were not ready. OJ at front desk told us we could go ahead and park and check in after the game. We asked twice if we needed a parking pass and were told no. Parked below the motel and walked almost 2 miles to the Dome. Rather than have a huge towing bill and walk 2 miles we would have driven and paid 40 and parked near the Dome. Called after the game to make sure we were still good and let them know we would check in late to please not give up our room. We were assured everything was fine and we needed to check in my midnight, we got to the hotel with five minutes to spare. The night clerk proceeded to check up in and pulled out a parking pass. RED FLAG!!!! We told him we had asked for one early in the day and didn't receive one. My husband ran down to check and sure enough our truck had been towed. The clerk wanted us to check in our room and spend the night and deal with our missing truck the next day. NO WAY!!! All of our belongings were in our truck. When we finally found out where if had been towed we had to take a cab across town. Luckily we had a wonderful cab driver who helped us out a lot, stayed with us until he was sure we would get our truck back and warned us about quickly getting out of the area and not stopping because we were in a very bad part of town. The tow company wouldn't accept my debit or credit card, they needed my husbands. Thankfully I had some cash (which I rarely have). We finally got our truck and drove the very late 2 hour drive home. We found out that 10 vehicles were towed from this location that night. We feel very strongly that this was a scam between the desk clerk and the tow company. The man at the impound lot told us he had never know of them taking cars from this location until yesterday when they got 10 from there. Don't be the next victim.
1	Better than the average chain hotel. If you're used to the average chain hotel where you get a reasonably sized room and a simple breakfast at a good price, you'll like this place.We chose this location because we were just arriving on an evening flight on our way to Sedona. The hotel is convenient to the highway but there's really nothing else around the property.The property is modern and fairly clean. The room was nicely made up and had some useful amenities like a fridge, microwave, and sink. The TV and wifi worked well. Unfortunately, the free popcorn ends up on the floors in the elevator and and the carpet in the hallways which looks messy. Otherwise, everything was well maintained.The staff was friendly and the breakfast filled us up well enough.I would definitely use this chain again as long as the rates were comparable to similar hotels in the area.
1	Not bad, clean. The Fairfield Inn Suites Key West at The Keys Collection in Key West, was a clean hotel, a little out of Key West. There was a shuttle into Key West proper, but it was crowded do to other hotels in the same area give the shuttle free as a perk, at the Fairfield Inn it was 20/ day/ room. We did some things on the side of the island that the Inn on. Key West Botanical Garden, and Lazy Dog Kayak and Paddle Boards which were both great. Overall a good stay, Marriott has to update their breakfasts, have stayed in many Marriott properties, the breakfast is always the same.Dear Thomas M,Thank you for taking the time to Review our Hotel. We are very Happy that you had a Nice Stay. We hope to see you back in Key West very soon for another Nice stay.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager
0	disgusting room would not recommend at all. I didn't stay. I checked in for about an hour and was totally disgusted from what I saw and smelled..Room was dirty, the sliding glass door was broken and it had no screen to cover the door if u opened it. Furniture was broken, the refrigerator was dirty, the curtains had cigarette burns and dirt marks all over them. I would not recommend this hotel at all.
0	Old and Tired. Old tired hotel. My room was right on the edge of a 10 lane highway and I had to sleep with ear plugs. Although clean, the room was old with cracks in the walls, saggy beds and grey towels. One evening we had no water at all for about an hour. One morning we had no hot water. Staff were pleasant and did their best but they don't have much to work with. Wifi so slow it was useless and I was forced to link to my cell phone.
0	Not as expected. The room has additional room fee charged which should be included in the price for wifi ect and the wifi consitantly drops out. The noise at night from other venues such as empty bottles being emptied into bins occurs every night and the room above had water dripping onto our window from the a/c unit which kept us awake. It's a old hotel with a lick of paint on it and also had construction work being carried out during the day the staff are friendly but I won't be returning.Thank you for the feedback. We are pleased to hear that you found our staff to be friendly. I apologize however if the rest of your stay was less than excellent. We do charge a facility fee that includes free Wifi as well as other items. I am sorry you were having difficulties connecting, we do have 24 hour staff available at the front desk to assist our guests with things like this. We strive for all guests to have a 5 star stay and again we apologize this was not the case.
0	Not that great. The lobby was very nice, but that was about it. the room was not at all what you would expect from the description. I had to deodorize the room due to a strange odor, it wasn't horrible but unpleasant. The bed was not comfortable, but was semi-clean other than a well worn sheet. The AC did work very well and the the TV was a recent upgrade, too bad the hotel only had 5 channels to choose from. Overall, I was disappointed with the room and I am thankful I only stayed a single night. I would not stay there again and probably would not stay in a hotel in the surrounding area either.
1	Glad We Stayed at Cooper's Mill. We were in Cedar Rapids for an event at the convention center, and I originally had made a reservation at the adjoining Double Tree. However, my wife searched on Hotels.com and instead booked a room at the Best Western Cooper's Mill Hotel in order to save almost 100. It was a good choice. The Best Western is located just off I-380 and was only a short jaunt (.5 miles) to the convention center. While there was a bit of a funky smell in the first floor hallway, our room on the second floor was large and clean (my wife in particular noted how immaculately clean the bathroom was). We had a microwave and refrigerator in our room, and we also used the free WiFi. The indoor swimming pool was also on the 2nd floor, although we did not have time to take a dip on this trip. There is a bar and restaurant that adjoins the hotel, and we took advantage of their 1.25 frosty mug special (daily until 6 pm). As the event that brought us to town kept us up quite a bit later than our usual bedtime, we were glad for the noon check-out time. We would definitely stay again at the Best Western Cooper's Mill Hotel the next time we overnight in Cedar Rapids.
0	dirty. Clean the bathrooms. Noisy! After driving 10 hours, you wa, nna unwind call it a night. Don't do it there! Small plastic tiolet seat. Tub to dirty to put your feet in! I travel a lot. Stayed in quality inns. Just never this one again!
1	Wonderful location!. I great place to stay just off Duval street. The registration staff was VERRY helpful with great suggestions. A very eclectic small hotel. A small bar area was very comfortable. Others have commented on the great bartender...that was not our experience. He seemed to be completely focused on his Brit and Aussie patrons to the exclusion of the rest of us. I would return here for the accommodations and pool area Thank your for sharing your feedback regarding your stay with us.Glad that you enjoyed our location and our facilities.However, we are sincerely sorry to hear that you had a less-than-perfect experience at our bar. And I am 100 sure that if you give them a second chance, our staff will know how to make it right to you. Our bar is one of our major asset within our establishment. Their attention to details and their natural sympathy made them become a reference in the island.We hope he will have the chance to fully meet your expectations during your next venue at the Saint.
1	Very good hotel, great location. This hotel is a little gem. It is situated right next to Union square - literally a 50m walk at most! This is it's biggest selling point!Union square in all reality, is the best place to stay in San Francisco. Being close to Powell St as well, you are very close to a couple of cable car stops as well (essential for getting to Fishermans Wharf and great fun to ride).There is a Walgreens just around the corner (supermarket) which is also handy. As you walk out the doors of the hotel, to your right are 2 little sandwich / delis (both before you get to the street corner). Both are fantastic for breakfast, lunch or a meal. Highly recommend them. Well priced and very tasty food. They are small places, but are great. Sears is also just around the corner on Powell St which is an institution in SFran. We were told the breakfast was great, but only ended up going to dinner there. Quite a decent more home cooked American style meal that won't break the bank.The hotel itself is quaint. It is an old style hotel but still looks in good condition. The check in staff are very friendly and the concierge (Ron) is brilliant! The hotel has an ATM in the foyer - was not expecting this for a boutique hotel. There are also major bank ATMs just around the corner on Powell as well.There are no in-room safes (bit of a negative as the closets are big enough to have one) - so on check in make sure you ask for a check in desk safe as they can run out. Also, no small fridge (seriously, all hotels should have one for the convenience of their customers and not have to pay extra for it - in Australia and Asia, I have yet been to a hotel that does not have one!).Wifi is free - which is great! We found in too many hotels in US that we had to pay for Wifi (The room is compact but not like the tiny European hotel rooms. For a week stay, it was comfortable. The bed was good. The bathroom - needs renovation. It does not have to be massive, but the taps and shower heads need to be replaced - as they are getting old.The restaurant next door (the Farallon) - don't bother. It is overpriced and the service is (well at least what we experienced), very poor.If I were to come to San Francisco again, I would definitely stay here. Location is perfect and the hotel is very good and not expensive.
1	pretty good. Todd the front desk was very professional. Rebecca spoiled the clients like a mother hen. These two employees are really asset to that place where they work. I will definitely, recommend that Best Western Orlando East inn suites. Overall everyone was very nice. The only thing that was lacked over there was an excercise room.We at Best Western wanted to extend our thanks for providing feedback regarding your recent stay! We are happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay, and that Rebecca and Todd were able to enhance your stay with us. We will be sure to commemorate these two great employees for going above and beyond for you. We do apologize for not having an exercise room, but that is something we are trying implement either into our location, or with local gyms. However, we do greatly value you as a guest, and hope to continue to keep Best Western in mind the next time you need a place to stay.

1	Great stay. Nice place to stay at would stay here again. Service was very good. Staff was very friendly . Close to airport and they will take you and bring back to. It was very great stay and would recommend anyone to stay.Thank you so much for telling us about your recent experience at our hotel. We are so glad that you had a pleasant stay. We strive everyday to exceed our guest expectations. We look forward to serving you and your family in the future!Thank you for making it the Hampton Inn By Hilton Philadelphia Airport!Adrian Woods, Director of Sales
0	Holiday Inn North Phoenix. A disorderly mess from the start. When we checked in and got up to our room it wasn't clean and the beds were not made. On the second day of our stay we returned to our room at 4:00 to find the room has not been cleaned but our towels had been removed and items had been moved in our room. When we inquired, the manager stated no one has been in our room insisting we had been the only ones to enter. At no point was he apologetic or reasonable in regards to our concerns. At this point I decided to check out. I made the error of prepaying through Expedia and now the hotel is avoiding their attempts to refund the nights I did not stay. A terrible experience all around in a poorly managed hotel.
1	An unforgetable experience to spend Thanksgiving 2016 in an one of a kind luxury world class place!. Our son made the arrangement for us to stay here for one night after a short staying in another SPG hotel. We were not too sure whether it would be worth the move for an one night stay! My husband was just recently out of the hospital, and still uses a walker. We thought of the problems with the holiday traffic on the Fifth Ave, getting in and out of the car, and walk up the steps/stairs.....In stead of walking up the steps, we used the elevator located inside the King Cole Bar and Salon next door. Once we stepped into the lobby of St. Rigis, our worries went off the chimney! There seemed to be a special flowery cent in the air as you walked on the shiniest marble designed floors of the hotel. We sat comfortably awaiting for the checking-in. Due to the upgrade to a room with two doubles, we had to wait for a while which was perfectly fine. After a short wait, we were thoughtfully offered to wait in another room to rest until our room was ready. The idea that the management would do that for us has won us over!St. Regis is an one of a kind classy hotel with the old world class charm and beauty. Once inside the room, we were impressed with the modern update using the computer technology, among them: the TV screen fit right into the bathroom mirror would earn a wow factor the 4 types of lightening controls located both near the bed and the entrance of the room was a plus in convenience and lacquer-like Chinese cabinet under the TV to hind the refrigerator and bar was a combo of beauty and convenience. The huge multi-plated mirrors which occupied the entire wall, and the crystals hanging on the chandelier were practically spotless, so were the intricate moldings around the ceiling and the chandelier. The decoration of the room has a luxury feel yet they are just as practical and comfortable as solid every day furniture. The shower which is a separate unit has great water pressure. The tub equipped with the hang-over rack was a perfect way for a relax soak after long walks at the Macy's parade. The marble/stone bath room is spacious and modern which again is a pleasant surprise found in an old hotel. Among those who came to stay and walked those hallways beyond the glass entrance doors on each floor were Eva Gardiner and Salvador Dali, so we were told when first were lead into our room. I must say that we felt just as welcome as any entertainers and/or artists when we were greeted by the staff. As we walked out of the room, as we got in or out of the car, we were greeted politely and warmly. People who stay here for a day or a week are lucky to enjoy the world class luxury, and those who are associated with this first rate elegant hotel appear to be happy and proud to be part of this perfect corporation.Dear goplace42, We are humbled by your complimentary review of your recent stay at our hotel. Thank you for allowing us to provide you with superior and thoughtful service and most importantly, we thank you for making us your new favorite hotel.Sincerely, Octavia Marginean
0	Stay Away!. Absolutely rude front desk clerk. We arrived at 5pm and this lady clerk was condescending and positively RUDE.............So rude we cancelled our stay at this place to stay at the Best Western. Stear clear.
1	Definite 3 star property but it's on the beach. You can't beat this hotel because it is right on the beach. It is mid beach so away from the hectic and trashy south beach vibe. If you want to escape the incessant pounding music and Kardashian wannabes of the SOuth Beach hotels and neighboring Eden Roc of Fountainbleau then this is a great option. But also don't expect the service of any of these adjacent properties. THe service here is minimal at best. You wait forever at breakfast if you order off the menu. The doormen are non existent as is a concierge. THere is no room service and the food is mediocre. Terrible service out by the pool with a limited menu. No beach chairs - you have to pay an outside vendor. The bathroom was so tiny we could open the door less than halfway because it hit the toilet. Two people trying to use it was like a circus maneuver. It can't possibly be code. There are plastic cups for drinking - no glass but the bed was comfy and the flat screen TV was great. THe staff is not that helpful and the balcony's seem old and in need of paint. We had a gorgeous view but the balconies are interconnected with a rail between them. Our neighbor chain smoked on his balcony which made sitting out extremely unpleasant. That said if you get a good price is really worth it because it is on the beach and that is why I went to Miami Beach in the first place.
1	Roomy rooms, great amenities. This is a long-term stay hotel, so our room came with a kitchenette and small living room with a sofa and coffee table. We only stayed there for three nights, so didn't make use of the extra space, but it was nice to have room to move around. The reception desk was helpful and friendly. Breakfast was great, but skip the omelet bar. The line was too long, and it took forever. There were plenty of other options available (cereal, fruit, pastries, potatoes, eggs, oatmeal...). The complimentary shuttle was great for sightseeing. We took it to Pike Place and downtown saved on taxis and uber. Housekeeping could be more attentive, but since our stay was brief and we're not slobs, it was fine. Can't beat the location - literally across the street from the Space Needle and Chihuly.mistybunny,Thank you for staying with us next to the Space Needle! We love our incredible location and are ecstatic that you felt the same way. As one of the newest members to the Hyatt family, we are more than appreciative of your feedback and am glad to see you enjoyed your stay. We pride ourselves on our guest satisfaction and hope to see you again soon in the near future.Sarah Junge
0	Don't be fooled. The best part of the stay at Metro Points besides check out was the staff. I commend them for working in such deplorable conditions. I was extremely disappointed. From the outside, peering through the window, the hotel is beautiful. When I entered I was met by stained carpet and dirty walls. Although check in was easy (Kudos to Mr. Davis) who worked hard to accommodate me. However, he could not fix the peeling paint, the spotty drapes, the snowy picture, the no wifi the entire time I was there, the sink with no running water and the tub with no knobs. This hotel has the potential to be very good. Management cannot be oblivious to all the defects. Management needs to get it together. It's the little things that keep customers or drive them away. I drove away with no intention of ever returning.
0	Worst hotel that I have ever stayed at.. This hotel is horrible. Do not waste your money, you will be disappointed. It is dirty, the staff is horrible and is nowhere to be found at night. The front desk even closes early. There was a fight outside of my room which went on for 45 minutes. No one ever came to see what was going on. I called the front desk but there was no one there to answer the call. Nightmare of a hotel.
0	DO NOT STAY HERE. Not fit for human occupancy. No internet, even though they advertise 2 connections. Bagels, mini muffins, apples, and OJ for breakfast They ask you to place used plastic knives in a receptacle so they can be used again!! I was on the top floor, and the room (especially the bed) shook every time a truck or bus passed by. Employees watch TV in the lounge all the time, and have BAD attitudes. The place smelled! I used up a can of air freshener in 2-3 days! Pool only had about 18 of green rain water in it. A horror show.
1	Great property, wonderful beds, extremely clean staff was very welcoming. Location was convenient to everything. Great property! Wonderful beds! Upgraded furnishings in room 309. Good location to everything. Very quiet. Staff was friendy welcoming. I booked this hotel via the 800 and the gentlemen was super friendly and helpful. Rate was 107/night, which for Napa Christmas week was a very good value. If you sign up for the Best Rewards program you get coupons for breakfast at Denny's which was on property. Even it had an upscale feeling to it. No complaints whatsoever about this hotel experience!Thank you for your review of our property. I am glad you had a great time.
1	Great location right next to beach, would stay here again in a heartbeat.. The location of this hotel is great. The view from our room was wonderful. The staff at this place is great. Patrick was a great resource and helped with directions, recommendations for eateries, and where to find cheap bike rentals. I would definately stay here again. The continental breakfast was more than I expected with waffles, pastries and a fresh assortment of fruit and cereal. I would recommend this place to anyone traveling to San Diego that wants a beach front hotel. I would say that the only downfall was the small underground parking spots. It was a tight squeeze even for a compact vehicle. Other than that i would say an exceptional hotel.Glad to hear you had a good time during your stay and enjoyed the amenities.Thank you for giving OPI such an great review.Thanks for spending time at Ocean Park Inn.
0	Stay someplace else. Was in town for a basketball tournament, and stayed here. Big mistake. The rooms smelled like rotten food or something. There were wires sticking out of the heater as if somebody was working on it. The rooms were very dated and the beds were not comfortable. Would be better off at a motel 6 for the money. On my second... More
0	How many ways can a hotel be bad. I'm writing this as I prepare to check out, this way the recollections are fresh.I just got back to the computer after the door opened. Fortunately I used the chain lock. Not do be negative, there were a few good things. The parking lot has a high fence, which is good since the neighborhood made me nervous. No stores nearby, a good drive willl get you to places with vagrants and loiterers outside, lexan cages to protect the cashiers.The clerk wanted to be helpful, but there was only one of her. I waited in line each of the 3 times it took to lug my bags up and down from the 5th floor because the key cards did not work. The next day when I got back from a gruelling 12 hour work day, the keys did not work again, 2 more times up and down with heavy gear. The fridge worked and was properly adjusted. Beds were comfortable.Close to Turner Field and the Georgia dome and the airport.That's it for the good. The room was dirty, not cleaned surfaces with dried spills, hair in my ice bucket. One of the 2 old, noisy, shuddering elevators gave up the ghost and trapped a guest. The Internet worked but was very slow. I would have my toenails pulled before I book here again.Scott M,Thank you for taking the time to leave a review of our hotel and your experiences during your stay. Since your stay we have made many improvements and continue the effort to continuously elevate our level of service. I hope you will stay with us again and experience the positive changes we have made during your next visit to Atlanta. We have fully renovated our property and all our guest rooms, which I hope you will be able to experience when you next stay in Atlanta. Again, thank you for your comments, all feedback is used to help improve our efforts to build our hotel staff and product into a destination guests look forward to visiting.Sincerely,Enoch D.
0	Misleading rating. I traveled for business and this hotel rated at 3 stars with corporate booking too. I had to store my suitcase on my bed the rooms are so tiny. The elevator is barely functional so be prepared to hall your suitcase. The fitness center has one out dated treadmill and a few weights and equipment that doesn't work. Good Nob Hill location but better off staying in Union Square for better value.
0	The rumors are true. I am so glad they canceled our reservation after seeing all the terrible reviews. We had a reservation to stay here as we were traveling from San Fran. We called to double check our reservation thank god. We let them know we would be arriving about 10 pm and were double checking that that would be ok. NOPE!! They canceled... More
1	good value motel. We stayed for 5 nights with our 2 children, we arrived from australia at 10am and were very grateful to get an early checkin, the motel is a long walk from disneyland and the easiest way to get there is by the art bus which comes every 20 minutes. Our room was clean and services everyday and the kids loved the pool, we did find the room was very hot though and the air conditioning was too noisy to use over night. If we were returning to Anaheim we would chose a hotel directly across from disneyland to make it easier to return to the room during the day.Thank you for your stay with us at the Best Western Pavilions. We are pleased you enjoyed our hotel and look forward to seeing you again on your next trip to the Anaheim area. Thank you again.
1	Stay in Dallas. Had everything you need for a pleasant stay. Kitchen for a extended stay if needed. Wifi and included breakfast made it a great value! Dear Tim956,Thank you for your kind words regarding your stay at the Hawthorn Suites Dallas Park Central. We were glad to have you as our guest, and appreciate you taking the time to comment regarding your visit with us. We look forward to the opportunity to host you again the next time you are in the Dallas area. Thanks again for being our guest! Best regards, Charlie Westhoven Operations Manager Hawthorn Suites Dallas Park Central
0	Wouldn't stay here for free. I stayed there for a week on a business trip. I wasn't looking for anything special, but The hotel seemed rundown. I didn't realize that that the corridors were external, which isn't a huge problem, but they were painting them while I was there making it inconvient to get around. The room and bathroom were shabby as well. What really did it for me though was when I packing to check out on the last day I found a small broken piece of glass tube under the bed. Curiousity got the best of me so I took it the training class I was finishing up and asked a police officer in the same class what looked like to him. He said that it was a piece of crack or meth pipe.
1	The Maritime Hotel: Great hotel choice for Chelsea. I stayed at The Maritime Hotel on May 21-22, 2016. It is a stylishly appointed space throughout, from the lobby to the restaurant to the rooms. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful both check in and check out were a breeze. They'll hold your bags for you if your room isn't ready at the time you check in and they'll hold them for you even after you check out if your check out time is earlier than when you're finally ready to leave Chelsea. Incredibly convenient location to lots of restaurants and activities, including the Highline. The hotel is also right across the street from The Chelsea Market, which is terrific shopping experience. I highly recommend booking The Maritime if you plan to stay in the Chelsea neighborhood. The only caveat I have is bring earplugs for sleeping, or some kind of white noise generator to drown out the sound of car horns honking all night. Other than that, it was a great stay.
0	Contact High. People staying here must think no smoking only applies to cigarettes. Smoke rolls out of the rooms like a scene from an old Cheech and Chong movie. Property is not that old but has not been well maintained. Worst part is the staff - they are clearly very unhappy.
1	Nice Clean, Very Hospitible, Private Gated Parking and Trolley Stops Right In Front. We felt this hotel was perfect for taking the trolley to every location. Clean, Comfortable Bed, Air Conditioning worked great, breakfast was a hot Continental breakfast but you could grab juices and water out of the fridge in the lobby without charge and they always had fresh baked cookies. We were wanting to stay near the French Quarter but they were booked up and we were so glad we ended up staying in the Garden District. It was a nicer area and only took a short ride by trolley to get to the French Quarter and down to the Casino. We had secure parking. When we first checked in, we had a problem with our remote and the maintenance man came immediately and fixed the issue immediately. We had great recommendations from the front dest clerk. Just a very pleasant stay on a 2 month trip we were on.Maggie, thank you for taking the time to review your stay! I'm glad we were a fun spot on your two month trip! Even though we are not located in the French Quarter, we are so close that you can still easily get there and enjoy all it has to offer. Then after you explore there, you can come back and enjoy our quieter neighborhood! I hope you had a great road trip! We will see you the next time you visit New Orleans!Kathleen Davis, Front Office Manager
1	Gir's weekend. Stayed overnight on 4/23/16 with my sister at the hotel and was very pleasantly surprised! The hotel's location was great and the interiors were very stylish. My sister and I stayed in a room with a wonderful view of Trump Tower, Marina City, the Chicago's river and bridges. The room itself, although small, was clean and nicely decorated. Our room had twin beds that were firm but comfortable to sleep on. The hotel was perfect for our needs! We wanted a place to stay near the loop where we could make the most of our weekend downtown. Also, the staff was friendly and the customer service manager that assisted us, Pedro, was very helpful. We plan on coming again in the fall for another weekend downtown and will be staying there again.Dear 216jvs,Thank you for your detailed review of the River Hotel. I am so glad you found the room and staff services to your liking and you were able to enjoy your weekend from our ideal location in the heart of the city. Pedro is a great asset to our operation and I will make sure he sees your kind words.We look forward to welcoming you back in the fall!
1	Stay for the day. So, it was 7:30a, we just debarked our cruise and our flight didn't leave until 11p. We are a family of four: two adults/two kids, so naturally I wanted to be somewhere where my husband and I could relax and the kids could splash around in the pool ..or something.We called around to other hotels and were given ridiculous day rates. We happened upon the Sheraton and gave them a call. They were incredibly accommodating and the price for the room was unbelievably reasonable. Check in was smooth, the hotel was very clean and the room was spacious and delightful. The heated pool actually felt heated and the hot tub was relaxing. If you have a day in Orlando and you just want to relax..Stay Here!!!We were thrilled to hear that we were able to accommodate your needs and that you enjoyed your day at the Sheraton Suites Orlando Airport! We strive in making every guests stay a memorable one and were happy to hear of your experience. We would love to see you and your family again soon!
0	Wouldn't Stay Here Again. This place wasn't as bad as some made it out to be but I won't be seeking it out for my next stay in AC and definitely would never stay here for full price. The comment made that it's a motel attached to a nice hotel about sums it up but I'll elaborate.The hallways are pretty dingy, carpets ripped in places and neon lights on each floor which I think are meant to embrace the kitschy but just wind up just casting a glow that exacerbates the horror-movie feel of the rundown place.The room itself wasn't too bad. Small, but suited our purposes. I actually think the carpet and paint were fairly new. A really old beat up dresser but a nice flat screen atop of it and the bed and pillows were very comfortable and clean. There was also a balcony which would have been a nice touch but it was flooded with dirty water while we were there. No getting around it. The bathroom was old. Broken ugly tile, some weird yellow glaze over half the floor tiles, rust on the vanity and in the tub. But there were adequate towels, everything worked, and it seemed like everything was clean which is the more important part. The water pressure was pretty okay though the water temperature did not get very hot. Somebody else complained of their room smelling like pot and we had the same experience, I think it was coming through the bathroom vent.The part that will keep me from coming back were the thin walls. Despite the comfy beds, I got basically no sleep. It was Friday night in AC, people want to have a good time, and I can't really fault the hotel for their guests so I forgive the women who decided to belt out showtunes at 3AM directly outside our door. They were pretty good, but I'm just not a theater person. The thing that drove me craziest was the elevator. After one trip on it my husband and I opted for the stairs, but some brave souls were taking it all hours of the night and every single time they landed on our floor, I woke up. PING! Somebody commented that the elevator bell was loud and I thought they were being nit-picky but it turns out this is the loudest elevator bell I've ever heard in my life. We weren't even directly across from it and it was loud enough to act as an alarm clock every time on our floor-mates came back from the casino. We had a late check-out but couldn't leave early enough to get home and get some sleep. I would say if you're taking a trip where you know you'll be out all night and won't be getting any sleep anyway, AND you can get a deal, this isn't the worst place you could drop off your stuff.
0	Ok.... Hotel was fine, big room, great view...but having to pay for WiFi, after paying so much for a room, as well as free WiFi for non-residents in the lobby? Over priced restaurant and bar, the top view is only for VIP guests, loads of people attending a conference over everywhere.....wouldn't stay here again. Disappointed after paying so much money then being asked to pay more for the basics...especially with the more attractive alternatives nearby.
1	Nice hotel before our cruise. We were only staying in NOLA for one night before our cruise and stayed at this hotel. It was very nice and secure. Your room key was also a means to get into the hotel after a certain point at night and to also use the elevator. (We've never experienced security quite like that before ).. the hotel is in a very nice part of NOLA, however...it's about 4 blocks from the French Quarter so it is quiet. I would definitely consider staying here again and I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a quiet hotel that's not too far from all of the action.
1	Luxury close the Convention Center.. This hotel is a beautiful property. My room was spacious, modern and luxurious. The staff was friendly and I felt at home. This hotel is right next to the Convention Center. There is a Starbucks connected to the hotel. The fitness center included machines, free weights, a hot tub area, steam room and sauna. Thank you for taking the time to share feedback on your stay at the Grand Hyatt Seattle. We are delighted to hear you enjoyed your room and that it felt like home. Our goal is to make sure you feel welcomed and comfortable. It is nice and convenient to be so close to the Convention Center especially since no umbrella is needed as the walk is fully covered. Hopefully, you had some sun during your stay! We are very proud of our fitness center and are delighted that you were able to make use of it.I will pass along the compliments to our staff as we want to make every guest feel at home in our hotel.We look forward to welcoming you back on your next trip to Seattle!
0	Rude staff. The lobby was nice, but the room was small and the bathroom was dirty. The room didn't have a small refrigerator which I was shocked to find. So much for my leftovers. The woman when we checked in and out was standoffish. Good things about the hotel: the bed was comfortable and the location was nice. After arriving home I discovered a charge on my card from the hotel. I didn't do anything to incur a charge so I called them to ask about it. The woman on the phone was unbelievably rude! She transferred me to a voicemail where one of my options was to press zero for personal assistance (which is why I called). I was rerouted to the same woman who now seemed incredibly frustrated by me and insisted I leave a voicemail. She transfers me again. I just thought she could have been more polite and accommodating. I did get the issue sorted out, but the attitude of the woman on my initial phone call left a bad taste in my mouth. The location of this hotel is great, but the hotel itself isn't nice enough for the rate and the staff could use a lesson in manners and service.
1	Cella Consulting Business Trip. Slightly apprehensive at first, but once I walked through the doors, this hotel is the gem of the area. I love the rooms and the fact that one can absolutely relax without flipping on the tube or picking up the phone - you find them. The boutique bar - restaurant is awesome and I highly recommend a bourbon on the rocks with some BurattaHello richardmO9670EC, Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to review your stay. I am so glad to hear that you loved your visit and that you found the Broken Shaker to be so amazing. I hope we can see you back again very soon!
1	Airport shuttle 24 hours.. Close location to Orlando airport. Shopping area next door within walking distance as well as a Denny's restaurant. Clean with friendly staff. Breakfast not included when booked on Expedia points. Our room was also right by the cleaning staffs supplies. Good thing it was an early flight and we didn't have to sleep in. Nice out door sitting area with fire feature, nice on the cooler days.We appreciate your great remarks about your recent stay at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport. Its pleasing to know that our location and complimentary shuttle service was convenient for your needs. We are also glad you enjoyed your well-stocked room and the exceptional service from our associates. It was our pleasure to have you as our guest, and we hope to serve you and your family again when in Orlando!Sincerely,Michael GoldwasserGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport
1	Cool vibe at this sweet hotel. This hotel is so cool and hip. The rooms are very stylish....you even get a pet in the room (a fish). They show movies outside by the pool on the wall. The restaurant is amazing - the food is so fresh and organic. Very cool hip place. Stay or just go for dinner or drinks.....this place will not disappoint!!On behalf of the entire Pearl Hotel crew and family. Thanks for the great review. We appreciate it. Your support and kind words go a long way. Will be sharing with our staff. Hope you will come stay again in the near future. Tell a friend.
1	vacation. bed were firm but location and price couldn't be any better. The breakfast was great. This is a family orientated hotel. Very noisey due to all the small children having a great time. If you know this when you make your reservation then you will be fine. The noise level definitely went down by 11pm.Good Afternoon,I appreciate you taking time to review your stay with us here through Tripadvisor. I'm happy to know you had a wonderful stay and were happy with our rooms, location and breakfast. Although it can be a little loud at times we do our best to keep it quiet.Should you visit San Diego area again you're more than welcome to contact me directly for your reservation needs. You can reach me at 619-275-5700 ext 393 or Lpradohotel pros.bizOnce again thank you for your review!Leidy PradoFront Office Manager
1	Great hotel!!!. Stayed at the Holiday Inn Bayside June 16-19 for a long needed vacation with the hubby. The location was great!!! Many restaurants nearby, and the hotel has an onsite restaurant and bar, both of which were excellent!! We stayed in the two room suite, and it was spacious and very clean. Hotel has a great sized pool, hot tub and a pool table and a mini golf course. Plenty to do when not sight seeing!! Only issue was that there was no parking spaces open the second night of our stay, since we didn't get back until after 7pm. We were told by the front desk that we could park in the pay parking lot next door to the hotel, and we would be reimbursed. Considering most hotels charge for parking and the Bayside has free parking, it wasn't so bad (6) and we were reimbursed. All in all a great place to stay.Thank you for taking the time to leave a review on our hotel. We are so pleased that you really enjoyed your stay and all of our amenities. We hope you'll be back again soon to enjoy our great city!Sincerely,Charleene Poissot, Director of Sales Marketing
0	Make sure you ask of the room has a WINDOW. This hotel taught me something very important. Always make sure the hotel room you are getting, has a window. Lugging your luggage all around through the stairs on the multiple floors ensures this is NOT a good hotel for those who need accommodation. It's right in the middle of things, but again--no window. There is a central pool that is pretty busy, and a 24 hour ice and vending machine area. But again NO WINDOW. They don't advertise this, and won't tell you when you check in. It's a nasty little surprise if you're not careful.Hi James, thank you for choosing the French Market Inn and taking the time to share your feedback. Our hotel has four types of accommodations - interior (windowless, but our best value), petite, deluxe, and balcony. These room types and their features are clearly indicated on our hotel's website, booking engine, and on our other online listings. Our historic property has a mixture of buildings, some of which have elevators. We suggest those who require elevator access make this request directly with our reservations department prior to check-in to ensure availability. We appreciate your kind comments about our location, and hope you enjoyed your time in New Orleans.
0	lots of renovations. the lobby must be the first place they renovated and it looks great but I stayed on 6 floor and everything in it was old and smelled weird, elevator squeaked all the way up not a great feeling, beds were comfy but I prefer queens
1	GREAT STAFF! BUT THATS NOT THE ROOM I BOOKED.. The hotel did not have to room I reserved. So I was bribed with free breakfast and free parking. Although it was a nice jester it still doesn't make up for me being placed in a room that did not accommodate my party. I booked 30 days in advance yet these people saw it fit to check other people into those rooms knowing that they had other guests arriving that booked the same room. A guest behind me was told the same thing. The staff was incredibly nice and graceful buy, I guess you have to when greedy corporations overbook hotels and leave them to deal with the customers.
0	OK, if you need a place to stay. The TV and Internet were fine, as were the bed and a/c - important items. But otherwise, this was a tired, ill-kept place. From a chirping fire detector to a running toilet to plastic flowers and minimal breakfast. But it was the cheapest alternative around.
1	Awesome Boutique hotel in a great location. Hotel solamar: this is one of the better hotels I've had the pleasure of staying at. Downtown, city glam combined with small boutique charm equated to a delightful stay. From the red bikes you can borrow, the Eco friendly practices, the chic styling, the delightful staff, to the amazing location, the hotel solamar is hard to beat if staying in downtown SD.Location: 5 (perfect for downtown stays, embarcadero, Petco park with bountiful food/shopping choices)Service: 5Price: 4.5 ( .5 point subtraction for high valet overnight charges)Restaurant: 4.5 (half a point subtraction for price, awesome that they are local, organic, and highly sustainable)Pool: 4 (small, but clean rooftop pool)Bar: 4.5 (location and view, but minus half a point for value)Room: 4.5 (chic clean rooms, but slightly cookie cutter. Good size bathroom and living spaces. Amazing view of Petco park and gaslamp)Hello RobChills, Awesome survey! Thank you so much. Were happy you enjoyed so many of our awesome amenities and location. Come back and see us again soon!Justin Assistant General Manager
0	Bad side of town. This hotel had a dirty pillow (blood stains) the shower was clogged the breakfast was horrible and the staff seemed unprofessional.
1	Historic Gem Hotel in Business District of New Orleans. Stay at The Whitney to capture a sense of the history of New Orleans with its actual bank vault door decor, and location that is right in the heart of New Orleans great for business but close to the French Quarter for fun. It's clean, comfortable, has amenities, and is a great location, friendly too.Thank you for your recent stay at the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans! We're glad to hear you enjoyed your visit and look forward to hosting you again soon. Please don't hesitate to contact us directly for your next New Orleans get-a-way!Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
0	Disgusted. It had roaches... Roaches.
0	Never again. Lobby was nice, and coffee was good. Had to carry luggage up and down stairs to get to luggage cart. There was no ramp for the luggage cart to get to car. Desk clerk was argumentative at check in. Refrigerator was in closet so very little room to hang clothes (about 8 inches). Shower curtain wouldn't stay closed. At breakfast, yogurt and hard boiled eggs were frozen. Didn't feel safe and switched to another hotel after one night. Desk clerk at check out was rude. Manager would not leave office to speak with me about concerns.
0	Unexpected disappointment.. BW has an annex! It's on the far side of the street. We had a roach and a broken air conditioner the first day. Had to repack and move to another room! On the third day in 103 degrees the elevator broke. We're 75 and our new room was on the third floor! All outside surfaces are covered w tar rather than repaving. It's pealing and looks very shabby. Only four umbrellas at the outdoor pool for over 100 guests! We had stayed in the main bldg. before, and were very disappointed to be across the street.
0	Sent me to occupied room with man in bed.. On October 11, 2011, after checking in at the front desk I was sent to a room that was occupied, and as I entered the man in the bed quickly covered himself. Humiliation! I went back down to the front desk, and the lady looked up the room I had been sent to and said oh, it does look like someone is in that room! Really So she quickly sent me to another room, but forgot to change my key card, so I had to return to the desk again. I had a terrible couple of nights sleep because outside my window the garbage trucks were dumping dumpsters of garbage from the entire building across the street. All night long.The only consolation was that I was given a small reduction on one nights stay, but had to remind them of the humiliation I had upon check-in to get that. I will never stay here again.
1	Setting the Standard. Shout out to the fantastic concierge staff. Luxury and class is the norm. Enjoy the complimentary Arnold Palmer in the afternoon by the guest elevators. And take a ride in the Bentley. This is my chosen NY hotel. It is central to practically everything.Dear Milner Family, On behalf of the concierge team at The St. Regis New York, we would like to thank you for completing your review on TripAdvisor. We are so pleased to hear how much you enjoyed your stay with us, and it was our absolute pleasure to assist you.We look forward to seeing you again soon!Kindest Regards,Maria Wittorp-DejongeChef Concierge
1	Great Stay for Rush University Medical very accommodating. What an amazing staff and property. We had to make a last minute emergency medical trip to Chicago. Arrived early morning and went directly to the hospital. Nighttime came and we had no idea where to stay. Hospital staff said there was a Marriott directly across the street. We made an online reservation and showed up around midnight. The desk staff was terrific, the room was outstanding and they couldnt do enough for us to get settled in. Stayed for nearly a week. The concierge lounge is great. And The gentleman that staffs the lounge in the morning is one terrific guy. His name is Ray. Ray made each morning visit wonderful. He was so accommodating and helpful. This man should be recognized as employee of the Marriott Corporation!Every employee was just great. And the on-site restaurant staff wonderful as well. And every front desk shift true hospitality professionals. While we did have a AAA discount they applied the Rush Medical rate. It really helped us out. A great property. Nice big and clean rooms. If you need to be at any of the nearby hospitals this is the place!Thanks guys!!!! Thank you so much for such wonderful feedback! We are glad you enjoyed your stay and we have shared your feedback with the staff. We hope to accommodate you in the future
1	Enjoyable stay. We checked in here for four nights before moving to our apartment in San Diego, this hotel is in hotel circle, so not many bars and restaurant are around, but its 20 mins walking distance to fashion valley, so if you love shopping, do take advantage of that! The Zacks bar in the hotel has happy hour every day from 4 to 7, we really liked that. Thank you for your comments regarding your recent stay. We are happy to hear you enjoyed your stay. We are also pleased to hear you liked the happy hour in our bar. Hopefully well welcome you back for a stay-cation or even just for happy hour. Thank you!
0	Lower your expectations and you may enjoy your stay..... We stayed at this hotel last year for 10 nights and while the rooms weren't completely up to date, it was clean, had extra room, breakfast was decent, and for the price we felt we got a great deal. Based on our past experience, we booked again for a family reunion and referred our family to also book this hotel. We arrived late at night and check in was fine. The lobby still looked nice and the elevator was still slow like we remembered. The first thing we noticed when we got to our room and turned the bed down were the yellow stains on the sheets. At this point I wasn't sure if the sheets had been laundered and they were permanent stains, or if the sheets had not been changed. I called the front desk and they had me come get a new set of sheets. By the time I got back up to the room, my husband had discovered the towels hanging in the bathroom had fresh lipstick/makeup all over them. I went back to talk to the front desk and the employee decided it was time to try a different room. Room 2 had a ant on top of the pillows on the bed and when we turned down the bed and pulled the pillows away from the headboard out ran 10 more. Back to the front desk we went and were now headed off to room 3. When opening the door to Room 3 we were immediately hit with what I can only describe as B.O. and it was potent. I called the front desk and told them about the smell and told them we would tough it out for the night as it was getting super late and we had a baby with us. I asked when the manager would be in the next day and was told 10 a.m. I ran the air vent on the airconditioner and also turned on the bathroom exhaust fan all night. The next morning the smell was as bad as ever. It literally was oozing out of everything in the room-the mattress, the couch. There were ants in this room also, but they were crawling on the wall instead of instead of in the bed. I headed down to visit with the manager of the hotel and found he was out due to an emergency. I expressed my concerns to the staff that was there (the housekeeping supervisor and a young gentleman) and asked to cancel the rest of my stay as well as the reservations for my family that would be arriving in town later in the week. The housekeeping supervisor came up to the room and acknowledged the smell and thought that it was possibly wet carpet-my opinion was that the room smelled due to body odor and not cleaning the room thoroughly. The only rooms the hotel had left were double rooms and she offered to let me walk through one before moving all of my belongings again, but I declined as we had already switched rooms 3 times and I also was very concerned about how many times my family coming into town would have to switch rooms to find an acceptable one.This hotel has drastically gone down hill in cleanliness since we stayed here last year. The linens in all of the rooms were stained and the towels were threadbare and grey. There were ants in 2 of the 3 rooms we checked into that night. I felt this hotel was along the lines of a motel 6 at best. Free breakfast cannot make up for a filthy hotel that is not being cleaned properly. We actually witnessed a maid RUNNING into and out of a room in less than 5 minutes. How do you clean a room that fast And we certainly didn't see a vacuum. We were wondering if the maids were paid by the room and not the hour. I do want to say the front desk staff was very accommodating and tried their hardest to find an acceptable room and I appreciate that they were willing to cancel our reservations when they realized their hotel had too many issues. ****PLEASE HIRE A SUPERVISOR FOR YOUR MAIDS AND INVEST IN REPL.ACING OLD/STAINED LINENS AND TOWELS***Thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey regarding your recent stay at the Comfort Suites Mission Valley SeaWorld Area in San Diego. Allow me to apologize on behalf of Choice Hotels for failing to meet your expectations regarding your overall experience on your recent visit.

0	hair everywhere. There was Hair in the pool there was hair in the bathroom there was hair in the hotel room there was hair everywhere. There was a night club in the hotel of some sort that made it impossible to park and made my 2 kids and I feel unsafe in the parking lot.
0	Would not stay again. Room was not clean and smelled. Hotel culture needs improvement and need better staff training. Management need to be trained in hospitality.
1	Great place!. I stayed for three days and I quite enjoyed it. It's quite a distance from the Strip but the mellowness and the view from my room was worth it. Although the decor in the rooms were a little outdated, they were very clean and very SPACIOUS! The one thing I liked about the rooms was that it did not have the adjoining locked doors to the next room, so privacy was well in tact. The safe and fridge were also a plus. Adding to the spaciousness, the bathrooms was quite also large. I had two sinks in one area and then the toilet and shower in a separate part of the bathroom separated by a door. I ate at the buffet for the three days I was there. The selection of food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner was the same each day but was worth the price especially if you signed up for the casino card. You can't beat eating at a buffet for 8+ for breakfast and 11+ for dinner. Sorry, I could not remember how much I paid exactly, but know for sure that it was way cheaper to eat there than at one of the buffets at the Strip. I'd definately stay here again!
1	Great room for the money.. The hotel was lovely and the staff was great...very helpful with directons around the city. My husband, our adult daughter stayed here for the weekend. The only complaint is that the bed needs to be replaced and the sleep sofa was very short even when fully opened. The bed was very soft which caused us to roll toward the middle. The rooom was very clean and nicely appointed with a good sized flat screen TV. The AC worked well. The best part of this hotel is that if you plan to stay more than a few days, the room comes with a small kitchen that has the basics...dishes, pots, pans,etc. and a dishwasher.
1	Well worth the stay. This is my first trip to San Francisco and therefore my first - but not last- say at the Rex, I'm back here is 4 days.This hotel was recommended to me by friends and they were spot on. I arrived here mid morning after a long flight from Australia and the wonderful desk staff let me into my room early, a quiet one at the back and very comfortable, room 404. They also helped me arrange some activities.I love wine hour at the bar, a free glass of wine, a chat to the barman and a read and relax. It's been a great way to unwind each afternoon.Good bed, great pillows, clean and with character. I'm looking forward to being back on Thursday.Thanks so much for the great review. Please let me know when you return to the Rex and we will make sure you are well taken care of!-Ina
0	Fleas, smoke, dirty towel. Booked online at the last minute. The hallways reek of cigarette and marijuana smoke, the hand towel was dirty with a lip stock kiss mark, there were fleas in the air conditioner unit, breakfast was substandard. I only stayed here because it was the only place I could find. Next time I will be more proactive.
0	Couldn't wait to check out!. I didn't mind the small room, but I didn't like that it was old and dirty. ICK. I honestly couldn't wait to check out in the morning. The hallways had a heavy smoke smell, and then my room had a heavy perfume smell. What were they trying to cover up To top it off, the walls are paper thin. Not... More
0	Not 5 Star Lacks Value for Money. Lacks true value for money Stayed here twice now, and there's no doubting this is a fancy hotel inside and out. However, be prepared for staff not carrying out their duties properly, excessive queues at check-in and check-out, and long walks across the casino to get from the elevators to the front door. Then there's another long walk before you... More
0	Not the worst place to stay but had some issues. We had two rooms for the weekend and we may have just been there on a bad weekend or something because we planned on leaving around 830 on sunday morning and upon waking up there was no hot water, one of the rooms air conditioning units had stopped working in the middle of the night and it was a humid evening, so we went to the continental breakfast to find no toaster and stale fruit loops. Hot water was available but not until about 1030 so we were about 3 hours behind schedule when all is said and done and we had to stop and grab some breakfast.
0	Oops...oh darn...... Upon our arrival and during our stay the staff was the highlight. There was plenty of toilet paper, but the holder would not hold it up. The water was hot and pressure good, but the handle kept falling off. The bed was very comfortable and clean. It was in the morning we found unwelcome guest in our clothes.....very small ants!!!! We have only stayed at this Drury once and of course I cannot speak for the other rooms, but I will not stay there again. The staff was wonderful and our bill was adjusted very nicely, but the vermin bite! The hotel is in a great location to down town and the port if you are cruising.Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback from your stay with us. Also, thank you for pointing out the items that were not working properly while you were here. As you experienced, we have no problem fixing things when we are made aware and making them right. One item that did not get fixed until you were gone was the sugar ants, but I want to let you know that too has been resolved the day you checked-out we had an exterminator come in and treat the room, and then revisit it a week later.I am sorry this was not a memorable trip for the right reasons, but I appreciate your kind words about the team. I hope to have the opportunity to serve you as a guest again.Sincerely,Patrick D.General Manager
1	Very nice hotel and convenient. Hotel has a nice lobby and check-in was nice and quick. Had a morning flight in and got to the hotel by 12 PM. They had my room ready and they were able to accommodate my request to be on the same floor as my brother's room. The room itself was just right for a family of four and the bathroom was a very nice size to accommodate the girl's toiletries and the boy's minimal essentials. Bathroom had tub separate from a nice size shower stall. As for the hotel location, only a block away from Pacific Place mall which had restaurants and a movie theater. The hotel was also only 7 blocks away from Pike Place Market which we practically went to every day. Very convenient to public transportation to and from airport as well as to the Space Needle. Definitely would stay in this hotel again if the opportunity arises.
0	A place to rest. My daughter and I were in Lafayette for a soccer tournament and this is where the team was set up to stay. We booked the room for a reasonable rate and I assumed there would be some due diligence as to the hotel and its conditions. After some research we found that the hotel was undergoing renovations. We requested to... More
1	Best Boutique Hotel in Key West!. The Saint Hotel in Key West is by far the very best boutique hotel on the island. The staff is beyond amazing - gracious and accommodating in every manner. Thank you for making every day a great day!The hotel and grounds are spotless, the pool area is an amazing place to totally unwind and relax. The music is perfect, and the sounds of the waterfall really set you up for a great day in the sun of Key West!My room was beautifully appointed with marble floors, modern furnishings, and a large marble bath. House keeping and turn down service was exceptional as well.I would compare The Saint to a 1,000 a night boutique hotel in South Beach - the vibe is cool, and you will not find it anywhere else in Key West!After staying here for a week, I HIGHLY recommend The Saint and can tell you this is the ONLY hotel in Key West that I will be staying at in the future - it can't be beat!Thank you for choosing The Saint Hotel and for the amazing review. Being a new hotel we depend on our reviews and we appreciate the wonderful words. We'll see you next time you're in Key West.
0	Thought could trust Marriott name - wrong!. Planned last 4 nights of a month long vacation for this property. Wanted some quiet space to just relax, organize for the trip back home. Called ahead to confirm would have room with good view as planned to spend time in room enjoying. Terribly disappointed when arrived (Fri - 5 PM) to look out to view of street and parking lot. Immediately asked for another room -- they refused to change as said they were going to be full -- but it was obvious many many had not checked in yet -- could have changed, but did not want to bother. Furnishings were dingy, room hot - had to replace thermostat in room second day returned to room one evening after long day in city to find room had not been cleaned. Just over all - not what you expect as a loyal Marriott Rewards member. Do not recommend this property.
1	Anniversary Trip. Great Stay. Luke at the front desk was awesome. Great location in and off of the freeway. The hotel is exactly as the pictures that are posted. The pool was outside however, most Hilton Garden Inns have it in the inside. Overall great stay. Our room on the 8th floor had a spectacular view.Thank you so much for the outstanding review of your recent stay at Hilton Garden Inn Dallas/Market Center. We're so glad you enjoyed your stay and were pleased with the location and amenities, and our uniquely wonderful Luke! We appreciate your comments and look forward to welcoming you again.
1	Great location at a reasonable price.. This motel is in an excellent location at a reasonable price for the area. The room was very clean and had a refrigerator and microwave. It is about a five minute drive from the downtown area. If you are a Best Western Rewards member, the room charge includes a breakfast at Denny's, which is located on the same property. It is not the regular breakfast menu however, it has a variety of selections and we were happy with the amount of food provided.cinann - Thank you for taking the time to write this review. Our entire staff takes pride in our hotel and it shows inside and out. Our prices are very reasonable for the Napa Valley. Being just a few minutes from Downtown Napa and wineries in the area, you just can't beat that. Thank you for being a Best Western Rewards Member and we hope you visit us again soon. Genafer, Director of Sales
0	Do not stay here!. We were booked here thru Air Transat package. The location is convenient, the staff is really nice. However, everything else is bad! The bed spreads were stained. The bed skirt was ripped. The bathtub was broken with holes..... rust..... definitely not clean. there was hair everywhere. The only thing they did was fresh paint! There is one chair in the room and it was stained. There were stains in the ceiling, looked like a leak.It was a three star on the website but this cant be more than 2**DO NOT BOOK HERE!
1	Nice hotel in a great location. The Diva is in a great location close to the heart of San Francisco with easy access to Fishermans habour. The staff were friendly and accommodating. Easily accessed via public transport, bus and BART to and from the airport and tram or easy walk to Fishermans Habour. The room was small but as we were only in San Francisco for 2 nights it worked nicely for us. If you were planning on staying longer and needed more space I would contact the Diva directly and discuss options as they have larger rooms. Really enjoyed our stayThank you for being our guest and sharing your recent stay! We are pleased to hear you loved our central location for exploring the city and were well taken care of by our friendly staff. Your feedback means a lot to us and we hope to welcome you back again soon!
0	Would Not Recommend. Not a very well kept place. Cockroaches had fun traveling around the room and bathroom. Owner thought it was her right to park in the handicap parking because it was convenient for her. Coffee pot did not work. Will not return.
0	Overbooked. We booked this accommodation in February, and paid in May, but when we arrived there in June an extremely unhelpful receptionist threw us a piece of paper which stated they were overbooked and we would have to stay at the Quality Inn around a mile away.He then reluctantly gave us directions after being asked a few times. I know all hotels overbook but surely it's common courtesy to let you know before you arrive after a 9 hour flight and a couple of more hours getting through immigration, picking up a car and driving there.
0	Terrible Shower. With the exception of the shower, this is a reasonably nice hotel in a nice part of town. However, the water saver on the shower was to an extreme... it was barely more than a trickle. Showering took much longer. Even just thoroughly wetting my hair took a while. In the end, it took what seemed at least twice as... More
1	Great location, small but comfy rooms. This hotel is a Club Quarters hotel, which means that it is geared towards business travelers. Our room was small, but perfectly adequate since we weren't in Chicago to spend time in our hotel room. The hotel reminded me of a European hotel, especially since it's in an old building. The location is perfect right across the street from the River, near Michigan Ave. between the Magnificent Mile and the Loop. The hotel restaurant is surprisingly good, and makes the famous Chicago deep dish pizza. The couple at the table next to us were staying at the Fairmont and their concierge recommended it.

In regards to your experience here at our hotel, I was wondering if it might be possible that you might have mistaken our hotel for another. You mentioned that our gym has since been shut down....More
1	Great service, clean rooms. I've actually stayed at this hotel twice and both times I didn't encounter any issues I received great customer service and clean rooms. The location of the hotel was perfect because it was about a 5-10 min walk from the Powell St. BART station. That made it really convenient to travel from SFO to the hotel and for only about 9. It is on the border of the Tenderloin area (which I guess is not the greatest area, lots of homeless people, kinda sketchy) and Union Square. When you exit the hotel to the right where Starbucks is, you are on the busier side where all the shops and restaurants are, and when you exit to the left where the valet parking is, its a lot less crowded and more homeless people. The room itself was small and cozy with a petite queen bed. The decor was nice and modern but still felt very welcoming and comfortable. The bathroom was really clean and had no issues there. Had plenty of hot water. I was on the 15th floor and you could still hear some street noise but it didn't really bother me enough to want to change rooms to a higher floor, but if that's something you know will bother you then maybe ask for the higher up floors beware though floors in the twenties are upgraded rooms and you will be charged. Housekeeping was friendly and kept the rooms clean and well stocked. Overall, I think this will be a base hotel for me when I travel to SF. It has everything that I need and location works for me. It is a little pricey but what decent clean hotel isn't in this city And yes, parking is expensive at 50/night, but then again it is in the city surrounded by other hotels who also charge an arm and a leg for parking. Oh yeah, it was great having Starbucks in the hotel so you can grab some breakfast and take it up to the room while getting ready.
1	Fun and convenient. I had searched for a long time for the right place as it is very expensive in San Francisco. For us this was the perfect location, wharf, pier 39, alcatraz, shops, restaurants, groceries, public transport all in your backyard. The hotel is modern and clean, beds are only double and feel very small especially if you are use to a king like us. Room is also pretty small but is ok for a short 3 night stay. Staff here are super friendly and at check in explained how we would catch the train to the NBA game. The games room is great and check in and out was a breeze. Greetings deewill47,We never tire hearing that Hotel Zephyr was the perfect place to stay in San Francisco. The Z team knows all the great spots in the city and love providing memorable experiences for guests. Hopefully you can come back when the Warriors get back to the Finals!Kind Regards,Jason WilliamsGeneral Manager
0	Needs Improvement. Rooms were large, bed was comfortable, location was adequate. Motel needs some serious updates. Renovations are a must. Outside area was dirty and customers were allowed to work on their automobiles in the parking lots. My spouse and I will not again stay again without some of these things are fixed.
1	Buffet on a Budget. As Budget style hotels go, this one still benefits from its newness. The lobby grabs you as you enter. You'd swear you're just steps from a beach but you're in the middle of the mountains.Props to the staff! Carla Bhumi. Once you check in you are in good hands and on a very quality property. However, don't expect to check in before check in time. So, if you arrive early, expect to be told not yet. Parking right next to the hotel is limited. But there is a satellite lot just a few more steps away. Not a problem, unless it's raining. Speaking of which, it did on our trip, just enough to not be able to enjoy the outdoor pool which looked very inviting!The indoor pool does not allow any eating or drinking...eh not a fan of that policy. There is no smoking on the property, not even on your own balcony. Understandable because you're pretty close to your neighbors, but still would have liked to enjoy a cigar and beer in the evenings. Instead there's a rickety table and chair in the corner of the parking lot you can traipse to if you have to smoke. OK, unless it's raining.The rooms are exquisite - for budget style hotels. And you can't beat the location, right next to the Island at Pigeon Forge. Several attractions are within walking distance but drivers in Pigeon Forge are horrible. Some don't even look before they turn and run red lights. If you're with kids, be on the lookout.If you can't get enough Jimmy Buffet lifestyle, there's a Margaritaville restaurant and Margaritaville coffee shop less than a 5 minute walk away.Also, need to mention, the breakfast they serve is a cut above those you would find at other breakfast included budget hotels.This place is really done right. Would love to stay here again on my next visit to Pigeon Forge.Thank you for staying at our hotel and for sharing your great feedback. We are so happy your enjoyed your visit and look forward to seeing you during your next visit to Pigeon Forge.
0	Disaster!. I had a late flight in so I was tired when I arrived. The staff was polite and tried hard to be accomodating however to start with the remote wold not work, so I was told to come down and get battery, this didn't work so they finally got another. The room was dirty, the sink leaked all over everytime you ran water and when trying to shower in the morning the water was only lukewarm!!
1	Outstanding service. First time in New Orleans, planned to stay here for 3 nights but ended up staying for 5. Mainly because he owners, Lauren and Daniel are such excellent hosts. Great advice on where to go and what to do, nothing better than a local to give you advice. The hotel was quiet when we were there so Lauren and Daniel sat with us a breakfast and helped us plan our day. Rooms spotlessly clean. All of their suggestions were spot on. Good little pool with sun deck, unusual for a BB. We visited the WW11 museum which is outstanding but allow at least 4 hours for your visit. Burboun St was a disappointment, but go to Frenchman St for great music and food. Try 30/90o bar for music. Highly recommended and within walking distance, is the Lounge (best ribs ever). Another reviewer spoke of the area, we drove down from Houston and arrived about 6pm, we were slightly concerned as the area has some building with a lot of graffiti on them, however they are being developed and the owners said the area has changed a great deal over the last few years, and is becoming one of NO sought after places to live. Its abut a 5/10 minute trip by uber/taxi into the French quarter. Altogether a great place to stay and would highly recommend.
0	Spend the same, get WAY better stay elsewhere. Good location, good size of apartment, but that it, bathroom in the living room smelled like pee with less than half a roll of toilet paper available, there was a pube in the drawer of the fridge which is hilarious because the notice of the entrance says the fridge is always cleaned prior to every visit. There is not cable, they have those antennas that try to find local channels so I spent the entire time watching PBS Kids because it was the only channel the antenna would take in. Doors are very dirty, balcony doors would not lock, furniture is beat up, bed squeaky and would sink so deep I could feel the springs,extra blanket very stinky smell like it was overused and never washed, closet door missing, hairballs in the bathroom, and everything was VERY VERY dusty. SOOO NOT what this place made it to believe it was for the price. It looked like the person who cleaned this place did not care to do their job and it was either never done, or I was given a room that had not been touched in months. Go spend the same elsewhere and get a better experience, or spend less and still get a way better experience.Dear seviemj, thank you so much for taking the time to leave us a feedback of your experience. We are deeply sorry for the inconveniences you experienced, we are checkin all of our apartments to determine which one is the one in discussion as we are already addressing the issue with the housekeeping supervisors to avoid any further issues like this one.
0	Housekeeper steals. Make sure to keep your 'do not disturb' sign on your door, and check the room thoroughly before you check out. As soon as housekeeper already went through your room, anything they find, they'll stash it away. You will not get your belongings back and housekeeping will lie about not seeing anything.

I also noticed when I woke up that it... More
1	Nice Hotel at Good Price. My wife and I recently stayed at this hotel for one night while we were vacationing in Napa Valley with another couple. The hotel is located in a commercial area, so it lacks the ambiance of a hotel that is located in the hear of wine country. And it is a bit of a longer drive to get to the main roads where the wineries are located.That being said, the lobby of the hotel is very nicely appointed and they do have a good offering of bottles of wine for sale. The staff at the front desk were very nice and were helpful with recommendations and directions. Our room was very comfortable. There was plenty of space and the beds were firm and friendly. The bathroom was clean and included the expected amenities. It was also a very good value, as similar hotels in the area were significantly more expensive. If you're looking for a comfortable place to stay close to Napa Valley and you're not looking for a romantic experience, this hotel would be an excellent choice.Dear ltt18,Thanks for taking the time to write your review of the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We appreciate your valuable feedback. As our location is less than 2 miles to downtown we are very close to several wineries in surrounding areas like the Carneros area as well as conveniently near the entrance to highway 29 to reach the other wineries up the valley. It's great to hear that the staff was nice and provided you with recommendations as well as directions to your destinations. At Hampton we provide a great value with complementary breakfast, parking and internet just to name a few. Thank you again for staying with us and we hope to see you on your next trip to Napa. Best Regards, Serina Najar.
1	A Hidden Gem in La Jolla. This property has only been here six years. It reminds of the La Quinta Resort and Spa in La Quinta, just east of Palm Desert. We got a great price then upgraded to a suite for only 49 more. The rooms was spacious and nicely appointed. The Suite was secluded from other rooms with a private entrance which made it seem more special. We also had our valet parking comped. Along with top shelf, we are here to serve you attitude, which is not that common these days. Smiles abound from the staff and the place is marvelously appointed. Two highlights were the heavenly bedding and a light in the closet which is motion sensor before the door actually opens. The TV in the living room was undersized to the higher end hotels. Two private balconies, and all the nice lotion and soap extras, in the bathIt is off of Torrey Pines road, so you can drive by it and not see it, unless you are looking for it. Really great Hotel, wish we had more time here.
1	Stay Here!. My wife and I were in town for a concert event. We were really impressed with the staff at this location. When we arrived the clerk advised about walking to the French Quarter from the hotel and the best routes to take, especially after dark. We decided last minute to drive to the concert because of weather concerns. The concert did not end until late and when we returned to the hotel the gate was shut at the entrance. My wife ran in and asked the clerk who came out promptly and opend the gate. The parking was a little tight especially since I drive a large SUV but amazingly I had no problems parking. Overall I could not have been happier with our stay. The price could have been better but that is always the case. I will return to this location in the near future with the rest of my family and have no problems recommending it to friends.
0	Don't stay there!!!!!. Service, food and staff are the worse! What more can I say!!!The front desk staff was completely worthless, had no knowledge of any questions I asked! No bar as advertised! Homeless people on the sidewalk of hotel. Felt like I was in the wrong neighborhood for sure. Don't stay there unless you want a dirty room and no service!
1	Loved our just renovated room.. We became timeshare owners 12 years ago, and we travel a lot. This was our first time ever to stay at our home property. The service was wonderful, the staff pleasant, and the suites beautiful. It wa a wonderful stay. Two critiques, 1. the movie that was played in the evening was rated PG13, and our small children 3 and 6 were not able to stay in the pool because of it, and when we went to the other pool, it was a lot of young adults smoking and drinking.Thank you for a perfect review, Cat! We are happy to hear you enjoyed your villa here at Marriott's Grand Chateau. Your feedback is very important to us and has been shared with our senior resort management.
1	Well worth the price!. I used to live in San Diego and remember this area as filled with street walkers. I'm glad to report that the area has been cleaned up. The motel is very nice and comfortable. I like the tile floors. WiFi is speedy. Free breakfast is cereal and pastries.Welcome back to San Diego! It sounds like things have changed for the better. We are glad you trusted our accommodations to provide you with the comfort you were seeking. It is great to know our WiFi worked appropriately and you had a chance to take advantage of our complimentary breakfast. Thank you for sharing your positive comments with us and we hope to see you again during your next trip back to San Diego.
0	Awful!!!! Stinky!!! Old Dirty!!!!. This hotel, The Colorado Bell, is so bad. It desperately needs to be renovated and cleaned. I cannot even begin to say how bad, dirty, old and smelly it was.

1	Great hotel and location. The Aloft hotel is in an excellent location, it is right next to city hall and the market and walking distance to so many other shops and restaurants. The hotel itself is extremely clean as was the hotel room. The room was on the smaller side, but if you're like me and my husband, you're not there to spend all your time in the room. It was plenty of space for the two of us. The bar downstairs is nice, we each enjoyed a cocktail there one of the nights. The only negative I would say is the expensive valet parking, however we went one block north on broad st and found parking for 15 dollars a day. Overall a great stay and highly recommended. Lindsay,Thank you for your kind words! We truly are fortunate to be in the heart of so many great things that Philadelphia offers. I am so glad to see that you enjoyed your stay so much, and that you were able to relax not only in your room, but at WXYZ Bar as well. I look forward to welcoming you back the next time you visit our fine city!Best,Andrew DrydenAssistant General Manager
1	Byron was awesome!. This hotel had free parking and was in a perfect location! Any time I called the hotel and even when i got checked in Byron was super friendly.He was always very curtious and knew what he was talking about which is needed in the hotel business. He made our two night stay stay enjoyable!Only downfall is no hot tub like the website says!Thank you so much for your review of our property, we appreciate that you took the time to share your experience.Byron has been a great addition to our staff and is completely focused on the customer and works to make every guest feell special. The free parking and location are really a great amenity for the Buckhead area.I apologize about the hot tub. We removed the hot tub last July and have removed that amenity from most websites - - I will continue to look at sites and attempt to make the necessary corrections.
0	Bathroom issues. The room was okay. But bathroom extremely small. Also, it looked like the beginnings of black mold in between the caulking of the shower/bath tub surfaces. Toilet very low to the ground.... The uncomfortable contribution of the bathroom set the precedence for the sentiments felt about the hotel. But, it was a good location and the front desk staff were very helpful in pinpointing attractions and waterfalls in the area. I can't really comment on breakfast since we slept in and missed it daily
1	Convenient, cute and moderately comfrotable. The hotel is just one of many that are on this new trend of firmer pillows and mattresses. This is the third hotel I have stayed in the last few months that have had firmer vs softer mattresses in their rooms. Aside from the bed The room was well appointed, comfortable and really The bonus Those super plushy and comfy robes in the closet. I miss a good hotel robe and this one had one!! Another little thing I loved was the spa water and coffee service in the lobby. High quality coffee and the New York Times Count me in! The maid service was friendly, attentive, and I even got a little note. Would totally stay again.
1	Nice place but some glitches with charges. The hotel is great and the refurbishment is outstanding. Very large rooms with nice amenities. Downside is that they don't tell you that they require a 100 per day hold on your credit card for miscellaneous incidentals until you check in. That being said, they charged me 600.00 instead of 300.00 and then took 3-5 business days to refund. Due to their error their staff has offered to refund any issues this caused with bank/credit card. Overall the area and the hotel were great, but several guests at our conference had similar charging experiences.Thank you for your recent stay at the Loews Philadelphia Hotel. While I am pleased to hear you enjoyed our large rooms and nice amenities, I apologize for the issues you encountered with incidental charges. Thank you again for your review and we hope you will afford us another opportunity with a return visit in the future.
1	Nice room but a lot of hidden costs. The rooms are very clean and bed and linens are excellent. There is a tub/shower and a single sink. I was surprised it did not have a separate shower. The layout of the resort is confusing and somewhat difficult to find your way around. There is a very nice coffee/snack shop. The staff was very accommodating. There is a 30 per night resort fee which includes amenities that are customarily included in the base rate for comparable accommodations. In addition, they charge 25 per night for self-parking. It is well located between Del Mar and La Jolla. I did not eat here, but in conversation with others, the restaurant has a good reputation.
1	Beautiful vacation. This hotel was perfect for a girls trip over labor day! For years we'd gone to Ocean City but this year we did not want to get overrun with labor day crowds and we happened to find Chincoteague. It was the perfect choice, even on labor day the traffic was minimal, it was quiet and the beach was not very crowded at all. The hotel is a short 10 minute drive from the beautiful beach so we could go any time. The room was very clean, updated, comfortable and spacious with a gorgeous view of the bay. Swimming in the outdoor pool overlooking the water makes you feel like you are on a tropical island. The staff is incredibly nice, helping us with directions and anything else we needed. It made a huge difference that we could pay a little extra and extend our checkout time to 7pm! We were able to have a whole extra day at the beach before having to pack up and go home, it was great! We are looking forward to our next vacation at the Comfort Suites!
1	Good experience and good value. We have stayed at several Extended Stay America properties in the past because we like the suite layout with the kitchen and it's reasonably priced. The big difference we have found at this location is the extremely friendly and helpful staff, on all of the shifts. We have family in San Diego and it's very pleasant to visit them but it's nice to be able to come back to a comfortable, clean and convenient 'place of own' in a nice centrally located area.The property and the rooms are well cared for. Looking forward to going back in April when our next granddaughter will arrive!Thank you for taking the time write a review of your stay. I'm so pleased that we are able to provide a home away from home while you are visiting relatives in San Diego. We look forward to welcoming you back in April when your granddaughter arrives! Thank you for sharing your experience with us. We look forward to welcoming you back in April!
0	No hot water and staff could care less. Room musty and not well ventilated. No hot water in show despite multiple trips to the front desk to ask for assistance or another room. Front desk staff asked if I turned the knob the opposite way Hotel staff made no effort to move us to another room or fix the problem. Will not be staying here again.
1	My new favorite hotel in SF. First time staying at this hotel, last minute booking. Usually stay at the Parc 55 Hotel or the Westin, this boutique hotel is hands down a much better experience from the friendly staff and easy check in to the comfy bed and nice clean and spacious room. Great location next to the gateway into China Town yet still fairly quiet even on the 3rd floor.Dear Irma,Thank you for your compliments. I am grateful that you chose the Orchard Garden hotel. It is nice to know that you enjoyed our accommodations and our entire team. We love our location as it is only a few blocks away from a lot of the attractions in the city.When you are visiting San Francisco in the future we hope to see you at the Orchard Garden hotel.Sincerely,Bruce PinckneyFront Office ManagerOrchard Garden Hotel
0	painful. Room was huge, continental breakfast in the morning, good location close to airport, friendly staff - everything great, except the bed bugs. Unfortunately, that's a deal breaker - woke up with about 30 bites on hands, legs neck. Hopefully you won't get the same room. If the bugs were gone, my quality value ratings would be high!
0	Gross. I was so disappointed in this property! Threadbare, torn carpet, no guest services until 6am, dingy outside. I didn't feel comfortable the entire time I was there. Does not look anything like the photos posted. Until they do a major renovation, find another place to stay.
1	Awesome Location. We stayed at Ocean Park for 3 nights. We got a partial oceanview room and enjoyed our view. The property is on the beach (once you cross the boardwalk), so the location can't be beat and we are glad we stayed on-site so to speak as parking was hard to come by.The staff is very friendly and the pool area was very nice. Our room was comfortable and clean. The breakfast could have been a little better. Not too many choices and one day, they ran out of milk and juice. The boardwalk has a selection of restaurants and shops. We ate at Waterbar and it was good. Sandbox Pizza is good too and they will deliver. The hotel is in the Pacific Beach area which can get a little rowdy at night. We had no problems of things being loud and people were very respectful. The actual beach itself can be an issue. Make sure to find a place that doesn't have a lot of kelp or seaweed. That was a problem and then flies joined in. Be selective on where you set up shop. The water was chilly at first, but beautiful, we enjoyed our time there! Walk a few blocks to the Baked Bear ice cream shop - they make custom ice cream sandwiches. You won't be disappointed!
1	Great hotel with fantastic service. Our room was beautiful, the location was wonderful just a couple of blocks from shopping, Bourbon Street and an easy walk to Jackson Square. There are great restaurants in walking distance as well as the restaurant in the hotel. Dinner in the vault was fabulous.The service was outstanding.Even one of the maintenance men held doors for me and gave great advice on where to eat. Loved it and can't wait to go back. Thanks especially to Jason who really took great care of us.We appreciate your recent visit to the Whitney Hotel and are so happy to hear you enjoy your stay! We'll pass along your kind comments to the staff and we look forward to hosting your next New Orleans trip! Feel free to call the hotel directly for any travel needs. Thank you, Casey A.

1	Cool base for a trip. 1950's bone redone quite recently in an area that is being rejuvenated. Not much available within walking distance yet. Comfy motel-type room, dingy key, on-site restaurant. Great breakfast if heavy on carb side.Close enough to tourist attraction to serve as a base for your visit.Weekend starts on Thu with music by the really nice pool. Don't know how loud it is since I left before weekend. A factor to consider.Thank you for staying with us. Yes we totally renovated the entire hotel in 2014 - mid century modern architecture and design. We are centrally located as w are only 15 minutes away from the airport, 10 minutes away from Wynwood and the Design District, and 20 minutes away from South Beach. We have live entertainment on the pool deck Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights but our policy is to turn down the music at 11 pm and turn it off at midnight. We hope to see you back at the Vagabond very soon !
1	Classy Hotel close to everything. Stayed at this delightful hotel for 4 nights, beautiful old building rich with history. Very convenient to many local attractions across the road from the beautiful city hall building. Rooms are clean and very comfortable.Also close by is Reading Terminal Market, a must visit for foodies, great place to eat any time.The bonus is having a Starbucks kiosk in the lobby. I highly recommend this hotel in the city of brotherly love.Dear Melinda1966,Thank you for sharing your fabulous review of the Courtyard Philadelphia Downtown. We receive many positive comments about our convenient location from the guests, and we are glad to know you had a comfortable time with us. Your recommendation is truly appreciated, and we look forward to impressing you again on your next trip to this area. Thank you,David KiddAssistant General Manager
0	We had go through 3room before we got comfortable. Fighting outside the room dirty room mold room TV only had two working channel I won't come back better experience first time
0	The worst business Hotel, ever. The Westin San Diego has no Customer service or satisfaction, at all. They only try to get as much money out of your pocket as possible, they are 100 inflexible, the response in communication is very slow, you need to send questions a couple time to get the right answers, they send important information last minute or after a couple time of re-asking, Pro-activity is certainly one thing they are not aware of and the capacity-chart they send is far beyond any reality.Lavalampe0815 - I am sorry to hear of your recent experience and would be happy to connect personally with you to further discuss. Your experience does not mirror the normal guest experience here at the Westin San Diego and it is unfortunate I am learning of this through Trip Advisor. Please feel free to contact me directly. Sincerely, Alyssa TurowskiGeneral Manager
0	Construction all around, difficult access, minimum comfort rooms, cranky staff.. Sure, I read the reviews that people wrote before we booked a room.....but I thought, some people just expect too much. I was wrong, I admit it, it definately IS as bad as people say. Oh of course this place will always have a lot of guests because it is so close to Seattle Center (about 2-1/2 blocks). The SPH owner knows this and probably feels he doesn't have to fix anything. Where do I start hmmm.. STAFF: although most are friendly, the early morning staffer is old, grumpy and smells like he hasn't taken a shower in a week. Someone spilled coffee in the breakfast room and he was swearing up a storm. He also was cranky when we complained our card key to our room didn't work. The owner/manager is also not too much of a people person. THE ROOM: our card key never worked very well, usually had to simultaneously wiggle the card back and forth in the slot, and give the door a kick. We had 3 different staff people on each day of our 3-day stay come up and open the room door for us because the key didn't work. The AC unit was behind a curtain (had to place the curtain on a chair to get air flow), was set at 60 degrees and the temperature adjustment button was broken (the room gets VERY hot without AC). The TV is very complicated to operate with a wall switch, two remotes, and a separate power box all needing to be synchronized to get it to work (we had to have a staff person come up to show us how to work it). Extremely bright construction flood lights are on all night outside the room window, so the curtain needs to be tightly closed (see above AC problem making this impossible). BREAKFAST: consists of orange juice, mini-bagels, mini-muffins, and poor coffee...skip breakfast here. The website says that they recently remodeled, but I think it was only the new floor tile in the lobby area because the rest of the place looks like it hasn't been updated since the 1950s. There is currently construction in progress on all sides of the hotel, so walking or driving to and from the parking lot is not the best or convenient. The view from our hotel room window is of the space needle and EMP, which would be great except the view is obscured by construction cranes and cement trucks. They are building a freeway tunnel behind the hotel. If you want to be near downtown, spend a few bucks more and avoid this place. Lowest price is not the best choice in Seattle.First of all, thank you for taking the time to review our property. We constantly try to provide our guests with the best possible service and hospitality, and we're sorry that we didn't meet your needs during your stay. Our policy is to provide great customer service, so we were troubled to hear that our staff was unusually negative towards you. Your concerns have been communicated to the management team to review and address. As far as the construction goes, we're sorry your beautiful view of the Space Needle was obstructed. Unfortunately, this project is out of our control, and we can guarantee that it will improve with the completion of the new tunnel. Finally, we are constantly looking for ways to improve our rooms and make them more comfortable for our guests, so we will take your comments into account. Thank you again for your review, and we hope you'll return to Seattle again soon!
0	Never ever coming back. The service was TERRIBLE and the room was very very dirty..
0	Disappointing stay. The accommodations were fine however the reception staff could definitely benefit from a refresher course in friendly and prompt customer service. I stay an many Choice hotels and was disappointed in my experience with this hotel.
1	Diva-licious!. This is a hidden gem in the Union Square area. There is an adjacent Starbucks for those who can't function without their morning java. The rooms are spacious, and some rooms come with a murphy bed. The dcor is clean and metropolitan, but the window shades have silhouettes of scantily-clad women which some might find unnecessary. The bathrooms, or shall I say toilet rooms have a shower/tub and toilet, while the actual sink is in the room itself. It's difficult not to wake your partner if you get up at night for water or brush your teeth. The staff was uber-friendly! The hotel itself is just steps away from shopping, fine dining, casual dining, and cable cars.Dear Valerie,Im glad to hear we met your expectations during your recent stay with us. Thank you for choosing Hotel Diva. We hope to see again soon.Warm regards,Virgil LopezHotel Manager
0	The bed was comfortable, okay for a nights sleep. This hotel is currently under reconstruction and running business as usual at the same time. Upon entering the hotel many of the carpeted areas are covered in plastic and smell like glue, although there are numerous signs directing travelers to a legend vending machines, there are none and many of the ice machines don't work properly. This week I was in had a small kitchen area, and after running the sink to wash out a couple of glasses, I returned to find a flood on the kitchen floor, calling the front desk, a maintenance man was sent, went on to rebuild the drain pipe, so the water would drain properly.There are very few walking distance stores or restaurants that are open past 11 PM in this area. Next of the front desk is extremely limited store, more of an amenity featuring bottled water and strange flavors of Gatorade. After speaking to one of the desk clerks was directed across the parking lot to their supposedly much more plush Wyndham Hotel to see if they had vending machines, which also seemed to feature bottled water and unusual flavors of Gatorade. Not exactly high quality customer service. They do offer complimentary breakfast, however that ends abruptly at 9 AM, not exactly catering as many hotels run until 10 AM and accommodating the breakfast needs of a road weary traveler as I was. This place needs an upgrade in both customer service, hotel operations, and plumbing. The kitchen and living room areas as well as the bedroom do make for an okay stay, but the overall operations need a major overhaul. I think they're capable of it, they are just not quite there yet.Thank you for your review and I am sorry about the issues you encountered. I did want to let you know that we have a 24 hour a day gift shop attached to the front desk, which has a large selection of items.Thank you again and I hope we see you again soon.
1	Another wonderful stay...with a few misses. My husband and I just returned from yet another wonderful stay at the St Regis San Francisco. Three nights again in a beautiful and spacious Metropolitan Suite with proper blackout shades installed in 2016 per my request. Air con was great as always. Had our dog with us again, too.Service and food/beverage again were fabulous. Spectacular Platinum recognition, as always, due both to my Ambassador level status and the fact that I stay here many times every year. (I'll be back again in late August.)The only misses were:(1) Concierge had sloppy mistakes confusing our party sizes for bookings at 2* Commis and 3* Saison. Created a bit of confusion and a little exasperation when arriving at Saison and booking was under wrong name. Settled but stupid.(2) Twice had calls to butler ring way too long before anyone picked up. Pet peeve of mine.(3) Room service didnt have pork sandwich as per menu for a lunch order, then brought my chicken sandwich ordered without avocado...but with avocado--and not toasted fully. Stupid and not impressive. Replaced quickly and whole lunch order was compd.Obviously, the service recovery was wonderful in each instance. But those are mistakes that this hotel doesn't usually make.Still, we had a truly fabulous stay with amazing service otherwise. Everyone knows us by name. Butler service was fab. Packing and unpacking were great. Pressing and shoe shine were done with aplomb. Great service at the amazing bar, at the restaurant for breakfast, from the front desk, valets, everyone.This still is my favorite hotel by far in SF. And it now ties with the StR NY as my 2 favorites in the whole of the USA.Dear Bill R,Thank you for taking the time to share your review of your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco. We were delighted to welcome you back to the Best Address, and sincerely appreciate your kind words regarding our associates and service. I apologize for the two misses in service, and truly value your comments and feedback. Please do not hesitate to contact us at any time, as we look forward to your next visit to the hotel.Sincerely,Andre BroseHotel Manager
1	Good not great. Nice hotel and great location next to awesome restaurants and the mall. We had a business meeting for a few days and the room was ALWAYS freezing. We asked them like 5x to warm it up and they kept saying they would but never warmed up. Our room was a good size but the bathroom was underwhelming for an upscale hotel. Pool and hot tub are a nice touch. Overall a good stay but not a great one. Thank you for your post. So happy you enjoyed the pool, hot tub and location of the hotel. I am sorry that you had to ask repeatedly to have the thermostat checked in your room and we failed to warm the room up. You can be certain that I have followed up with our team not only regarding your requests not being met but with our engineering staff as well. Our thermostats are motion censored and we will definitely conduct an investigation to ensure they are all in working order and any adjustments made. Especially since the weather is beginning to cool in Atlanta. Please be sure to visit us again when your travels bring you back to the Atlanta area and thank you again for letting us know
1	Excellent experience. We stayed in this hotel for two nights on our way to Destin, Florida. I made a mistake in booking the room. We have four children and I meant to book a suite. I accidentally booked a double queen. Aliya at the front desk very graciously fixed the problem immediately. She was so friendly and accommodating. We were given a great suite right next to the pool - which our kids loved. The room was clean, but we had a problem with the toilet not flushing. Again, this was fixed immediately and in a friendly manner. We did not have another problem with it during our stay. The pool was extremely clean and we used it both days and evenings. The beds were comfortable and there was plenty of room in our suite. The breakfast offered a large variety and was a good value. They also offered a dinner with drinks. We ate out and ate a little from the dinner. My kids had the pasta and said it was good. The staff was extremely helpful with our eating out plans, sight seeing plans, and transportation plans. We've stayed at a lot of hotels and this staff ranks in the top five for helpfulness and friendliness.
0	A very disappointing stay at Ramada. We are repeat guests to Ramada but sadly this will be our last stay as we will be looking to take our family elsewhere. This was our first vacation that we could not wait to get back home. I am employed at one of the leading hotels in Barbados and was very disappointed with the service of the hotel and... More
0	Room quality not good. The 1st room given to us was not clean. it had cob webs,torn carpet and also a cigarette butt. the changed room was cleaner but had cockroach in it. the other rooms were also not of good standard. owner offered us a 50 discount for the next stay and rooms at the updated lake view rooms but with current experience... More
1	Would highly recommend.. Bad: There wasn't anything I didn't like. Good: All staff was very nice and extremely accommodating. The entire property was clean and well kept. The room was clean when we arrived and housekeeping came every morning to clean and verify all was well and if we needed any additional towels, toiletries etc. Their breakfast area was clean, the food was hot and fresh and there was plenty food to go around. I read some guests didn't like the breakfast voucher system but my husband and I liked them because we have stayed at other hotels where there is more people in the breakfast area than there is food. Their Wifi went down while at their business center, they informed me that the system was running slow and that their service provider was on property trying to fix it. I let them know that I was in the middle of a Disney ticket purchase and the front desk staff immediately got their own personal Hotspot set up on their front desk computer. They let me finish my Disney ticket purchase/transaction from their desk....yes from their desk... which i didn't expect. I was really happy cause that saved us alot of time and hassle. The hotel is close to WDW and plenty of dinning. It was overall a wonderful stay, nothing to complain about...other that they could accommodate me the extra day we decide to stay, but that was our fault since we did it last minute. Would HIGHLY recommend.
1	Good for staying near Silver Springs downtown. I booked at this hotel because on the NIH Clinical Center website, it was one of the hotels listed as convenient to the NIH. However, that is false! You can take the metro red line to the NIH, but it will take you a long time, as it is several stops away. One morning, it took me 2 hours from leaving the hotel to arriving at the NIH because there was track maintenance! If you are in town to visit the NIH, I don't recommend staying here. Otherwise, the hotel is fine, the room was a little small, but clean. Also, the elevator interiors could use some upgrading. The carpet was dirty and ragged.
1	Great hotel, close to airport!. Great free shuttle service. So close to the Orlando airport and within walking distance of restaurants. Clean and beautiful with nice pool and fitness center. Fridge and microwave in room with a Keurig! Great cup of morning coffee. And very quiet for being so close to the airport.Thank you for choosing the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport for your stay and for the perfect rating. We are pleased to read that you loved our proximity to the airport as well as nearby restaurants, complimentary shuttle service, and all the amenities and facilities we have to offer. We appreciate your great remarks and do hope to have you back soon!All the Best,Charles StephensAssistant General ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando International Airport
0	Check elsewhere. While nice looking on the outside and in the lobby the rooms leave much to be desired! Upon checking in we spent the next 15 minutes chasing and squishing black bugs around the floor. The mattress is very old and worn down, quite lumpy with the edges collapsing.
0	Overprized, overvalued. Good location, nice room, but that's it. No atmosphere, impersonal, not really interested front desk, chaotic and hilarious, above all poor and hardly any choice breakfast, a room with a view of an office building at 20 meter distance (privacy), room cleaned at 17.00 after our request, not a real clean room, found even 2 cockroaches on our bed when we went to sleep, no safe in the room. Just some of our disappointments. Relationship price quality, there is none with usd 689 2 nights! There are no doubt better options in Seattle skipp this one.
1	Easy check in, clean rooms. I checked in for one night over a July weekend and found the staff at the front desk to be very helpful. The clerk asked me where I'd prefer my room and I asked for somewhere quieter. She was able to put me in a room further away from the pool/stairs which was very great. The room was clean and smoke free as promised. The AC also worked very well. I would recommend earplugs if you go to bed early or want to sleep in, as other guests come back late and leave earlier for the near by attractions. During the night I couldn't hear anything from either neighboring room which was very nice!
0	Disappointing service. The hotel itself is fine but two times the housekeeping staff left our door open so when we came back after long days out we found the room wide open. The safe was not accessible so our passports and valuables were left unsecured. Having left the door open we would have thought they would have been in there replacing towels or making beds but neither of those things were done. We spoke with management and received an apology but we're not offered any compensation. Disappointing. Thank you for choosing Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel for your stay during Mardi Gras. I am sorry to hear that we didn't meet all of your expectations. Let me assure you that your issue will be addressed with our housekeeping staff. If you travel to New Orleans in the future, we would love to have another opportunity to meet your expectations.Thank You,Robert K. MOD
1	Perfect Location, Renovated, Quiet!. Spent two nights with my adult daughter and could not be more pleased. The room appeared to be recently renovated and finishes were good. Lovely full size tiled shower (no bath). Our room was on the U-shaped surround of the courtyard, which was lovely and full of greenery, a fountain, pool and several shaded tables.The breakfast was disappointing with low-end standard fare. But the service in all areas of the hotel was excellent. It's at the upper edge of the French Quarter and everything was easily walkable. The added bonus was the opportunity to see more of the lovely architecture. This is a great place to visit with a group of friends/family. The courtyard affords the opportunity to gather and socialize without everyone piling in a room or hanging in the lobby (both awkward options!). It's a very intimate feeling hotel.I am pleased to hear you enjoyed our hotel and staff.. I hope the next time you are in New Orleans you will come back and see us. Sincerely, Chastity
0	Will not stay again.. I visited this hotel about 6,7years ago, It was nice, not sure what happened now.I stayed in the family suite, it was horrible,, one of the bedrooms was so hot,it melted my hair products.. The stairwell smelled like urine and fish. The kitchen stove area was dirty, both restrooms were hot and grimmy.The front of the dresser drawers were falling... More
0	Outdated and dirty. This hotel was dirty and outdated. The staff was very nice but we will not stay at this hotel again. All of the furnishings have obvious wear and tear. Our floor had food crumbs. My husband had to go get the vacuum cleaner and vacuum the carpet. The sink had not been cleaned. The carpet was old, dirty and stained.
1	Nice place in downtown Chicago. A lot of the posted reviews are negative because of the smallness of the rooms. Ok people, the whole concept about boutique hotels are that they are small, unique with their usage of limited space and fairly reasonable because of it. If your principle concerns to have a large spacious luxury suite, than the Hilton millennium is down Michigan ave and will cost you at least 4 times the price. Then you can complain about the high cost of staying in Chicago. The Felix is located just 4 short blocks west of the Magnificent Mile and about a 15 minute stroll to the Navy Pier. The staff is very friendly and helpful. We arrived at just about noon and our room was ready. It was clean and fresh and the bed was very comfortable. There are numerous restaurants all around the facility and the area feels very safe. There is complimentary coffee and tea every morning and their is a small bar with limited times and services available.Overall we found our stay very comfortable and made our weekend in the Windy City a very enjoyable one.Hi Bolte59 - Thank you very much for posting your review. We are glad to hear that you enjoyed our urban location central to dining, shopping and more and that our helpful staff was able to assist you. Thank you again for your kind remarks feedback. We hope to see you again when you return to Chicago. Safe travels.
0	Business meeting. It was terrible i will never stay there again. Dirty, noisy, tv didnt work. The staff was a joke
0	Clean but noisy.. Clean hotel but the noise and vibrations from people walking outside to the bathroom fans in other rooms reverberated right through the bed. very poor insulation. Definitely not worth 140 a night. Napa city is highly over rated. If you are going for wine, then stay in the small towns up the valley like St Helena.Thank you for your review. I am sorry for any noise you encountered during your stay with us. I will look into the fan noise and get it replaced at once.
1	Great hotel! Superb staff!. We booked through hotels.com. When we got to the hotel, it seemed to be taking a long time for the manager, Angel Torres, to check us in. Turns out they were updating their fire code system and all the reservations for rooms with king size beds were being taken out of commission for any reservation that was longer than two nights. He tried to override the computer, but it seems computers are now running the world. He very politely inquired if we would mind a room with 2 beds. I couldn't really understand why anyone would really consider that a big deal, since now I had a bed to throw all my clothes on and another one to sleep in. Once he assured me that the room was the same size as the king I told him to go ahead and do it. He then proceeded to comp us the shuttle (which runs 22/day per room) for our entire stay, as well as giving us coupons for complimentary drinks at the hotel bar. I asked him to also give us free parking to which he responded that he had, the previous week, reversed their policy of charging for parking. I told him to make sure to put that on the website because that could be major deterrence for some people. What more could one ask for!! We definitely came out ahead and he was so apologetic about the whole thing. The room was huge, clean and comfortable. The pool is lovely, the FREE breakfast had a huge variety of items to choose from. No question we would definitely stay here again and will strongly recommend it to any friends who might choose Key West as their destination.Donna, the concierge was also great. Gave great recommendations and lots of coupons for stuff on Duval Street.Thank you for choosing the Fairfield Inn Suites at The Keys Collection for your recent travels to Key West. Commitment to service and guest satisfaction is a main focus and we are delighted to hear you enjoyed your stay.
0	Construction. Not great - Construction is important but changing the lobby is not the most important reason. Rooms are more important. I would skip this Hotel until the construction is finished. I was not impressed to stay here.
0	Business stay. Hotel is old, in need of updating - especially the carpet, heavily stained. The per night price was too much in comparison to the condition and service for the hotel.
0	worst experience ever. Never had such bad experience before. Stayed in this hotel for 9 nights, there were so many incidents happened during my stay.First night, I requested double room when I check in, they gave me three times twin room.And I asked for a room with the view, they said I have to pay 6USD extra, which I agreed, then I found it was much more than what I have been told. Second night, I was being locked outside of my room. After changing the key card three times, they found out that it was the lock issue,they asked me to wait in the lobby till midnight, and then arranged me a room next door,which was not even cleaned thoroughly. Yuk, imagine that sleeping at a room with someone else left belongings.Third day, I was being notified that the lock of my room was fixed, so I can move back to my own room, such a relief, I was wondering what I am gonna do if I couldnt get back to my room, since all my stuffs are there. So I took a quick shower before going back to my room. Guess what I have found out when I change back to my own room The door was left unlocked and nobody was there!!! I had to quick check if anything was missing. Just when I decided to relax a bit in my room, someone came in my room without even knocking my door. He left immediately when he saw I was in the room without saying a word. I went to ask what that was for, he told me he just want to confirm if I need room service. I think that makes sense, and I answered yes, I need. but why didnt he knock first I went out for sightseeing during the day, when I get back to the room, it was exact the same as I left, nobody came to clean it. So I called them to ask why they didnt do the housekeeping since they came to my room specifically to ask if I require room service, which I answered yes, in the morning. They did send someone over to do it though after that phone call.Fourth day, since I thought they just did the cleaning the late night before, I left my room with DND sign on the door. Guess what happened My room was cleaned!!! Whats more, I was locked in the elevator for nearly ten minutes that night, and I had to call for help.Fifth day, I found my credit card has been charged by the hotel with a strange amount of money. So I called them to ask why. The person who answered the phone said they will investigate and get back to me. I was waiting and waiting, still no answer, until I get back to the hotel at the night, I had to explain myself again with what happened to another their staff. Yet, still no answer.Sixth day, they charged my credit card again, which makes me so furious, since they just did whatever they want without asking for my permission. Seventh day, after I called four times, finally, they found the reason why my credit card has been charged.Because they didnt preauthrize enough money when I checked in, so they have to do it again and again. I said why it is different amount of money then, they couldnt give me a straight answer. And when I asked why they didnt inform me first Yet, no straight answer.Eighth night, I have been charged again, but I could guess what it was for already.The check out day was the most smooth day during my entire stay. I asked them to print my bill. And I am so glad that I did.To be fair, the location of this hotel is really nice, since it is just next to the Space Needle. The breakfast is too blunt. Strong smell of the decoration for not only the lobby, also the room. But the attitude of their staff is really good. And they are actually quite helpful. So I wasnt going to write my experience until today when I saw the final invoice I was being charged around 60USD for parking fee. Ironically, I dont even have a driving license, and I have never drove a car!!! This is soooooooo ridicules. I have stayed in many hotels in variety locations around the world, never suffered as badly as in this hotel. Worst experience ever and super disappointed.Dear mgx2222,Thank you so much for choosing to stay at Hyatt Place during your recent trip to Seattle. I would like to first and foremost apologize on behalf of the hotel and entire staff for the unsatisfactory experience you encounter during your recent visit. We really appreciate you taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor. I could make excuses about the newness of the hotel and the lack of experience of our staff, but that doesnt rectify your inconvenience. Its important for us to hear the feedback from our guests, as we want to improve and make the necessary changes that lead to positive experiences. We are addressing these concerns with the appropriate departments. We always want to be a part of great travel memories. Please let us know when you come back to Seattle as we would love to welcome you back!Sincerely, Sarah Junge
1	This hotel is a good choice for the Baltimore area. Our stay was nice. The hotel is located not too far away from Mayland live and the Mills mall. If you don't have transportation of your own (as we did not since we were visiting from out of state)the hotel does offer transportation within a 5 mile radius which includes the casino and the airport. The airport is priority for the hotel so if there is an airport trip or pick up, the airport will take priority over the casino or the mall. The casino and airport are not walkable even though you can see the casino from the hotel window as there are no sidewalks all the way. The breakfast is complimentary and is better then we have seen in most hotels. We do advise you to go before 7:30 for the breakfast as it gets crowded down there. The walls are very thin and you can hear the people on the other side of the wall if they are loud. The people on the other side of us were loud until close to 6AM when they finally went to sleep. Since I keep the same hours when I travel as to when I don't, this part was disturbing to me.
0	Pricey Crash Pad. Stayed at hotel for a football game nearby. Shower didn't drain. Shower curtain didn't stay on the shower curtain rod. Maid never remade the room. Not enough power outlets handy to recharge the cell phones of the group in my room. Continental breakfast was so lousy, we ate breakfast elsewhere. Elevator was out of order upon arrival (was fixed during our stay). In dire need of a renovation. If you can book it for the same price as Motel 6, then go for it, otherwise avoid until a renovation occurs.
1	Wonderful value, super friendly staff!. We had a great experience here. For the money, you can't beat Hampton Inn Mission Valley. The staff is very friendly and helpful, the complimentary breakfast is the best I've had (and I stay at many hotels), and the rooms are clean and modern. The temperature is easy to control, and there were extra blankets in the closet. We got daily housekeeping service and they did a great job. There is a pool and hot tub, as well as a fire pit. The pool is smaller than it appears in the picture, but it was never overly crowded and my sons had a blast playing in it every night. The town is a short Uber ride away. There are two washers and dryers for guest use, but sometimes there is a wait. I would definitely stay again.
1	Wonderful Beach stay. If its a beach stay in San Diego stay here. We reserved a partial view room with 2 queen beds( mum, dad and 2 girls 6/5) and wow they delivered. Our room was huge, bathroom a great size and a cute little balcony where we sat out and watched the sun set over the ocean. We were not over looking the pool which I was grateful as in the afternoon it was very busy.The hotel is located right on the boardwalk, and a few minute walk to the pier. It is surrounded by lots of bars and restaurants and only a short drive to Sea World ( 8 mins).Breakfast was included in the price too which included waffle maker, toaster, cereals, muffins, fresh fruit, juices and a coffee machine. There is a tv in the breakfast room which was nice to be to catch up on some news. After breakfast we had a short play at the beach before returning to the heated pool. At this hour ( 9.30 ) we were the only ones there. We met a very helpful young man who was placing the towels on the pool lounges. He was full of information about the local area.We really wish we could have stayed a few more days, we felt relaxed and at home at Ocean Park Inn , we will be back for sureIt sounds like you had a wonderful vacation! Our location is quite ideal for families, as we are very centrally located in both Pacific Beach and greater San Diego - great for easy drives to SeaWorld, San Diego Zoo, Safari Park, and Legoland! We're happy you took advantage of our complimentary amenities, and thank you for taking the time to write such a wonderful review.
1	Excellent Service for Couples with Baby. Without a doubt this hotel is beautiful, immaculate and the staff is very courteous. I would expect no less of a hotel of this caliber. What blew me away was their friendliness and hospitality toward our one year old baby boy. When they found out we were traveling with a baby we were placed in a beautiful corner room with a separate area for our son to sleep. Anyone traveling with babies will understand how valuable this is! You can hear the traffic noise on the street below but we traveled with a white noise machine that blocked the noise. We requested a travel crib and they delivered the crib already assembled with extra towels and wash cloths and a set of travel size Johnson and Johnson bath products. These little touches made this mama's heart so happy! I would give more than 5 stars if possible.
0	Poor service, Needs cleaning. My daughter and I stayed for one night. I checked in around 8:00 PM and no one was at the desk and there was no bell or any other way to notify staff we were waiting. After a short wait someone came in from a side office area and checked us in, but made no acknowledgement that we were waiting. Shortly after we got to the room I picked up the remote to turn on the TV and found the back cover for the batteries was missing. I pressed the power button on the remote and the TV did not turn on, thinking that because the cover was missing it was the batteries. I removed the batteries and put them back in but that did not work. I then tried to turn on the TV directly and still no power. After tracing the power cable I found that it was unplugged. The power cable would not reach the wall outlet so I plugged it in to the desk lamp on the counter next to the TV. Later that night I saw what looked like a roach crawling on the wall in the bathroom. The bathroom was the size of a small closet where the door had just enough clearance to open before hitting bathtub. There was maybe 3X4 floor space in the bathroom itself. The bed was extremely soft.
0	Bugs bugs bugs. Tub also leaked from wall pipe and staff blamed us for the damage nothing but crack heads living there and drug busts all night you would like to meet a Polk county sheriff's stay here then there there most nights
0	Beware-- Won't Honor Advertised Specials, Bait and Switch Rates!. I wish I had the opportunity to rate my experience at this hotel, but I never got the chance to even book my reservation.I had done a lot of resarch on hotels for my upcoming visit to San Francisco in two months, and was very pleased to find the Orchard Garden Hotel. When I did more research, I discovered in the specials section of their website that they offer a discounted rate of 149 for a superior king room when you book three consecutive nights (San Francisco Triple Play special valid through 8/31). When I clicked on this special and attempted to book my stay, however, it only offered me the room at the regular rate of 213 a night, 64 more a night!Assuming this was just an error with the website, I called the reservations desk. They couldn't explain why I couldn't book at that rate either so they transferred me directly to the hotel. The hotel staff politely explained that this rate has blackouts, and that I must have been trying to book during the blackout. The special didn't mention blackouts, and I pointed this out. The special is worded plainly and said that if space was available, the offer was valid through 8/31. No fine print, etc.- I was very careful to pay attention.Long story short, they admitted that this is used to entice customers during times of low vacancy and that the rate is only available arbitrarily, i.e., there may only be one room available at this rate on a particular date. I'm upset because it is extremely deceptive to say that a promotion is available until a certain date if space is available (which it was), and then not honor it. I asked if they would honor their special, but they said that they weren't willing to and that the higher, regular rate is the best they could do. Bottom line is that they advertise specials to interest you, then try to charge way more. As a result, I'll go elsewhere...don't waste your time trying to use one of their specials or discounts. I'm very disappointed.
1	Great location and good service. We stayed here for 9 days for vacation purposes, so we experienced pretty much everything this hotel has to offer.It's location is great. It is right in front of Lake Union. Ask for a room looking towards the lake (floors 5 or higher): you will be rewarded with beautiful sunrises and sunsets. You will also see people kayaking and swimming. And Kenmore Air departs for its water seeing tours from there, so you can see plane lift ups and water landings: cool!As though that was not enough, you are 1 mile away from Seattle Center (Space Needle, EMP Museum, Chihuli Gardens, etc).We had a car, so it was nice to find plenty of parking, even for SUVs. Unfortunately you will be charges 27/day.Rooms are very comfortable. The staff (all of it: reception, restaurant, housekeeping) makes a point of acknowledging customers in one way or another every time they see you. And Whenever you request something they deliver it rather quickly, regardless of the hour. The hotel has a swimming pool and a hot tub. Small both of them, but good enough.The restaurant is open for breakfast and dinner only. No complaints on the service: very good. Breakfast offerings are fine: from healthy choices (oatmeal, yogurt with granola, fruits, etc) to more elaborate ones. Variety is limited but decent and it is all prepared rather fast. Dinner options were not attractive to us. We found them a bit over priced for the quality and quantity. However, the hotel has a small market where you can find a few things to eat, assuming you do not want to go out for dinner.A few blocks away from the hotel there is a Starbucks and a McCormick Schmick's restaurant, both of them with waterfront viewing. And about 5 blocks away there is a Bartell drugs where you can find medicines, regular snacks and a few more sophisticated options (salads, Gouda cheese, prosciutto and good crackers, etc).All in all: great place to stay. I highly recommend it.
1	Excellent location. The hotel has an excellent location, close to several tourist attractions such as Millennium Park and The Art Institute of Chicago. The staff is really friendly! We got a check in two hours in advance.Bedroom is clean and has a good size. We asked for an extra bed and it was put in the bedroom quickly. The restroom is also good. Not fancy but comfortable and clean.There's no breakfast included, which is not a good point, but there are several restaurants nearby (Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts and others). The hotel is also close to several train stations.Wifi works well in the bedroom. The fees are not so cheap, but for that location all hotels use to be expensive, so I'd say this one offers a good cost-benefit ratio.In general it was a good experience and I'd stay there again in the future.Dear Camila LThank you very much for the review of your recent stay with us at The Central Loop HotelI am delighted that we were able to offer you good value for money and you were able to enjoy all the amenities that we offer and appreciated our great location from which to get out and see the city.I was especially delighted to read about the service we offered you - we know that these small things make all the difference. We hope we can look after you again very soon.Kind regardsPaul Tiernan - Hotel Manager
1	On Fishermans Wharf and centrally located for restaurants and sightseeing. Excellent location and clean hotel located within walking distance to sightseeing and Boudins and Aliotos. Cute hotel with parking and relatively safe. Rooms were clean and good maid service. Good location for families as everything is walking distance and many shops and restaurants within one block of hotel. Newly remodeled and very hip for families and young at heart. Would stay here again and would recommend it to others.Hi ukhane,Thank you very much for writing about your experience at Zephyr!Ukhane, I am thrilled to hear you say words like hip and young at heart! Yes, that is us!! From our spectacular yard with its fire pits, life size Jenga, connect 4, round ping pong table and our awesome periscope!! to our game room with its great TV's, pool and shuffle board, everything calls for fun here at Zephyr!!As we say, play like no one is watching!! just have some fun!Ukhane, my Z-team and I hope to see you back soon!Warmest regards,Carmen CruzGeneral Manager
0	Bugs. Checked out a day and a half early due to bed bugs. No other vacancies there, but I don't think I would accept another room there anyway.
1	As usual number one place to stay. As usual number one place to stay. Love the friendly staff for the most part did have one cranky one in the drink part. Breakfast and dinner was good. Recommend Room 221. Where around the corner under the Corredor there is the elevator that takes it down to the lunch room And to the rooftop pool. Prices are comparable to the local area. Fridge and coffee in the room. About five blocks from Canel Street and into the French quarters. Walking distance which we did. But there is also a street car service available right outside of the corner lot
0	Won't stay again. Room very old and many things wrong. Toilet didn't flush properly, stains on carpet and sun out drapes, fixtures broken, dust and mildew mold in bathroom. Front desk staff refused to change rooms and would not acknowledge complaint. Booked 1 king room 3 months in advance, but got 2 doubles. Many issues, so we would never return. Good area and good price though. On behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you gave us to implement improvements to ensure we offer a better experience for guests in the future. Your reservation came directly from Best Western for 2 queens.We were not able to move you to a different room due to us being sold out. We will have maintenance repair or replace the toilet and the light fixtures also.
0	Dangerous, dark, and filthy. I booked a room at the Ramada Limited Downtown San Francisco for 4 nights (19-23 May 2007) six months in advance at a room rate of 113 per night plus tax. The advertisement stated that there was free continental breakfast, free wireless internet in the rooms, refurbished large rooms, free coffee makers, etc. Despite having booked well in advance I did not get a room in the hotel but rather in the annex and at the same room rate. The annex was across the street and partway down the block and this was not at all like what was advertised.1 There were no elevators. I had to carry my bags up several fights of stairs to get to the room.2 The room was tiny (9 x 13 feet) and had only a single twin bed. My confirmation was for a queen-sized bed.3 The room was dark because the light bulbs had been removed from the lamps and the overhead light was dim. The carpet was filthy, so perhaps this was deliberate.4 There was no internet access. There might have been access if you walked back across the street and down the block to the main building and then stood in the lobby but I did not try this,5 The continental breakfast was only available to guests in the main building according to Samir, the desk clerk.6 There was no coffee or coffee maker.7 There was no bathtub - only a small shower stall. In any case, it would be ill advised to take a shower because only two thin hand towels were provided for guests making it impossible to dry off.8 The air conditioner was broken. It was running but not cooling and all of the knobs had been removed so it was impossible to adjust any settings. Perhaps for this reason, the room had a foul odor.I returned to the main building, it was now about 3.30 PM, and I asked Samir for a different room - similar to what was advertised when I booked the room. He told me this was impossible. I then told him that I would not be using the room and I would find other accommodations and he told me that my credit card would still be billed the full amount because I had already checked in. I returned to my room down the street and I called Ramada customer service telephone support and a nice fellow named Jason (I believe) agreed that this was a problem but he said that all Ramada properties are independently owned and thus he could do nothing for me. He gave me the name of the manager of this property and suggested that I keep trying to contact him directly.I packed an overnight bag and left my luggage in the room as I did not want to haul it down the stairs and around the city looking for another room and I was going to be charged for the room anyway. I stayed in the Marriott that night and retuned the next day to check out of the Ramada. At the desk was the acting manager, Bobbie, who explained that the manager, Mr. Monday, was in Indonesia. Bobbie had not been told anything about my problem but he quickly found me an acceptable room in the main building and helped me move my bags so I completed my stay at the Ramada. In compensation for my problems and having to take a room at the Marriott the first night he took 12.90 (!) off my total bill of 515.76 (not very impressive).I am extremely dissatisfied by this affair. The property is not as advertised and the price is far in excess for similar rooms in the city. Indeed, the room I was given in the annex was dangerous and uninhabitable. The Ramada staff at the hotel were unwilling to help until I was about to leave early, the telephone support from Ramada was unable to help resolve this problem.
0	Fire Alarm. Nice looking hotel, nice rooms and amenities, Not as good as other drury hotels i have stayed at, the food wasnt great, and drinks were very watered down. and one night i was loudly awakened at 1.30am from the fire alarm, had to rush down the steps 7 floors, stand outside for 15 mins for someone to tell us the front desk staff hit the wrong button, not acceptable.Thank you for your recent stay, and please accept my apologies for the fire alarm. As you know, the timing was awful, but the issue has been repaired. I hope you will give us another chance next time your travels bring you back to New Orleans!Sincerely,Patrick D.GM, DIS-NWO
0	Good location but small rooms for family. Hotel outdoor pool looked much larger on the website and appeared to be oceanfront. The rooms were somewhat smaller and from the orbitz website it looked like the room would be separated into 2 areas - 1 bedroom 1 TV/dining area w/couch. Apparently those rooms are only available across the street from the ocean.
1	Great room for the money. Not only myself, but my family loved this hotel and we will return again. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants good service as well as a nice, clean hotel stay:) The rooms were excellent and very comfortable. The breakfast buffet was awesome and I loved the pool/jaccuzi and computer room. Onsite laundry is recommended as well as the room service. Great location as there were many restaurants nearby. If I could change anything, it would be the structure of the hotel room (to include more privacy for a family of four...door or divider). Best hotel I've stayed at in a very long time!

1	Excellent Hotel, Friendly staff and great location. Abraham, Maryann and Serge were excellent in their service, went above expectations.Room was clean and quiet, pool is large with soothing waterfall, breakfast and location was exceptional. Will stay at The Saint on future visits.Roger and PatI was really great having you guys, it was like having family with us. I shared your review, Serge and Marianne wanted to say hi and thank you. I hope you have already started thinking about your next trip to Key West, because we are looking forward to your next visit. Thank you for all the kind words.
0	Property Needs cleaning and maintenance. Front desk reception staff very welcoming. Lobby comfortable and inviting . Room was dark and damp . Bathroom had mold in corners, needs a good scrubbing with bleach. Laminate floor needs cleaning, it was scuff marked and had nail polish drops on it. Breakfast bad, dried out biscuits ,no jam or peanut butter for toast, no yogurt.
1	Great location, comfortable rooms. You can walk to Arlington Cemetary the Iwo Jima Memorial from the hotel, as well as to a supermarket restaurants. The hotel shuttle was very reliable, running in the morning afternoon Mon-Fri to from the Metro station once a day to the supermarket. The suites were large, with a pull-out sofa in every room. It wasn't the most comfortable, but it was great to have a separate bedroom area full kitchen. The only thing I was suprised at was the fact that we had to lift our heavy luggage up about 5 steps to get to the elevators. There were no ramps. From the parking lot, it's a straight shot through the front doors of the main entrance. I saw some people arrive by bus, which dropped them off on a side street. They were dragging their luggage up about 30 stairs to get to the parking lot! Instead, they could've just walked around along the street in front of the hotel to get to the lot. Going up all those stairs with luggage did not look fun!
0	Gross!. The other review was obviously written by one of the owners. Grossest room I have ever been in. Only good thing I can say is they were nice enough to refund my mY money so I could go somewhere else. I am writing this from the Super 8 few blocks away and I can still smell the stench of the...

I left this holding fee then only on check... More
0	Very bad customer service. We were supposed to stay here on September 30, 2012, but we had to change our plans. I canceled the reservation on August 20th and got a confirmation email about the confirmation. I was well within the 72 hour cancellation time period so that I would not be charged as a no show. I found out a couple of days ago that they charged my card anyway. I forwarded the confirmation email to them and asked them why they charged me, the general manager wrote back that he did the research, and because the reservation was never cancelled on their end, it wasn't considered cancelled, and I was being charged as a no show. He did, however offer me a credit towards a one night stay if I come to Napa in the next two years, which I won't. Needless to say, I'm disputing the charge with my bank.
1	*wonderful place*. hello! i am a mother of a 19month old boy and me and my husband are both nurses with very stressful job demands and this place was very relaxing for us. we stayed from may 6,2012 up to may 11, 2012 and my heart was broken when we left. i am very picky in regards to finding a perfect place for us wherein both me and my husband can relax and my son can have fun as well.. this place is perfect! they gave us what we wanted, a room with an ocean front balcony with fully working microwave and fridge, we couldn't ask for more! the staff were really nice and accommodating, and the place is very clean..I did enjoy my morning walks along the beach and people are very friendly as they walk by as well. the place is near sea world which is very convenient also near garnett st where there was a lot of restaurants you can eat.. we would definitely recommend this place to our family and friends and we'll surely be back for a longer stay next year!!!We're thrilled to hear you found and enjoyed the perfect place to unwind on your vacation with your family! Many of our regular guests bring their families back to our property year after year, and it's always a pleasure to see the kids growing up. One year we're handing out a bucket and shovel to play in the sand, then before we know it we're handing out boogie boards and describing the best spots to catch waves to the same child! Thank you for all the wonderful compliments - we can't wait to see you and the family again!
0	I'm Platinum and I'm saying NEVER. I have stayed at a ton of Marriotts and know how they are supposed to work. This property is close to the airport in Chicago, but I will NOT consider staying at this hotel in the future. I found the front desk to be extremely rude. While the hotel itself is okay, there are a number of other properties in this general location happy to help with simple requests and appreciative of your loyalty.Dear Brad945,Thank you for being a valued Platinum Elite Member. Marriott is proud to have over 35 million members worldwide. We know our elite members are out there traveling more than 75 room nights per year so thank you for your loyalty. Our goal is to not only meet, but exceed your expectations so you may continue to travel brilliantly. I apologize we fell short on making you feel valued and for not going the extra mile to ensure all those little details were in place. I hope you give us another opportunity to regain your loyalty. I ask that you reach out to me when you arrive, so I may personally welcome you back!Wishing you safe travels,
0	CAME THROUGH IN A PINCH, BUT BRING OUR OWN PILLOW!. They were able to accommodate me at an earlier time than normal check-in. Room was clean and comfortable except for the pillows. Also, there were no bathroom amenities other than shampoo. The town was flooding and under a STATE OF EMERGENCY. The staff was scrambling to accommodate guests as best they could.
0	Pay the extra for a nicer motel. Booked a night here through hotels.com Cost 167. Saved between 30 and 40 off the hotel website.The hotel is very small, the room was stuck in the 80s, the elevator was covered in graffiti and it was faster to take the stairs.It was noisy in the room. We could hear people in the other rooms and the wi-fi kicked uis out everytime we turned off our ipads. It would not allow our phones to log in.I was not comfortable letting my children leave the room at all without a parent even into the outdoor hallway which is accessible to anybody, including non hotel guests.The parking lot is so small all cars were doubled parked. The front desk does keep the keys of people double parked to let you out though.This was the worst breakfast of our 2 week trip. Cold donuts and muffins with tea or coffee (no milk or cream, just dried cream substitute).I would recommend some place that cost 50 more that has a better breakfast, more secure rooms and better parking.The only positive thing from this stay was the two people working the front desk were both very polite and helpful at finding things in San Francisco.
0	Worst hotel - not honest. We drove down to AC for a night and called The Chelsea. They never explained the difference between their Annex and main hotel. We didn't know we were staying in the Annex until we checked in. It was disgusting, loud, and felt unsafe. The hotel room doors slammed shut all night long and it was loud until 3:30 am. For 350/night you expect a much cleaner, well-maintained and professional environment. Management did not even contact us about our experience after leaving a comment card about the condition of the room, which leads you to believe they either don't care or have heard it all before. Also, you can forget about using the roof top deck that they pump up so much on their website. They try and charge you 30/person to get in, up sell you with bottle service when the environment is so scummy and gross. For every Jersey Shore Meathead present, there is a security guard covered in tattoos. It's just a weird, unsafe and uneventful scene.
0	AVOID THIS PLACE. This is the most unprofessional extended stay property. It is very old and outdated. The associates are not well trained, and there never seems to be a manager on duty available. The check in process takes forever, the front desk staff was not trained properly on online reservation codes. The rooms smelled terrible. Do not fall in the lowest rate possible trap. Even with a low rate, you don't get what you pay for. AVOIDI received a copy of your review, and wanted to take a moment to personally respond. Please accept our most sincere apologies for all the problems you encountered during your stay. Your comments were reviewed by the staff, and we will holding daily team meetings to make sure your experience is not repeated. We continually work to improve our hotel, so I really appreciate you providing us with your feedback. If you have any additional feedback, please reach out to me at dmcextendedstay.com. We do hope you will choose to stay with us again so we can have the opportunity to provide you with a better experience.
1	DC trip experience - I would do it again. This hotel is a great stay if you're looking to go into DC. Me and my friend went down at the end of Aug 2010. Although we had to change rooms two times, overall, the experience was good. The first room had the smell of urine so we asked to change. The second room had a roach in it so again we asked to change. We weren't taking any chances because if there is one roach there may be more. Finally, the third room was great. The hotel was conveniently located near the train station, mall, and diner. The hotel shuttle was great also. There were many options during breakfast. We received small gifts from the hotel during our stay such as goody bags and treats. It was really nice to come back after being away from the hotel and find something special left in the room. That was nice. The outside of the hotel was really beautiful. I really enjoyed my experience and think that I would stay there again.
0	Mixed. The hotel was clean, and in good repair for the most part. The internet was sketchy, and did not work for the first night. The availability of wireless being the reason I choose this hotel, this was quite bothersome. It is kind of a ride to DC, though not terrible. The shuttle service picking us up from the train was late despite numerous calls. Some of the customer service was better than others, just depends who you talk to. The surrounding area leaves something to be desired. In the end, it was not terrible, but it was not great either.
1	Recommended. Comfortable, quiet, friendly staff. The lobby is amazing and a great place to meet for drinks. The room I had was small, but functional. Elevators were always available.Overall, this is a nice gem in downtown Philadelphia close to City Hall and restaurants. I highly recommend it.Todd,Being a part of the opening team, I have said from day one, even during construction, that our lobby would be the most beautiful and exciting in the city. It is always great to hear that our guests such as yourself feel the same! Our team is always working hard to ensure that you have a quiet and relaxing stay, and I am glad that you felt we were successful in that attempt. I hope we see you again soon!Best,Andrew DrydenAssistant General Manager
1	Friendly Hotel in a Great Location. For the price, location, comfort, and friendly staff, you can't beat the Orchard Garden Hotel. The location is in a safe and central location -- we walked to Union Square, SFMOMA, Chinatown, and the wharf. The room was a little small, but quiet and had everything we needed. The staff was always friendly and helpful. Would recommend and stay again!Deborah, you really go those steps in walking around the city! It's our pleasure to make sure our guests have everything they need and more. We can't wait to have you back for your next trip.Until next time,Pablo B. General Manager
0	It needs some major remodel. Not particularly clean. Bathrooms very small with small toilets. Front desk clerk very polite. no elevators. Breakfast was decent. No elevators. Repairs needed.
1	Great spot in PB.... Ocean Park Inn is in a great location in Pacific Beach, with plenty to do in the immediate area. It seems to be one of the few hotels right on the beach, and it was just a few steps from our room to the sand. Its a very clean hotel, and the staff is very attentive and friendly. We definitely plan on being back.Thanks for leaving such a nice review! We are happy to hear you enjoyed your stay with us and all of our amenities and found our staff members helpful and resourceful. We hope to have you back soon! Thanks for staying at the Ocean Park Inn.
1	Perfect location. The location of the hotel is absolutely unbeatable. You'll be on Union Square within 3-5 minutes of walking distance. The front desk staff was so nice and we had nice little chats with them. The only thing I was a bit disappointed about, was the size (or lack of) of the room. We traveled with 2 big suitcases and struggled to find space for them. However if you are just staying for 2-3 nights on a city trip, this hotel is ideal and I would definitely stay again.Hi Celina93,Thank you so much for the positive review! We are glad to read that you enjoyed your stay with us. Perhaps next time we can book a larger room for you. Please let us know if we can be of any assistance in planning for your next trip to San Francisco. We look forward to seeing you soon!Warm Regards,Dana AndrewsGuest Relations
0	Poor layout and maintenance. Picked this hotel because it was advertised as the host hotel for a dog show/obedience trial. Since dogs have to be taken out regularly, attendees of course wanted rooms on the ground floor. Management assigned a block of rooms where everyone had to go either up or down stairs to get outside. Keep in mind, most of these people are... More
1	Parking. The hotel is ok but considering you pay 19 a day for parking it should be better. There aren't many normal parking spots. You frequently end up in a parking structure in the back and walking stairs to reach your car. Breakfast is as expected at any similar property. Very busy on the weekend. And no matter how busy it is at 10am the doors will be locked. We were done but several people missed out. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Housekeeping pounded on our door and brought us towels at night we didn't ask for and when we told the front desk they acted like it was our fault for not refusing the towels.
1	Only spent one night but very comfortable. I have yet to stay at a Hilton Garden Inn that wasn't exactly what I wanted - a comfortable bed, a clean room and good sleep. We flew in late to Orlando and stayed here before continuing on the next day. The room was clean and comfortable and we had a good solid sleep to start our vacation.Rhonda, thanks so much for posting your wonderful feedback. We are so happy to know you enjoyed the comfort of your room and that your stay was satisfactory. It was a pleasure hosting you at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport, and we hope you will come and see us again soon.Sincerely,Michael GoldwasserGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport
0	Not worth your money or time. I lived in San Diego for a time and wanted to stay downtown for a night. I booked this place because it was the cheapest near downtown. Location was good, but that was it. It was massively overpriced for what I got! Lobby being redone-it's a mess getting anywhere. Room is small and dated. It was clean and quiet though. Breakfast did not taste very good and was in a separate restaurant. I didn't even bother with the pool since it was in the middle of the building, didn't get any sun, extremely small, and right next to the makeshift lobby so every hotel patron could see you.I will spend a little more money next time to stay in a better location and better hotel.Thank you for taking time to review your stay with us at Best Western Plus Bayside Inn during your trip to San Diego. We are thankful for your feedback about our pool and your breakfast experience. Please accept our sincere apologies for any discomfort you experienced during our lobby remodel. We hope to have the opportunity to accommodate you in the future and we invite you to contact the management at the hotel directly should you consider staying with us again or if you would like to provide more details about your stay. Best Regards,Grace GerzenSales Manager
0	Not good!. Stayed here for a night. It is in poor condition and needs a lot of work. The place was quiet and I felt safe. But, it was not very nice. I would not recommend this place. There are far better places to stay in Ashland.
0	Not a very professional front desk staff!. I have stayed at the Holiday Inn Twice! Both times we had problems with the rooms. The first time it was the room that was dirty (used condoms on the floor, found by my grandchildren) they did not come in to clean the room until 10:30pm.On July 3,2011 I also reserved 2 adjoining rooms. The outside of the Hotel was a mess. The plants and trees were all dead. The inside was being remolded and was okay. They workers kept it nice and clean. The girls at the front desk did not seem to know what they were doing! It took two of them to figure where we were supposed to stay and how to charge us. I ended up getting overcharged for the rooms and to make matters worse I was double charged. When I called them, I left a message for the someone to call me back. They said it would be in a half hour. Well one and a half hours later I had to call. They would not put me through to the manager. They even hung up on me. Mind you I was not that upset at that time. I just wwanted to get someone to take care of the problem without me having to tell 5 people. Give me the right one the first time. I finally got the desk manager and she wanted to call me back, I told her no I would not take that chance. She said she would look it up and call me back. Now I am waiting for her call. Wish me luck!Now mind you the hotel was being remodeled and that was fine. But the pool area was dirty! There were glasses on all of the tables and towels laying around. (actually we should pick up after ourselfs). the water was not clean and not clear. We did take our towels out of the rooms with us and took them back in. We asked the desk for clean ones and we got them right away brought to our room. It was 1:p.m. when we were in the pool. this Holiday Inn is the olny hotel close to my brothers house. But believe me next time will stay somewhere esle. I might have to drive further but maybe I will have a better stay!
1	MAGNIFICENT ATTENTION TO DETAIL. We hadn't visited the St. Regis Hotel in New York before, and I'll admit to having been a little wary. There are certain Grande Dame hotels in the Starwood portfolio that are a little past their shelf life, and looking a bit beaten up and in need of TLC. Not so the incredibly beautiful and fastidiously maintained St. Regis New York. This is a hotel that literally glistens with fresh paint, fresh scrubbing, fresh upholstery, sparkling crystal, and obsessive attention paid to every detail down to the weight of the stationery and the bulbs in the light fixtures. The desk staff was immediately friendly and accommodating. We asked for an SPG upgrade and were prepared for the usual few added square feet or better view. What we were given was the Fifth Avenue Suite, a truly grand and beautiful collection of rooms, palatial by Manhattan apartment standards, with a view of Fifth Avenue below. Like the rest of the hotel, the room was spotless, freshly refurbished, and offered two bathrooms, a generous walk-in closet, a fridge, and a host of creature comforts. Couldn't have asked for better.The Concierge staff were on their game and steered us to some terrific smaller restaurants we hadn't visited before. Every phone call to room service, the front desk, and housekeeping was met with a thoughtful, friendly, and always helpful voice at the other end. This is one of those hotels that reflects well on its demanding management and training standards, and every employee we met was professional and incredibly helpful and friendly. And every last one seemed aware and proud of the hotel's origins, history, and ambition to be the best at what it does.Minor gripes: Certain rooms in the hotel offer Butler Service, a tradition and pride of the St. Regis since its opening in 1904. We found the service a little awkward to use. When you phone the Butler, you hear a tone then a shrill whistle on the phone similar to reaching a fax machine. We weren't sure what this was about, so we phoned the hotel operator who said this was the paging system for the butlers, but she'd make sure our request for coffee service got through. A short while later, the Butler did arrive with coffee, and was very helpful with a few other requests. But we're not sure he'd have shown if not for the operator, because the next day we put in two calls, and after waiting for over an hour for any response, we just gave up and used other services. We also found, that for a hotel that paid such attention to detail in other areas, the door staff was not its strong suit. At great hotels, the doormen are part of the guest's first impression, with a greeting, an opened door, and an offer of help. The staff, at least on our visit, were often sort of just standing around, in one case watching us lug a heavy bag up the stairs before finally offering some help with the second. No one greeted us or opened a door on our several trips in and out, and we were just a little surprised at this minor lapse in an otherwise fantastic experience.The King Cole bar is cozy, classically New York, and historic-feeling. The Astor Court restaurant is beautiful and relaxed the food a little hit-and-miss. Likewise, the Private Dining options vary from delicious to just okay. Again, these are relatively minor complaints and smallish pieces of what was, overall, perhaps the best hotel experience we've had in the U.S. or Europe. Congratulations to everyone at the St. Regis for maintaining this fantastic and important heritage property.Dear twinlions, We are very pleased to learn that so many associates provided you with exceptional service during your recent visit to The St. Regis New York.Thank you for your time, and for recognizing our mission to provide the best service and pampering experience to each of our guests. Also, thank you for the constructive feed-back regarding front service and butlers. Rest assured, it will be addressed. We will share your kind words with our teams and we are so grateful for your support!We hope that we will have the opportunity of having you as our guest very soon!Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager
1	Beautiful Hotel. What a beautiful Hampton Inn in Napa. Great Location within walking distance of a movie theatre, gym, a few restaurants and Starbucks. The rooms are a nice size. The beds were comfy. They had DirecTv which is always a huge Plus! But the bathroom was awesome. Love, love, love the extra lighting and shelving for us ladies. The only thing I would add would be a wall magnifying mirror like the Marriott has. Even with all the amazing light it was hard to get up close to the mirror to do my makeup because of the size of the nice vanity.
0	NOT, NOT, NOT ADA Compliant. Booked through Kayak, double room, handicap accessible. Called before booking and spoke to front desk staff - they confirmed they had a wheelchair accessible double room. Upon arrival, they couldn't find our reservation - even with the booking number. Front desk clerk was visibly impaired, laughing inappropriately and giving two different names. Handicapped room was downstairs, no elevator! Clerk found... More
1	San Diego Vacation. Our family traveled to San Diego for a family wedding, we all stayed at the Ocean Park Inn. Overall it was a nice place to stay, rooms were clean and it was conveniently located right by the ocean. Enjoyed walking down the boardwalk every morning and the complimentary breakfast was nice too. Restaurants pubs were in walking distance to the hotel, so that made it nice for a quick bite to eat. We are so glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us at the Ocean Park Inn. Thank you for your wonderful feedback on the amenities that we offer, We do hope to welcome you back the next time you visit San Diego!
1	Hilton Garden Inn, Orlando Airport. This Hilton Garden Inn was comfortable. Other than the smell of some type of cleaner they used which wasn't that pleasant, the overall experience was very very good. Excellent service, friendly employees, excellent breakfast bar. They had a large container of fresh lemonade in the lobby that was some of the best I have tasted. There is so much tourism in Orlando, that I have found that it is hard to find an excellent hotel while staying down in the affordable rates, however this Hilton Garden Inn ranks high on the list of suitable Orlando hotels.Dear Guest Vandorn R, I would like to thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to write about your experience during your stay at the Hilton Garden inn Orlando Airport. We are constantly monitoring the performance of our team member to make sure our valuable guests as yourself is welcome with an efficient and pleasant front desk procedure that provides the accommodations and service you expect. We want our guests to be met with a well-trained staff that puts guest comfort and satisfaction before everything else. We are looking forward to welcome you, friends and family members to once again provide you with an outstanding level of service and nothing less. Sincerely,Alex BlancoGeneral Manager
1	Simply one of the best in Atlanta. My wife and I spent two nights at this gorgeous hotel recently while visiting Atlanta for a Braves game and, of course, for shopping (you can walk indoors to huge Lenox Square from this hotel). Our room was immaculate and beautifully furnished and equipped, but the thing that really stood out was the staff. Every single employee we encountered was friendly and helpful, and seemed determined to help us have a terrific stay. We will definitely be back.Thank you for recognizing our staff for their service during your recent stay. I am blessed to have so many dedicated associates that love providing outstanding service to our guests. I'm glad to hear that you were able to get to a Braves game and do some shopping in the Lenox Mall which is connected to our hotel. It's a great way to spend a few days while in Atlanta. We look forward to having you return again soon.
0	Full of Bed Bugs, Don't Go. My family and I went to Nashville for a vacation which was almost ruined by the condition of the rooms at the Days Inn North hotel. We were there for a total of four nights, and on the second night, I was attacked by bed bugs. I received over thirty bites! The pain is unbearable and I would not wish... More
1	Friendly staff saved the day. We stayed in this hotel with my father, who was coming to SF for a medical appointment. I booked the room online for 2, no charge in advance. It was very hectic and stressful trip for us, so appreciated very friendly and helpful staff. When we were checking in we couldnt get the CC thru, they let us stay with a promise we would take care of it next afternoon after we get off the hospital. We had a booking for 2 days, but we decided to go home after first night since we were alreaady done with our business in SF, they didnt even charge us cancelling fee. The room was ok, I would say it is perfect for people who only need a place to crash out- cant beat it for the price and location.Come on guys, you are in SF there are homeless people EVERYWHERE
1	Fun, Clean, Unique Hotel but Bathroom Needs Attention. This hotel provided a stimulated experience with the abundance of local art on display. Pool was wonderful despite the shallow depth (4 feet). I was also amazed at how quiet it was given all of the negative review I read prior concerning noise levels. Hotel is immaculate, surrounded by nice eateries, coffee shops, and bars. Staff were friendly and accommodating. Overall, I had a great time. I like the new artsy vibe in downtown AZ. The only issues we experienced were 1) Bathroom sink kept clogging at night. 2) There are no hooks in the bathroom to hang towels (this we found quite annoying and odd).Thank you for taking the time to write a review. We're bummed we missed the mark in a couple of areas. Our engineering team has actually been going floor by floor to install the bathroom hooks over the past week and are still working on them. Hopefully, next time you visit you'll have them to use. As far as the bathroom sink, we will certainly have someone fix it!
1	Gorgeous grounds, exceptional service. ServiceThe moment we pulled onto the drive of the Estancia, we were greeted in the most welcoming manner by the friendly valet. This set the bar high which every single employee met for our entire two evening stay. This is so rare but when I mean every single employee, I mean it! From housekeeping to front desk to restaurant servers to even the gardeners!SpaThe spa is great with especially lovely out door hot tub areas. My prenatal massage was great 9i dozed!) and my husband, who was apprehensive at first because he's only experienced a few of them, came out super relaxed and happy.PoolThe pool area is nice and saline water a major plus.FoodThe food was fine -- not exceptional like the service. We ate at Adobe and Mustangs and had room service. The one standout dish was a shrimp quesadilla appetizer from Mustangs - so delicious. Everything was was fine - seemed like standard hotel-y food.RoomOur room was nice but not luxurious - thin and surprisingly spartan walls. We had a veranda room which is a bit misleading. The veranda is just the landing area outside the door with a table and chair. It did open up to a very pretty grassy courtyard.LocationSituated in beautiful La Jolla in walking distance to the beach. We walked over to the glider launch area and down an amazing hike to Black's Beach! It's very steep and not for the faint of heart. The beach is popular in the nudist community so fair warning!Biggest ComplaintExtremely challenging to navigate the property. There did not seem to be an obvious simple or quick way to get to the pool/spa area and our parking spot. The different levels was confusing too. We ran into at least two other guests who were wandering around lost and trying to study the little property map at the same time. I think we even walked the perimeter through the parking lot once because it was just easier than trying to find our way through all the corridors. Recommend MORE DIRECTIONAL SIGNAGE. Maybe with accompanying maps that show context of where the guest is in relation to everything else like you are here arrow.All in all, I would definitely book this place and spa again. So relaxing -- wonderful getaway.Thank you for your review! We apologize if the property is confusing with 6 acres of land we can understand your frustration! We do, however, appreciate the time you took to provide your comments and feedback. Your attention to detail is truly outstanding! We hope to see you again soon, and look forward to your return. Congratulations on your little one on the way, and we hope to meet him or her some day too!
1	Home Away From Home. The Suncoast Hotel and Casino has become our home away from home. We are treated like family on our return visits. It's nice to see familiar faces the casino staff and restaurant staff. We especially enjoy the Oyster Bar Restaurant. The hotel rooms are beautiful, comfortable, clean, and roomy. The golf course and mountain views are beautiful while having breakfast. We always rent a car to visit some of our favorite places. Enterprise rent a car is right up the road they pick you up at the hotel and drop you off when you are done with the car. The distance between the strip and downtown is REALLY not a problem. The location and atmosphere is laid back away from the hustle and bustle of the strip and there is a Cheesecake Factory across the street where we always visit at least once while we are there. All in all, if you visit Las Vegas to relax and do some casual gambling, this is a gem of a place to stay. We would highly recommend the Suncoast, but rent a car if you want to check out the rest of the city......Aloha!
0	Hotel smells awful, Free Breakfast didn't exist and Owner is overall dishonest. I stayed at this hotel recently. A few things to note. 1. I got the hotel on priceline for 41 for the night.

1	GREAT service by staff. This is the third year I am staying at the Wingate, Cobb Drive in Atlanta, over the period of the same conference.The hotel needs a little renovation, but the VALUE for money, and the SIZE of the rooms, can't be beaten!However, the one thing I want to really compliment this year, is the Service by staff generally, and one person in Particular. The receptionist VERONICA is an amazing lady. Walking into the hotel yesterday after being away for 12 months, I was greeted like an old friend, welcoming me back. A smiling face and bright disposition really makes a difference, after what was an 800 mile drive from DC!Veronica is amazing, and really went out of her way to accommodate me in the PERFECT room for my stay of 5 nights.Thank you Veronica! Your outstanding and excellent service is appreciated more than you can imagine!Dear YCDBSOYA,Thanks for all of your feedback. I have shared your review with my staff to show them how important everyone is in creating a great guest experience. We look forward to serving you again in the future.Tremeil BooneFront Office ManagerWingate by Wyndham
1	Great Staff. This HGI is typical of the brand. However, the staff stood out as really friendly and helpful during my stay. I would recommend this hotel if you need to stay near the Orlando airport. The shuttle is convenient and reliable, the restaurant is nice, and the rooms are clean and crisp. There are restaurants within walking distance if you want to get out, and a sports bar behind the hotel if you want to have a few drinks without taking a cab or designating a driver. Good spot and experience.Thank you for the wonderful feedback regarding your stay with us at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport. We are glad to know that you enjoyed staying with us and that you loved our courteous staff, immaculate accommodations, as well as our restaurant. We are also happy to know that you liked our convenient location and the scheduled shuttle service we provided. We appreciate you recommending us and do hope to host you again in the future.All the Best,Charles StephensAssistant General ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando International Airport
0	Scammers - stay away. Coupon said 39.99 plus tax, 1-2 persons, everyday. Desk clerk wouldn't take coupon. Rate he wanted 65. That's a 50+ hike! Well, he lost two reservations. Never will come here, and you'd be best to do likewise. Take a look at the picture of the coupon.
1	Convenient. This is the 2nd time staying at the hotel. Very convenient to a club we go to for concerts. There are a number of good eating places nearby. A little confusing to get to if you are not familiar with the area. For some reason, there was only one bath towel in the room when we checked in, but they were able to get us a 2nd set shortly after we notified them. Also, the shower may have been hooked up incorrectly because H meant cold and C meant hot in our case. The breakfast is very good. Overall, we would stay there again good rates, friendly front desk, and the breakfast are all reasons to come back.
1	Excellent!. This is a true Kimpton Hotel experience--pet-friendly, person-centered--just absolutely wonderful. The first night of my stay, the hotel delivered a cheese/cracker/fruit plate (delicious). A paper was hung on my door each morning. The rooms were clean and quiet. The hotel was conveniently located to the Convention Center and in a safe location! Hotel staff were attentive and wonderful! The wine and beer reception hour (complimentary) was nice after a long day at work and play.Dear KrisG3333,Wow, thanks so much! So happy you enjoyed yourself and I'm very grateful for you acknowledging the hard work of our team. Have a great autumn and please come back soon.RobertGeneral ManagerHotel Solamar - a very Kimpton Hotel
0	Motel 6 at Marriott Prices. The lobby is nicer than a Motel 6 but everything else is Motel 6, well, except the price... Motel 6 costs about 1/4th of the price of the Courtyard Marriott. This Courtyard even has the standard motel polyester comforters (white but still polyester). The staff were nice. I enjoyed my stay at the Courtyard but was expecting more than the... More
1	Pleasantly Surprised. I didn't know about this hotel but was pleasantly surprised when we entered into the lobby. The hotel's decor was different from all the other Wyndham's we have visited. I absolutely loved it. The room was very spacious, and I loved the pool area although I don't swim, just to be able to go out in the patio area and sit in one of the cabana's was very relaxing. My only complaint about this hotel is that the exit and entry doors other than the lobby could not be accessed with our card keys. Would I go back again absolutely, and would I recommend this hotel to my friends, I most definitely would.Thank you for providing an honest and fair review! Our pool and cabana area is amazing, and is a highlight that many of our guests enjoy. Our engineers have addressed the issue with the doors to our building and reset the locking mechanism to ensure they are working properly. We look forward to seeing you again soon when your travels bring you back to North Dallas.
1	great service. a friend of mine stayed at this hotel with our kids. Brandon helped us with getting our room, he explained the aaa discount to us and was very friendly. He told us of all the services that the hotel provided. On our second stay, we came during a busy time for the hotel. Brandon told us that the there were no nonsmoking rooms available. He upgraded us to a suite, and gave it to us at the same rate as a standard room, and we were able to use the aaa discount as well. Our stay was wonderful, we didn't have any issues. The staff is very friendly, and willing to help with any questions or assistance needed. Its also in a great location, as my friend lives in Titusville its convenient , as she is able to get on the freeway and get to work on time. We now refer to the hotel as our hotel. I am the type of person that I usually would pay more to stay at an embassy suites. I always thought that best western was like a days inn. Brandon and the staff have helped to change my opinion of best western.
1	Centrally Located Hotel. I've found the Grand Hyatt to be a well located place to stay when visiting Seattle. The Pike Place Market, which is a must see, is a pleasant 10 minute stroll down the hill. Other tourist attractions e.g. the Seattle Wheel, the Aquarium etc, are approx a 20 minute walk. There are plenty of quaint places to eat including the larger franchise eateries close by.The rooms themselves are spacious and well equipped. The bathroom has a walk-in shower as well as a bath. There is a writing desk as well as a chair and ottoman, so you are able to relax and put your feet up.We were on the 27th floor, with a water view room. Nice outlook of Puget Sound.
1	Good Value. We stayed at the Best Western Mission Bay for vacation. Breakfast was great, rooms were clean, the noise level outside was a little loud and the door didn't muffle the noise well. Overall a good value motel.Good Evening,Thank you for completing the survey regarding your recent stay at our property. Your business is very important to us and we value your feedback. By telling us what you liked about your stay and how we can improve, you are helping us deliver a superior experience for you and other guests in the future. We hope you will come back and see us again soon.If we can be of assistance in the future, please don't hesitate to contact us anytime at 619.275.5700.Sincerely,MadisonGuest Services Agent
0	Good food horrible owners. Went for dinner and food was amazing. Only problem was the owner ray was wasted, knocking drinks over and we stayed all weekend and every night he was drunk. My gf said he wouldn't stop gropping her. Nice place but needs new ownership.
1	Atlanta Stay. Good location, friendly staff. Room was nice and bed was comfortable. Internet was slow so watching TV was difficult, and working on a computer from the room was impossible. Dear JCM691018,Thanks for all of your feedback. We definitely apologize for the quality of our internet service, thanks for sharing that with us so we can find a solution. I have shared your review with my staff to show them how important everyone is in creating a great guest experience. Thanks for letting us as a staff to Make it Right. We look forward to serving you again in the future.ThanksFront Office ManagerTremeil Boone
1	Ole king cole bar. Best place for lunch cocktail's the ole king cole bar is old world sophistication at its best. The chef produces the best soups lite bites he never disappoints. A welcome relief from the hustle and bustle of New York City when you enter this sanctuary of elegance Dear Louise,Since the hotels founding, we have looked to offer the best customer service possible. It is with pleasure that we get to read feedback from our guests, especially when we were able to meet the very high standard we aim to achieve.Thank you so much for taking the time to share your kind words and please do let us know when your next visit to the King Cole Bar is planned as we would love for you to be our guest once again!Kindly,Danny CooperDirector of Food Beverage Operations
0	Not bad hotel. The internet was broke for one night The staff were not helpful and almost rude The toilet also borke Totally not good experience
0	Fine as a last resort.... Imagine our disgust when we woke the following morning and found that the bed sheets had stains all over them.  If the hotels do nothing else, they should make absolutely certain their housekeeping staff is top notch and that they actually clean a room and change the bedding.  There were also dead insects on the floor of the bathroom.  I now know why this hotel had rooms available while everyone else was sold out.
1	Really nice hotel with a decadent decor. It somehow all works--the blacks and reds and silvers. The staircase to the second floor check-in (elevator also available of course), the lounging furniture in the bar area, and the pictures of flappers. It could have so easily fallen into Addams Family ambience or seedy/dark vibe, but the Allegro is a welcome relief from the stark modern, very utilitarian or hyperbolic opulence of other Chicago hotels. It is located on West Randolph next to the Palace Theater and 312 restaurant. It's an easy walk to shopping, great restaurants, the Art Institute, etc. The bed was great with four fabulous pillows. Plenty of outlets, a small but perfect bathroom with a good shower and a bath mat secured with a black ribbon. There's a chain lock on the door that provides extra privacy. The room was super quiet most of the time but it was a quiet weekend in the city. I was there alone and I think the room would feel a bit small for two people. The bar area was spacious decent wines by the glass at Chicago prices (15) and a decent bar menu. If you sit at the bar, prepare to mingle with the 20 and 30-somethings. Otherwise, take your drink to a quiet corner. They do a happy hour with prosecco and Pellegrino and there is coffee in the lobby in the morning. The place has the nicest doormen--right up there with the Magnolia in Memphis. Definitely worth a stay!Hey jhartig1!Thanks for your great review from your time with us at the Hotel Allegro! During the renovation, we definitely strived to capture the old glamour that our 1920's buildiong naturally has, so I'm happy to hear we were successful! Should your travels bring you back to Chicago, we do offer larger guestrooms that accommodate multiple people. Let me know if you need any assistance with future bookings and we hope to see you again in the future!Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager
1	Last Minute Trip. We were thrilled to find availability at this hotel, as we booked it the week before our trip. Most hotels were sold out in the area, so we were pleasantly surprised to find comfortable, clean, and hospitable accommodations. We loved the location, which was within a couple miles of Old Town San Diego. If we ever need to return, I will definitely book this hotel.October, 30. 2015Dear Maria Elena We thank you for choosing Best Western Seven Seas for your recent hotel accommodations. We are delighted to know we met your expectations at a busy time of year and that you enjoyed staying in our clean, comfortable guestrooms. We thank you for your feedback, guest satisfaction is always important to us. We look forward to welcoming you back on your next trip to San Diego here at the Best Western Seven Seas.Most Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff
1	Beautiful!. My husband and I spent 4 nights here. We visited the spa twice (massages and facials). Both experiences were perfect and the spa itself has amazing amenities and the staff is very friendly. Staff overall at the entire hotel is wonderful. Our package included breakfast each morning. The food and service were great, couldn't have asked for more! Couple of minor issues with the room, but when we spoke with management, they were very appreciative that we mentioned it and we were accommodated with a credit on our bill. Overall great experience and definitely would stay again!It was so wonderful to read all about you and your husbands recent stay with us! We are so happy to read that you both enjoyed your spa experiences as well as the great customer service you received. Your review will certainly be shared with the appropriate team as they will be so happy to hear all about your feedback. We truly hope to be able to welcome you both back again soon!
1	Excellent hotel. This was our first trip to New Orleans, so we had no experience with hotels in the city. We found the Drury Inn and Suites through reading reviews on TripAdvisor. The reviews were very helpful, and we are so glad that we stayed at the Drury. Our room was very nice, the bed comfortable and the air conditioning worked well. All the staff that we spoke to were very friendly and helpful. Wifi and breakfast are included in the price of the room as well as the 5:30 KIckback with three drinks per person and snacks. Another of the reasons that we chose this hotel based on the reviews on TripAdvisor was that the hotel is close enough to walk to the French Quarter and Canal Street, but far enough from the noise of Bourbon Street that you could actually get a good night's sleep. We were able to walk to the French Quarter for sightseeing and to the restaurants. The street cars to get to the Garden District or City Park are also within walking distance.We would definitely recommend the Drury Inn Suites to friends or family without hesitation and it would be our first choice as a hotel when we go back to New Orleans.
1	Wonderful stay!!. Just stayed at the hotel for five nights for an international conference. Loved the hotel: excellent service and a beautiful early 20th century architecture hotel: old Philadelphia. The service was excellent! My only concern was the swimming pool 3 feet in depth: do not quite get this. Other than the pool, we loved the hotel, the cafe/bar, Starbucks, and the care we were given. Certainly look forward to returning!Dear whiteoakspring,Thank you for choosing Courtyard Philadelphia Downtown during your recent trip to the area. We are pleased to hear that you enjoyed our outstanding location in the heart of Center City, with easy access to all the amenities and attractions Philadelphia has to offer. Our hotel is a unique property in Philadelphia, as we have the benefit of an historic building from 1926, combined with a complete modernization of the building, and a recent custom renovation. We look forward to your staying with us again soon.
0	Worst homeless in the alley ever. I entered the room with an overlook of the gas station next door, which was ok however the homeless guy that hung out and got drunk all weekend was the worst. I not only had to hear him from my room , but when I left the hotel to get something from the store I had to deal with him as well. It is clear the hotel cares for the front end of the building but won't deal with that back. Not worth the stay.Dear johntraveler1980,Thank you for staying with us at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown. I genuinely apologize for the trouble you experienced at our hotel and appreciate the time you took to write this review. Please know we continue to strive to meet all of our guests needs and expectations. Please know the items brought to our attention are being addressed with the Seattle Police Department. In the future, we hope you will give us another try and find your stay much improved to the last.Sarah Junge
0	Beware of Bed Bugs. I had two of my employees stay at the hotel form mid Sept to mid November. After coming from another hotel where there were no issues, thy began to have allergic reactions. After several thousand dollars in doctor bills we found that the room was infested with bed bugs. They moved my two employees to another room, which they had to do since they would not refund the payment, but then made them wash all their own cloths several times and made it known that the problem was not theirs but that my employees had brought them in with them. There was no compensation for the trouble or expense and the humiliation was uncalled for. So be prepared that if you stay here, that whatever goes wrong is your fault and nothing of the hotels responsibility and that you should be glad they even let you stay in their marginal hotel. I will make sure none of my employees ever stay there again. Also, tremendous noise and dust from the many construction sites around with no reduction in monthly rate due to the noise.Dear Bud PThank you for choosing us, as Weve told you before, as soon as we were notified about the situation, management were on top of the issue, and we are grateful that our pest control company was notified, checked all your luggage finding that the bed bugs were in your luggage and we were able to content and fix the situation changing you of rooms immediately. We are glad that you decided to extend your stay with us and we are able to have you as our guest for another extra month. We hope you enjoyed our complementary fruits and twice a week cleaning.
1	Great Stay! Thanks Virginia!. Stayed at Club Quarters Downtown in April. I was initially disappointed with the size/layout of my room, so went right back to the front desk to complain (rooms are small but clean and staff is helpful). Virginia, the gal at the desk apologized and instantly moved me to a room with a view of Chicago River. Since it was my first visit to Chicago I asked Virginia about things to do in the area. She inquired about my interests and 10 minutes later I had tickets for Wicked, one of the hottest shows in town, dinner reservations at Vivo, trendy Italian restaurant in the theater district. Next day Virginia suggested a trip to the Art Institute, only a 10 minute walk from the hotel! , walk in Lincoln Park and a very pleasant restaurant for dinner with live jazz . What a great city! I enjoyed my stay tremendously. Will be back, thanks again Virginia!
0	Disappointing to say the least. The Pros... Cheap, clean, quiet The Cons... We were supposed to be in adjoining rooms with the rest of our family for a graduation trip/celebration. They gave our room to someone else even though we had secured it online and were there at the dinner hour..... The pool and hot tub were closed. We were looking forward to using them... More
1	Good value. Stayed with many family members attending a family reunion in 6 different rooms. Most room numbers began with 1 so an incorrect assumption was that the rooms were on the first floor. The hotel seems to be on a slight rise and has different levels for the same floor. Our rooms on the same floor were either accessed via entrance 2, which required some stairs or entrance 3 which required no stairs. Note that there is no elevator. Some issues with a couple of rooms, but hotel staff was quick to rectify. My room included a refrigerator and a microwave. Breakfast in the conference room below had make your own waffles, hard-boiled eggs, toast and muffins, and oatmeal - coffee, tea, and juice.
0	"Experience ""the lowest common denominator""!. The purpose of my trip was to attend the wedding and reception of a friend's daughter. I was only driving up for this, and was not concerned about luxury and amenities. From the pictures, etc., that I viewed on-line, it looked like a good place for a brief stay. However, the whole hotel is in great need of maintenance work. The metal walkway and steps outside the rooms were rusty. The bathtub was old, caulking needed, mildew stains on a plastic towel holder. There were water spots on the sink handle when we arrived. Towels and washcloths provided were threadbare. Cigarette butts littered the parking lot and the metal walkway and steps. The advertised continental breakfast was definitely bare bones--bread, bagels, and waffles to pop in a toaster, cold cereal and milk, muffins, coffee, tea, and orange juice available. No yogurt or fresh fruit. Had I not prepaid for the room, I would not have stayed. My friend and I decided to wait to shower or bathe until we'd done the four-hour drive home."
1	Beautiful and Charming. I chose Estancia LaJolla after reading the promising reviews on Trip Advisor it was one of the few with no negative reviews and I was not disappointed. Lovely and charming place, not like a typical hotel. Wine Flight with cheeses at Trintas wine bar delightul. The dinner at Mustangs Burros delicious. Love the pool and gardens. One minor downgrade is the fact that our room was not ready by 4:00 p.m. we strolled around waiting for desk to call our cell phone after I told them the number to call. After 45 minutes we went back to the desk and room was ready. When I arrived back at home I had a message that room was ready - they apparently called my home instead. Other than that miscommunication, our stay was first rate.Thank you for selecting Estancia La Jolla for your travels to Southern California. Your kinds words about how lovely and charming our resort is mean a great deal to our team. We look forward to your next trip to La Jolla and hope that we will be host to your next stay.
0	Do not go here ... :(. We know people start a motel to make money .... but this is crazy !! The guy who helped us was very nice to us, nothing wrong there ... we got the room via booking.com ( bastards) the room looked okay at first ... pretty clean, a bit old, but okay ... but after our first night we had red little spots on our bodies ...we thought we had mosquito bites, but after another night we knew it were BedBugs ... we looked it up later on .... and we knew it cam from the bed .... what a bummer .... !!
0	Poor Management. I traveled 38 hours (2,592.3 miles) to this hotel. True indeed it is a nice hotel but management (Danielle or Daniella) is so unprofessional, inconsiderate, insensible, heartless, undiplomatic, shameless person. I booked my stay through expedia.com, expedia called to verify if i needed to book a day earlier due to my flight landing 12am which will cause my check in... More
0	Needs major renovation in the room. Furniture and fixtures were in desperate need of repair and updates. Desk was wobbly. Furniture was scratched. AC unit looked like it was going to die. Toilet seat was worn and needed to be replaced, etc.
1	Location Location Location. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel itself is a little tired but clean.I had a single room and would approx the size as 7ft by 15ft (hotel site may confirm). The view was to the apartments opposite and an alleyway below. I took earplugs as Ive been to NYC before and its noisy. The room had a singe bed, wardrobe, desk and mounted tv. Also had an ensuite. Rooms a little tired but again - clean. The toiletries were of a good standard which was a nice surprise.No breakfast facilities in the hotel - coffee and tea is available to take out in the mornings from a trolley in reception. The best thing about this hotel is its location. 5 mins from Broadway (Times Sq) - cant fault it.I will be back!!Dear Shy,Thank you for your comments regarding your recent stay. There is no one better to judge our performance than you, our guest. We have made great efforts to create an environment of comfort for our guests. May I recommend a larger room category for your future reservation I do believe you will be satisfied. On behalf of the hotels management team we thank you for your patronage and we look forward to welcoming you back to the Washington Jefferson Hotel.Sincerely yours,Management WJ Hotel
1	Expansive and well run property. We came and stayed two nights in this hotel as part of a wedding. our entire family was very pleased with the facility.The front desk was very courteous and effective. The staff seem very friendly. When we asked to be placed near the rest of our family they were able to accomplish this.Our hotel room was large and very clean with a fairly modern look. If you are looking for a very large hotel that supported multiple groups at the same time over a weekend this is your place.Thank you very much for the great feedback, we hope to see you back soon!
0	ripoff. Rioms were nasty nothing work properly. Out dated television, no refrigerator nor microwave in rooms then everyday rates goes up, as if thier offerring something for the amount of money veing spent. Didnt appreciate the false customers services front mgmt. He would make promises that he didn't keep. Very unhappy with my stay then he the mgmt would treat you like a dog. Didnt earn not one singke free stay after staying straight for 14days abd paid over 700. Too much extra from hotel and Wyndham rewards very misleading.
0	Not for me. Another cheap and unpleasant Durango, CO motel. Paper thin walls, dirty, curtain had holes and shredded edges, no hair dryer, no kleenex. I just needed one night's rest and didn't want to pay 150 at the nicer places but this room wasn't worth it.
1	Amazing stay !!!!. We booked a 3 bedroomed bungalow for our recent family holiday, the accommodation was outstanding, it had everything you could possibly want or need. the beds are super comfortable. It was spotless. The location is perfect seconds from the ocean front and minutes from restaurants and shops. The breakfasts were fantastic, the setting for breakfast was beautiful. All the staff members were extremely friendly and very helpful You will leave the Pantai Inn feeling relaxed and most definitely wanting to return. The fire-pit is a real highlight.Greetings Lgowtraveller,Thank you for taking the time to review Pantai Inn. We appreciated that you and your family traveled such a great distance to stay with us. Fortunately, we have the opportunity to welcome guests from all around the world. All of the team here does their very best to ensure that they all feel at home. Thanks you for outlining your accommodations, the amenities that were included with your stay, as well as a bit about the surrounding area. Come back and stay with us again soon! All my best,Mike
1	Great location and very clean. We stayed there for 2 nights and staff were very friendly and helpful. It was in a great location and quite central to restaurants and cafe's. bed was comfy and bathroom was nice and clean. I would go back again if visiting San Francisco.Dear Julie M,We certainly appreciate that you took the time to share your review about your recent stay with us and the Trip Advisor community. We are pleased that you enjoyed our accommodations and service! We hope to welcome you back on your next trip to San Francisco, thanks again!Best regards,Haiyi Hotels Worldwide
0	Blood stained sheets. I took my significant other to Springhill Suites for a weekend of relaxation for his birthday and I was very disappointed. When we decided to lay down there was a blood stain on 2 different sheets. We also did not use the shower because it was a grey film covering the bottom of the bathtub. I also think there was a laundry room next to us due to all of the noise and banging early in the morning. Overall, the cleanliness of the room was a problem, but the front desk staff was very friendly!! oh and I could've done without the breakfast!!
0	STAY AWAY FOR GOD'S SAKE. I don't even know where to begin with. I am totally disgusted with the entire experience. My nightmare began as soon as I reach the hotel and find out that my room (which was requested over the phone and confirmed by the front desk staff) was not available. I was given only 2 options, so had to settle for one. The property is filthy, dirty, stains everywhere from carpet, sofa, chairs to curtains and even on ceiling. Bed was very uncomfortable, loud noises from above, corridors, parking lots, creaking floors, slamming doors. Hair in bathroom, extremely loud a/c. The list will just go on and on.The icing on the cake comes the next day morning at checkout, I am asked to pay extra for my room. Rude staff, no sense of customer service whatsoever. I told her that I had booked the stay via priceline.com and pre-paid for my stay. She wanted to look at paperwork, expressly stating that I can't take your word for it, I have to see the paperwork. Insisted that she had all records, but surprisingly couldn't find mine. I refused to pay any extra money and she had to call and change the rate codes. Whatever !!Please save yourself and DO NOT ever stay at this place. I am disgusted beyond words.I appreciate you taking the time to write a review of your experience with us. The cleanliness of the hotel and the interaction with the front desk you described is unacceptable, and I sincerely apologize for your experience. To make sure this doesn't happen again, I am meeting with the entire staff to review your comments and discuss how we can avoid a similar situation in the future. We continually work to improve our hotel, so I really appreciate you providing us with your feedback. Please do not hesitate to contact me directly, at dmcextendedstay.com, should you wish to discuss this further. We would love to have another chance to provide you with a better experience at our hotel the next time you're in town.
1	I loved my stay in Atlanta. This was the most amazing place ever! I was in ATL for business and the hotel staff treated me like a princess. My first evening in ATL I had a box of chocolates waiting in my room welcoming me to ATL. The bell man, John I believe, was incredibly friendly and professional. My birthday was during my 2-week stay, the concierge received a phone call from my family and he arranged flowers to be delivered to my room when I returned home (to my hotel room) from work. The flowers were gorgeous and the head concierge paid special attention to having his most trusted florist prepare the arrangement. Considering the long duration of my stay upon my request, the hotel staff gladly assured that I had a refrigerator in my room as well. I wish I could stay at this hotel forever- I had a great experience!!
1	Loved this hotel.. This was the best hotel I ever stayed in. The rooms are very clean and my kids was able to be where I could watch them and also have privacy. I really enjoyed my stay. If I ever come back to Dallas this is where I would stay. Dear maricos2015,Thank you for your kind words regarding your stay at the Hawthorn Suites Dallas Park Central. We were glad to have you and your kids as our guests, and appreciate you taking the time to comment regarding your visit with us. We look forward to the opportunity to host you again the next time you are in the Dallas area. Thanks again for being our guest! Best regards, Charlie Westhoven Operations Manager Hawthorn Suites Dallas Park Central
1	Great Hotel!. Stayed for two nights in a corner room which was light and airy, very well designed in a clean modern style. Beds very comfortable, great blinds on the Windows, no fussy furniture! Bathroom worked well, nice big vanity unit and a hairdryer that plugged in easily next to the huge mirror, for anyone who likes to dry their hair you'll know what I'm talking about! Sliding mirrored door to shower/toilet all gave the feeling of space. The only slight niggle was the a/c which was a bit noisy, not enough to bother us though. Easy walk to many places, shops and attractions. Will definitely stay Aloft again!!Come on back anytime! It's good to know that you enjoyed your stay with us and glad you found the room and location to your liking. Thanks for taking the time to share.
0	Not worth the money. Not the best place we have stayed at in Atlantic City but it was the worse. Rooms had a moldy smell. The first night we stayed there a fight broke out in the hallway. The second night another fight broke out. Now I understand the hotel can't control that but to a certain extent I feel like the annex just... More
1	Clean room good service. For a hotel option near the airport this would be very good selection. Clean room and good service. They offer free shuttle service between the airport and the hotel. For those who like a gym they have one near the lobby. Thank you for the wonderful feedback regarding your stay at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport. We are delighted to read you loved all the aspects of our property, especially our close proximity to the airport. We appreciate you recommending us online and hope to have you back with us soon.Sincerely,Michael GoldwasserGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport
0	I will NEVER stay here again. this hotel happened to be the last one to have rooms for the time me and my friends were down there! Talk about a nasty rundown place, first off we walked in our room and the sheets and bed looked unfit to sleep on, the smell was nasty and we had to let our room air out, when we went... More
0	Very Disappointing. The hotel overall is a great facility. I liked the room and the size of the room. The room was a little dated and the beds were very uncomfortable, but they are currently going through a renovation, so this should not be a problem much longer. My main issue was the service. My first impression of the hotel is what I would call the valet mafia. I just wanted to leave my car out front long enough to get checked into the hotel. The valet made me give him my key. There were several cars parked out front, which I later realized were valet customers whose cars were staying in front of the hotel and would not be moved. The check in staff was very nice and courteous. Very thorough explaining all their policies, etc. When I went back outside to move my car, I had to wait on my keys and it was obvious they were expecting a tip. After we got into our room, it was late, so we decided to just go to the restaurant in the hotel, Medici. Service was awful and we seemed to be an inconvenience for our waiter. Both mornings at breakfast in the Atrium Cafe, we received the same type of service. On Saturday evening, after returning from dinner, parking was a nightmare. Valet had taken all of the handicapped parking places at the hotel we were told we had to park in the deck which is a very long walk back through the hotel to the lobby elevators. This is not acceptable. But, my worst experience was in the lobby the morning of our check out. Apparently a guest had some type of issue. I do not know what it was, but a hotel employee (I think they were from the food service staff, maybe a chef) was working with them and appeared very put out with the guest. Situations like this happen, but what I found totally unprofessional was after hotel employee spoke with the guest again and coming to no solution, he walked back over the the front desk and told the front desk person that he was not dealing with this --. Totally unprofessional.Thank you so much for taking the time to give us your feedback, it is very helpful to hear about the experience our customers have had. I am very dissapointed with what you have described, particularly with the service in my hotel. It is not typical and I would like to learn more to enable me to follow through on your experience. If possible I would like to speak to you to learn more details. I can be reached at 770 303 3186. I am very sorry for your experience and hope to have the chance to have you back to the Renaissance Waverly Hotel.
0	Never again. The purpose of my trip was to spend time playing in a swimming pool with my grandchildren. I called to make sure the pool was open before making my reservation, and was told that it was. The phone person was at a remote location, and he said he checked. I got there, only to find out that the pool was... More
1	St Regis is the best hotel in New York by far. I stayed at St Regis for 3 days this weekend and I was treated like a king.This is an amazingly beautiful hotel right at 5th ave.From the moment you walk in you feel special.The service and the staff were amazing and the butler service they have adds to the value.Dear Hagopyouredjian, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor. We hope to see you again soon!Kindly,The St. Regis Management Team
1	A Joyful Surprise. Arriving into San Diego, GPS has me going down this scrappy looking strip dotted with low-end motels, convenience and liquor stores. Right away, I am chiding myself for relying only on T.A. and not talking with locals before booking the non-refundable special here. By the neighborhood's appearance I was certain I'd erred. The Pearl's unassuming exterior belies the treasures within. Upon walking into the courtyard/pool area, I met two cute and perky young gals at front desk who introduced me to Greg, the owner. I know I had a dubious look on my face as I began to question him about the clientele here, the noise level, the neighborhood, etc. Greg assured me this was a popular locals place for bar/dining, a favorite lodging place for an older crowd and young families, and not a wild partying venue. While he could have said, you will LOVE this place instead he was matter of fact, polite and reassuring. Upon entering the room, I knew I'd hit the jackpot....and within 5 minutes I found Greg at poolside with his co-workers, as I exclaimed, I LOVE this place! The room's retro dcor, cleanliness, ultra-modern touches and amenities set the stage for the ultimate in mid-century motif - right down to Jaws the lone fish swimming in a bowl mounted to the wall. At 4-6 Happy Hour, the relaxed and festive bar came alive with such friendly patrons and accommodating, crisp hotel staff. Between the hum of the AC and an incredibly comfortable bed, both nights of sleep were blissful. The restaurant is divine. I sat on the shag-covered pad by the lobby with a tray table as it was full for Valentine's prix fixe dinner. Service and food were superb. The feeling of pride among the staff in the care of the Pearl and its guests is palpable. While the location is a bit inconvenient to downtown, Point Loma is close by for spectacular views, and after a day of Balboa Park and sites in the city, it is a welcome retreat to return here. So, I will ONLY book at the Pearl on subsequent SD trips and sing its praises to anyone I know heading this way for holiday.
1	Would Return. This Hotel was much better than expected after reading some of the negative reviews here. I was incredibly pleased with the room, the staff, and the location. The room was fairly modern with 2 perfect double beds. The bathroom and shower were perfect. The Hotel is a 5 minute drive to downtown Napa and about 10-15 minutes to the Silverado Trail. The hotel provided breakfast coupons to Denny's which is directly next door and was perfect for us - I had a healthy egg-white and fruit breakfast while my travel companions gorged themselves on Denny's Grand Slam. I would definitely return here for its cleanliness, staff, and proximity to everywhere I wanted to be.I am glad we surpassed your expectations. We pride ourselves on our clean well appointed rooms and our customer service. Thanks for the review and we will see you on your next visit.
0	Pass this one by.. Rude staff. Staff had no clue about restaurants or nearby amenities. They were clueless. Room Was on first floor by parking lot and loud. Heater was also loud. Paid 160/nt. Not worth it. It does have underground free parking.
1	one night stay. We stayed here one night, because it was the end of our family vacation, and we ended up staying too late to leave/drive home. So we got this place cause it was cheapest in the area, and ended up being almost better than the room we had just stayed in for a week. The beds and pillows were so nice and fluffy, the floors were new and nice not dirty. There was a micro, fridge, and coffemaker. The tv was a flat screen. The bathroom was newly redone and very nice. Was happy i didn't have to be scared.
1	LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this hotel! The PERFECT Place to Stay When in Chicago. My stay in Chicago could not have been better. Hyatt Place Downtown Loop Chicago is the PERFECT place to stay because of the location, facilities and--most importantly--the staff, who you can tell take pride in their jobs and their hotel. Immaculately clean entry, lobby, dining...MoreDear Collin D, Wow, thank you for your sharing such a strong endorsement of our hotel. We appreciate your kind words and will be sure to share your kudos with our staff. Thank you and I hope we will see you again in the Loop...More
1	Charming. Beautiful hotel in a great location. Staff was friendly and helpful. We stayed in the Sorrento Suite, which was the perfect space to relax and also enjoy while getting ready to go out for the evening. There were no issues with noise at all. The bartender could actually make a cocktail and the breakfast was excellent. We will definitely return.Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us. We strive to make this a relaxing and welcoming place for all our visitors. I'm happy to hear you enjoyed your breakfast and I agree that our bartenders can make a cocktail! Please come and stay with us again soon. Angie M. MykelGeneral Manager-Hotel Sorrento
0	NOT shabby chic, just shabby. NOT shabby chic, just shabby. We had stayed at the Chelsea in the past and expected the Annex to be at least similar. But it was more like a downgraded, poorly maintained motel 6 trading on the good name of the Chelsea. Check in took 25 minutes waiting in line. The first room had high basement type windows (that were broken and didn't lock) looking over the roof where the air handlers were. The second room had a broken lock on the patio door. The patio was flooded, the dresser was chipped, stained, and drawers wouldn't stay closed, the bathroom door was water damaged at the bottom and stained, the bathroom floor was stained and dirty. Both rooms we saw were shabby and desperately in need of upgrades. The elevator floor was damaged and missing tiles, the restaurant downstairs (which was cute and hip in the past) is now old and shabby also. Not worth the money. As it is now, I would not recommend this hotel at all.
1	Another wonderful stay. We brought our 6 year old granddaughter to Chicago with us. We have stayed at this hotel at least 6 times and have never been disappointed. The location is perfect for walking to many touristy spots. We even walked to and from union station. Thank you for staying with us recently and for your kind recommendation both are greatly appreciated! We are pleased to hear that you are a great fan of the River Hotel and delighted that your granddaughter had a wonderful stay. We agree -- our prime location in the heart of the city is perfect for experiencing all that Chicago has to offer.We look forward to welcome you back to the River Hotel very soon!
1	Awsome Experience. A little pricey, however the location and service was excellent. Breakfast is not the best, at least as a Diamond level is complementary. I highly recommend this property, location, staff and rooms are excellent. Thank you for taking the time to write this review of your stay and we are delighted to know you enjoyed almost everything about your stay. We are currently transitioning our restaurant and trying out some new items and processes, please know that the breakfast service will improve as this is a main priority. It was our pleasure to have you as our guest and do hope to have you stay with us again.Best regards
0	Stuffy. The bath tub had a bad leak the AC was horrible and on top of the bad odor the room stayed stuffy. When I informed the staff they did nothing and I told them after check in and at check out. Not even an apology. I hate to be the one leaving a bad review but this was badThank you for your recent review of your stay. I am very sorry for the level of cleanliness and lack of repairs made in your room. As well, I apologize that our staff did not respond properly to your requests for assistance. In response to your comments, I am coaching our staff on how to provide better customer service moving forward. Plus, I will be working with our housekeeping and maintenance staff on how to improve our cleaning as well as repair policies so that a situation like yours is not repeated.Thank you again for providing us with your feedback. I invite you to contact me at mvlextendedstay.com if you have any additional comments. We hope that you will give us the opportunity to provide you with a better stay the next time you're in the area.
1	Wonderful Place for Old Friends' Reunion. A dozen old friends decided to take advantage of a special offer at the Estancia to spend some time together. In a sentence, we had a wonderful time. The staff were each helpful and friendly. A gardener stopped what he was doing to give me directions (the grounds are very large and could use a few more directional signs). The concierge advised us of some restaurants with water views that could accommodate our group and made the reservation for us.The rooms at our price point, while not impressive looking, were roomy enough, very clean, had large flat screen TVs, and nice toiletries. The bathroom was modern with marble counter top. Hair dryer and iron were provided. One pricing feature I liked was the hospitality fee. Instead of being nickeled and dimed for different extras, the most common ones are all in one fee which included access to the exercise area, wi-fi, bottled water, a welcome drink in the lobby, morning coffee in the wine bar, and a free margarita (very tasty) in the bar. Our special offer included valet parking. The hotel was very busy with several weddings and other events, but the valets never kept us waiting longer than 5-10 minutes. There is a lavish buffet breakfast on the weekends which is 22, more than my budget allows for breakfast. The server told us that for half that price, we could have a 'continental breakfast' which included all the cold items, even smoked salmon with capers and also hot oatmeal. That was a good deal.Located directly across from University of California San Diego and adjacent to the Salk Institute, this property is not right on the beach, but there are walking trails next to the hotel. While the shops and attractions of La Jolla and San Diego are nearby, the Estancia provides a tranquil retreat from the crowds. Our room on the ground floor was rather dark. I would request a room on the third floor next time. A major refurbishing is planned for early 2013 which should brighten up the rooms. I would also have liked more outdoor places to sit and relax with my friends. We had a very enjoyable stay.Thank you so much for taking the time to write a review. Your comments and feedback are very much appreciated by the team here at the hotel as well as potential future guests. It sounds like you had a nice time catching up with old friends, and Im glad our concierge was able to assist your group with a fun and memorable night out. We hope to welcome you back for the next reunion!
1	Historic Charm on Royal St. I stayed in two seperate rooms at this hotel. The first was 209 upstairs over looking the shared balcony. It was small but clean and gorgeous, perfect for one person. My only complaint is the Windows don't open, as they've been painted over. Would be nice to get some fresh air, although this room has its own thermostat with air. The staff was amazing and watched my bags for me the entire next afternoon after check out, as I wasn't sure if I was gonna stay again or not. I decided to stay, and they offered me a similar rate to the first night even though prices went WAY up. The girls at the front desk are super awesome. The next room I stayed in was downstairs, definitely larger than the first, just as beautiful but different. The energy was different, it was dark, and I had a few issues with cell phone reception, not picking up the guest wifi and a broken TV that they couldn't do anything about. Overall I loved staying at this hotel. It felt special. It is special. Its a fantastic hotel to stay at if you want the NOLA French Quarter experience. On a personal note: this hotel is definitely haunted. I not only had the same dream both nights that were pretty spooky and gruesome, but I awoke the second morning to someone humming softly into my ear and a grab/scratch at the back of my neck. Let's just say my heart was POUNDING!
1	Great location! Great views!. If you're looking for a vacation on the beach, I recommend this hotel. Gated underground parking (10/day), friendly front desk staff, 1 minute walk from your room to the beach. Right on the boardwalk, so whether you're looking for ice cream and a hotdog or a sit-down dinner after a day at the beach, it's all within walking distance. Forgot sunscreen, sunglasses, etc There are shops right on the board walk for that. Forgot toiletries, etc There's a CVS right behind the hotel. While the decor wasn't fancy, the hotel was always clean. The bathrooms were updated: walk-in, glass-doored, tiled showers and very large vanities, plenty of room for a family to spread out. Beds were so-so soft but not the most comfortable. If you're willing to pay premium, stay in the ocean-front rooms. We loved sitting on the balcony at night, people-watching and listening to the waves. You can hear the waves from the rooms with the sliding glass doors or windows open, but it's actually very quiet with them closed. We did stay on the north-end of the hotel, so I can't speak for the south-end where there are some restaurants/bars right next door that get loud at night/on weekends.You can also walk pretty much anywhere in Pacific Beach from here shopping, restaurants, etc. I recommend The Mission (in Mission Beach) and Leilani's Cafe for breakfast. Each is about a 15-20 mins walk from the hotel.Overall, happy with our stay, and we would stay again!Thank you for taking the time to provide our prospective guests with some great tips. We are glad to hear you had an enjoyable stay with us at the OPI. Thank you for highlighting our location, as we strongly believe that our location cannot be beat! As you mentioned we are centrally located and anything you could possibly need is within walking distance. We look forward to seeing you again soon.
0	Less than average. 3 stars is a bit over what I would call this hotel. The rooms are old and the walls are thin. Hopefully you can find a silent corner of the hotel because if you neighbors or anyone outside is talking in a regular voice, it sounds like they're in the room. Parking and location is convenient. Nice waterway next door to walk around. With the availability in the area, I would look at other options
1	Great Hotel For Walking To Most Attractions. My wife and I stayed here with our 2 grandchildren for 5 days in April. The room amenities are very nice with very comfortable bedding and living area. The Kitchen area is small, however, with a small mini refrigerator and microwave so if you are planning to eat many meals in your room, this is not the hotel for that. We walked to Little Italy, the Gas Lamp area, PETCO Park and to the USS Midway. Very convenient to all locations. They have Valet parking and a restaurant on property although we did not use it. They also have a fitness area and a indoor pool.Steve, thank you for a perfect review! We are so happy to hear you and your family enjoyed your stay with us here in San Diego. We hope you will visit us again sometime.
1	Enjoyed my stay here. This is a great hotel at a great price. I stayed here for four nights from May 27 to June 1. Not only are the amenities great, free continental breakfast, free Wi Fi, free parking, a laundry room, restaurant and bar, books, magazines, a nice sitting room and comfortable bedrooms with air conditioning, tubs, showers, and cable TV. You are within walking distance of parks, shops, restaurants, bars, and public transportation. I also discovered by accident that It is just two blocks from President Jimmy Carter's museum. What else can you askThank you for taking the time to leave such an extensive and wonderful review of the hotel. We love that you appreciate our uniqueness and that you were able to experience our wonderful area. Please come back and visit us again soon!Best, Kristin AndersonAssistant Hotel ManagerThe Highland Inn
0	Night staff rude and condescending.. Staff was extremely rude. Shockingly rude. Zero customer service skills.
0	Do not stay here. Gave us the keys to an ocupied room. Waited 20 mins or more to figure out the attendant had given the room we reserved away to a friend. In his words for free Charged twice for our room. Ended up being placed in a smoking room that was filthy. Shredded blankets. Loud wild crowd in parking lot and on... More
1	Very friendly staff !!. I was visiting the area for business and picked this hotel for its proximity to my meetings. I had some flight issues flying into California, so had to call and change my reservation. When I called the hotel I spoke with Viri, who was super helpful and very friendly. She took care of everything and had a great sense of humor. When I checked in Viri happened to be working with a few others at the front desk. They were all extremely friendly and welcoming. The coffee in the lobby all day is a nice perk. I was unable to enjoy breakfast, but it looked nice as I grabbed an apple and ran out the door to meetings. I will definitely be staying at this location if I have any future business in the Anaheim area. Management should be proud of their friendly, helpful, and smiling staff.
1	Great location very good hotel. There is a lot to recommend about this hotel. First and foremost is the location, it is near enough the French Quarter - two blocks across Canal St. - the streetcar lines, downtown, the Garden District, to be very convenient for most of what you might want to do in NOLA. The rooms are very clean, well appointed, comfortable though can be on the small side. And be warned, they do have some rooms that don't have windows. If you are at all claustrophobic you want to make sure that you aren't in one of those. The rooms are quiet and the service in the hotel is good. There is a serve yourself snack and breakfast bar downstairs and prices are okay, but if you really want breakfast or snacks - YOU'RE IN NEW ORLEANS - many far better options are not far away. Prices can be a little high for rooms, but you can usually find a good deal if you look around a bit. They are competitive in any event. It is somewhat more of a young person's, have fun in NOLA kind of hotel than it is a family venue. I'll be staying there again most likely when I am in town.We gained another loyal guest and we are so excited about that! Thanks for your review and we look forward to having you back.
1	Beautiful place for a conference. Looks like a garden with villas but really is a big conference center! It was wonderful not being in a typical corporate-feeling conference hotel. The meeting venue and food were great but so was the room and service. Loved the fresh brand toiletries and frette linens. Comfortable bed. We ate at a few of the restaurants which were also great! Close walking distance to Torrey Pines Gliderport and next door to Salk institute. There is a free shuttle provided by the hotel for destinations within 5 miles, which we used to get to down town La Jolla. Shuttle driver was really nice and gave us recommendations on what to do in the area.The only negatives were the gym, which was much smaller than I expected with poor ventilation, and the pillows were smaller than standard pillows which was a little annoying. I didn't pay for this stay so I can't say much regarding value for money but as a conference venue I've never been to a better one.
0	Poor.. Room not ready 8p at night. No discount offered or even a bottle of water. Waited for another hour. Front desk attendant was rude and non-apologetic. Would never stay here again.

1	Wonderful stay. We really enjoyed our stay at the Best Western Mission Bay. The room was very clean and the staff was friendly and attentive. It was also convenient to get to from the freeway. The continental breakfast was great. There was a good variety of food. I would definitely recommend this place to my family and friends.Good Afternoon,Thank you for taking time to review your stay with us here through TripAdvisor.I'm happy to know you had a wonderful stay and were happy with our rooms and locations.

1	BW - Napa. This hotel is a reasonably good place to stay if you want to visit the Napa Valley. Our room was clean and pleasant, the staff members we encountered were helpful and professional, and the price we paid for our room (during December of 2014) was reasonable. However, potential guests should be aware that, according to information we were given by a staff member, rates may be different during the summer.Thank you for your review. I am glad you enjoyed your stay and the service we provided. Yes the summer rates are higher, but we are still one of the most reasonably price hotels during that time of year. Hope to see you again.
0	running a scam beware. I had booked a reservation through Priceline.com for a non-smoking room. When I arrived at the hotel I was informed succinctly that my reservation came through for a smoking room. Although there were non-smoking rooms available, I was charged 11 to change to a non-smoking room. Calls from customer service agents at Priceline had no effect at all. The front desk clerk admitted to me that this happens very frequently (every day she said) to people who book through Priceline or Hotwire. I believe this hotel is running a scam to earn extra revenue by charging unsuspecting customers extra money for non-smoking rooms. Shameful. I will never stay there again.Let me start by thanking you for completing our Guest Survey regarding your recent stay at our property. I apologize for not exceeding your expectations. We strive to ensure each and every guest experience is satisfying. Please know that we are taking your feedback to heart and focusing on improving. As you know when you buy your room through hotwire / priceline with name your price you are giving up lot of prevallage, such as choice of your hotel, room type ect. This type of booking channel will give you deep discount but any guest request is subject to availabity, if we don't have same room type we offer guest choice to upgrade to diffrent room type and pay the diffrence (once again this upgrade is subject to availability). I advice if guest has specific need please book through Bestwestern.com and select room type of their need. Each room type and rates are clearly explain. Again, I apologize for the inconvenience during your stay and hope to see you during your next visit.
1	Excellent hotel with great location. Have spent five nights in this nice hotel perfectly located , only couple of minutes from Union Square.We had two connecting rooms accomodating five of us, both perfectly decorated , very spacious and well maintained. Staff is extremly friendly and willing to help. With my youngest daughter have also used pool which is quite largem, clean and not crowded. Only complaint is cost of in room wi-fi access (this kind of hotel should have it complimentary) as well as breakfast arrangements - although waitress are helpfull and polite - 20 minutes to get eggs and croissiants is not acceptable (and also quote expensive)Dear Guest,We would like to thank you for taking the time to review The St. Regis San Francisco. We are pleased to hear that you and your family had a wonderful stay with us and enjoyed our room dcor and hotel amenities. I apologize for the delay in your breakfast service and appreciate your comments regarding the in room wi-fi. I encourage you to contact me directly so that we may discuss the details of your stay and how we may improve your experience.Sincerely,William FongHotel Manager415-284-4057
0	No Improvements. Please see my review of 11-9-2014 in the Terrible Category. I decided to give the Hotel another try, really nothing has changed. The room assigned was near the highway, so noise is still present. Wall are paper thin, so you can hear outside noise as well as your neighbors, doors slam with a loud noise. HVAC system is weak, and... More
1	Always a great stay at a great location for Mardi Gras parades. This was our second trip here during Mardi Gras. This hotel is older, but everything is up to date. The suites are large and clean. We stayed on the 7th floor suites which included a mini fridge, microwave, and front lounge area with separate tv. The staff here is awesome. The plus for us is, this hotel is located around 1 block of the parade route. Being at the end of the route also gives you the opportunity to score bags and bags stuff being slung off the floats. It's also so close that if you have to use the restroom, you have a clean private restroom right around the corner. If you don't mind the walk, this location is also only around half a mile from Burbon and French Quarter. There are other hotels near, but we enjoy this hotel enough that we would continue to lock down a room during this party.They also have a buffet breakfast, nothing fancy... eggs, sausage, waffles, fruit, cereal, grits, biscuit and gravy. From 530-7p they have happy hour which includes 3 drinks.
1	An enjoyable vacation. The staff was very friendly and outgoing. I would like to give special thanks to Mr. Robert Luera, Antionette and Verna. These people made my stay very special. Truly a very enjoyable time in the best Texas Hospitality Tradition. The room and all other facilities were very clean, and I would definitly stay here again!Hi Michael, I want to thank you for taking the time to post a review of your stay. I'm so pleased to hear that you enjoyed your stay and the staff showed our Texas Hospitality. Thank you again for sharing your experience with us. We would love to see you again, should your travels bring you back to our area.
1	Very enjoyable stay.Great value.Huge room.. Hotel was clean and hotel staff very helpful. The room was huge and bed was so comfortable. Great shower. Bartender terrible. We were there with a football group and the bar was full of men, and the bartender had both TV's in the bar on Access Hollywood and some other entertainment gossip show. I don't think one person stayed for more than one drink, we couldn't wait to get away from the TV programming. As we approached and sat at bar, she (bartender) was standing under one of the TV's watching intently. She glanced over her shoulder and slowly tore herself away from the Prince Harry Vegas scandal. Just as she finished taking our order, another guy sat right next to us and she didn't even bother to acknowledge him. She slowly finished serving our drinks, she had to open a new bottle of wine for my order . . . because the TWO bottles in the cooler were BOTH empty. How can she have time to watch TV and have empty bottles and be low on suppliesWe will be staying here again on our next 2 visits to Atlanta, however we will skip the bar.Thank you for your feedback, I really appreciate knowing when things go well and when they do not. I am so sorry for your exeprience in my bar and assure you it is not typical! Please contact me directly the next time you are coming to Atlanta and your first round will be on me! I want to change your perception of our bartender and TV programing! Hope to see you soon.
1	The 2 bedroom suite is great for a large family. We stayed here when we came to Anaheim to watch Angels games two nights in a row. It was the perfect location. It is across the street from the stadium and there are a few places to eat that range from Carls Jr to a nicer sit down restaurant (The Catch I think). The hotel provides a continental breakfast which was a pretty standard hotel breakfast. It's always convenient when traveling with kids. There was barely any room to sit and very busy. One morning I ended up finding a table and the next morning I took our food out to the pool and sat out there with the kids which was very peaceful. The pool area is small, but enough to keep the kids busy for a couple of hours. It was a nice temperature, not too cold. They also loved going between the pool and jacuzzi. The room slept 6 of us, but was not spacious. It was nice to have the 2 queens in separate bedrooms and a living area, so if someone wanted to rest, they could close the door and others could watch TV in another room. There were 3 TVs. The beds were OK. The bathroom was small considering the room slept 6 people (not 6 adults, but doable with a mixture of adults and kids). The kitchen area was more than adequate to bring some food with you, prepare it and not eat out every meal. The decor is updated, but some areas of the room felt worn. The room was clean and we had excellent service at the front desk.Hello Snulie,Thank you for taking the time to write such a wonderful review about your recent stay at the TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Marriott. It is candid reviews like yours, that allow us to continually look at ways to make guest's stay more comfortable and relaxing. I have mentioned your comments to the appropriate department managers, and we are brainstorming ways to review your areas of concern. We are delighted to serve you again, if your travel needs bring you back to the Orange County area. Thanks again!Warmest Regards
1	Great stay. Our Agent booked us 5 nights at the Shoreline Waikiki at the end of February and it did not disappoint. Great boutique style hotel in very good location and lovely staff. Special mention to Josh and Venus who were so happy to help. Whilst the rooms (we had 721) are not luxurious they are very clean and comfortable with all the promised amenities including good Wifi. The complimentary grab and go muffins and health bars at breakfast were very convenient for early starts and very tasty. Infused waters and 24/7 coffee and tea in Reception also great. Used the roof top pool area on a couple of afternoons after sightseeing. Also borrowed the chairs from reception for the beach which is only a short walk away. For info there are self-service laundry facilities at the Coconut Waikiki, the sister hotel a short walk away, again very helpful reception if you need change for the wash machines. Breakfast wise we did use the Heavenly Restaurant next door which was very nice but also very busy. Most days we used the Dukes Lane Market Eatery around the corner on Kuhio Avenue which catered for all tastes. Certainly lived up to its good Trip reviews.
0	Customer Service. The room was not tidy, the customer service was horrible!!!! We could not stay the second night. Had to leave because the hotel service and cleanliness, and no hot water!!!!!!!!!!!
0	There's Probably Better Alternatives. I stayed here as part of my job as a professional pilot. Having gotten an emergency call to take some people to a very small town in Virginia so they could repair a piece of their customer's equipment, I had only a very short amount of time to research options and this was the requested airport in which to fly....

0	camping. unhappyr We camped there last year. This year we considered going back but the river has flooded the area and our campsite is still muddy and it is July 18th. The owner still wants the full summers rate for camping which, by the way, she raised the prices this year. The owner is constantly sitting at her picnic table and scowls at the campers. She doesn't smile. When she told us that the rates couldn't be discounted we told her that we wouldn't be camping there this year. She said fo...view morer us to get our stuff out of there in one week or she would call the authorites. She said we couldn't camp there ever again. Her son is wonderful and helps his mom run the campground but he has to listen to his controlling mother. She also charges 2 dollars a head for visitors. She's all about the almightly dollar. She called us unfaithful. She even doesn't like our 2 little daschunds. They need to be tied up. Save yourself some money and heartache. DON'T STAY HERE!r r rview less
0	Looks are deceiving. The pictures on the web site are very deceiving from the actual property itself. The rooms are very small, lighting poor and free in room was HORRIBLE! The website said the onsite restaurant was coming in 2012 so we figured they would have a place to eat but did not, however, they did way there were plenty of places across the street in walking distance which turned out to be 3.
1	As Local As You Can Get. The young, hip hotel guests probaby cringed when they saw me schlep my 4, 6, and 8 year olds through the front door and I immediately realized our family was not the hotel's target demographic, but we LOVED this place. As a former New Orleans resident, this is as local as you can get. Compar Lapin was unbelievable and my children could not get enough of their homemade pasta and gnocchi and probably would have gone home with our server, Clare (that is how much they liked her). The head cocktail crafter, Abby, was super friendly and insanely adorable and her staff was extremely talented and helpful. The room was so comfortable my children slept almost two hours past their norm, which was probably appreciated by the majority of guests who had been tearing up their livers the night before. We did not use maid service so my only suggestion would be a little more counter space in the bath and more towels. Other than that, it was perfect.
0	Don't expect a good nights sleep.. A lot of noise street noise, very loud in the room. The bed was horrible. We only got a few hours sleep. The room was clean enough but not great. The staff was okay but the room was a disappointment.
0	Formally magnificent, recently overpriced. When this hotel first opened I adored it. I visited regularly and it became the benchmark of what a brilliant hotel should be. The decor was magnificent, the staff attentive and the little quirks throughout the hotel (including free calls to the UK), really made for a 5 star experience. My recent stay however, not so, and that's because the... More

Walking distance to Union Square and other landmarks with ease.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for sharing your review of your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco.

0	Declined. Will not return to this hotel. I have stayed here in the past and is has not been too bad. This time the quality has declined. Found a lot of bugs in room, outside of building is in sever disrepair, mirror in my room is not even hung on wall, but leaning against the wall on while.sitting on the dresser. Dresser is missing a drawer. TV is VERY out dated, and has very grainy picture. Beds look like they are from the 80's, walls covered in marks. Burn marks by light, light is almost falling off wall. Best item in the room is the A/C unit.Just stay away
0	Hilton name is apparently meaningless. In the last few months, I've stayed at three different Hilton properties for work... and the Hilton Garden Inn in Rancho Bernardo, CA is a disappointment. Less well cared for than their sister brand Hampton Inn. And as a HiltonHonors member, they refused to give me a free bottle of water after the check-in for my 8 day stay. Wifi is sketchy. Parking and restaurant is substandard. Stay at a corporate rate at the nearby Rancho Bernardo Inn. So much more worth it!Also, light on mirror in bathroom has been out for a day and I just called down and the maintenance person on duty doesn't have access to the lightbulbs.I am very sorry that you did not have a good experience with us. I do appreciate your feedback and I will ensure I personally follow up to ensure we correct these issues. We truly appreciate your loyalty to the brand and are very disappointed that we fell short of your expectations. Please know that we take your feedback seriously and will improve. We hope that you will consider trying us again on a future stay.
1	Stayed the last weekend in February. Upon arrival we were greeted at the check in desk. He was very friendly and didn't waste anytime getting us on our way. We stayed on the 7th floor. The room was more like a suite. It had a king size bed and a sitting area that converted to a bed as well. The window overlooked the harbor in the distance and had a ceiling to floor window. Very modern room and hotel. Our room had a door, that conjoined to the neighboring room...this was the only flaw. I'm unsure if it was because of the conjoining door or thin walls, but we could hear everything they said and was a bit uneasy knowing they could hear us too. The hotel offers a continental breakfast. It was mediocre, like they all are. The setup was very nice and very clean. We didn't park at the hotel, 35 a night, instead we parked at the rear of the hotel. It was 3 a night in the public parking garage. This hotel is walking distance to Fells Point, Harbor East, Little Italy, and Inner Harbor. It is also under a 10 cab ride to Power Plant.
1	Sort stay before flight. Only there 7 hours since we head a real early flight. The employees are the nicest of anywhere I've stayed. Called early in the day with a question - happy to help. Checked in - smiles all around. Shuttle the next morning to the airport - again - as nixes as can be. We used stay and park or park and fly where we can leave our car there and the price is competitive. The only (not really a ) complaint is that the extended parking is a little ways - 2 minute walk - from the hotel. Not an issue unless you have trouble getting around (and they might help) or weather. I would do it again!Thank you so much for telling us about your recent experience at our hotel. We are so glad that you had a pleasant stay. We strive everyday to exceed our guest expectations. We look forward to serving you and your family in the future!Thank you for making it the Hampton Inn By Hilton Philadelphia Airport!Adrian Woods, Director of Sales
1	Jewel in Napa Valley. This hotel on the outskirts of Napa Valley provided an excellent base to tour this area. The staff were excellent and provided us with a lot of local information and recommendations for our specific requests. They provided us with a lot of options for our stay and were so friendly and informative. We would recommend this hotel purely on the standard of the reception staff.Dear 185robynp,Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. I'm so pleased you enjoyed our stay and our staff was able to help you with your plans around the valley. We hope to see you again soon. Cheers, Genafer

0	Dirty hotel in excellent location.. Dirty hotel room floor, the room was inside the building with the windows overlooking the hall and the rooms across the hall (how is this not a fire hazard!!!). The breakfast was cold, self-served a la carte in a dirty hall. Parking structure overcrowded. Awesome location.
0	Horrible. Horrible neighborhood and rooms were unclean
1	Wonderful stay. Had a fantastic stay at the Troubadour. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful with suggestions for restaurants. The hotel was clean and modern. The only negative was that the walls are very thin but didn't bother us too much. Everything else well surpassed my expectations. Thank you very much for the five star review!!! We love to hear that we exceeded just about all expectations which is our ultimate goal with all of our guests. Please know that our walls were actually built thicker than what was recommended for a hotel when we completed this renovation, may have been a case of noisy neighbors that we could always try to assist with once reported.We appreciate you staying with us and do hope to have you back for another visit real soon.Best regards,
1	How beautiful is this hotel. I am glad we finally got to have a meeting in hotel that is the epitome of elegance and service. The rooms, the fitness equipment, the catered meals, the staff all top line. My room had a wonderful view of the ATL skyline, and being attached to Lenox Square is always a plus. Our catered buffet lunches were superb, and the staff attached to our meetings were very amenable. We typically stay closer to the airport, but I am so very happy we came to Buckhead. I ate downstairs at the bar one night, and only OK food, but being as this hotel is so close to really good restaurants, it is not important to eat there, anyway.
1	Will definitely return!. Everyone was very friendly. The breakfast lady Sunday morning was more interested in talking to people then keeping bar filled and clean. She should be able to do both. I had a knee cart and she would see me trying to get around chairs and tables and just continued to talk to someone and did not help. I had surgery on my foot and needed a place with no stairs for few days. The room was comfortable, spacious and clean. I enjoyed the front porch to sit. Out during the day to get fresh air. Overall the stay was great. Would do it again just to get away for a couple days.

1	Great Location!. My boyfriend and I had a most excellent stay here! We checked in on this past Sunday and stayed until this Tuesday. From our arrival we were greeted by Benny, the Bell Captain who along with the rest of his Bell staff took care of us from go. We were allowed to check in early to a Junior Suite 102 which had a beautiful view of the Ocean located at the end of the street. Our suite was located out in a building separate from the main hotel and off the pool area. Just around the corner from the front desk. Our suite was large had a separate sitting area with a flat screen TV and a small fridge under the counter which had plenty of cabinet space. 2 sinks one in the bathroom and one in the counter where the fridge was. Luxurious Bathrobes that I ABSOLUTELY wanted (will put on my birthday list :) Bellman Dan scooted us over to a local restaurant in the hotel golf cart... they will offer to take you just about anywhere and will also return to pick you up.rnrnService at the Front Desk was exceptional, friendly, courteous and consistently above and beyond helpful! I commend who ever does the hiring here because they have done a Fantastic job of hiring people that either love their job and sincerely want you to enjoy your stay or they do a great job in faking it LOLrnrnHotel is located within walking distance of all the quaint shops, it has it's own restaurant but we were not impressed with the menu... we did however take advantage of the happy hour deal the appetizers were tasty and 1/2 off as was their signature cocktail Orange Crush. The day before the boyfriend ordered a Cloud 9 that was the BOMB! and I got my favorite Lemon Drop both were flavorful but I must say this was the only place I was not impressed with the Bar Service it took a while for our appetizers to arrive and they were not as attentive as the rest of the hotel staff had been /rnrnAll and all a very nice place to drop in during the week we get the impression that weekends here (like most places) are a zoo. Parking on the street down the hill is free so don't spend the 22.00 on valet just find a spot on the street.rnrnRespectfully Reviewedrn

0	No beach vacation here. I think this may be a homeless shelter.Needed an overnight in the area and just looked at a room. Couldn't stay there. Too bad because the location has potential.Nice guy at the desk and plenty of parking.
1	Perfectly nice hotel. I rarely write reviews but after reading some of the scathing reviews, and wanting to cancel my own reservation after reading them (but had booked a nonrefundable reservation), I wanted to make sure this sweet little hotel receives the credit it deserves. I just stayed one night, prior to a residency interview in SF, so to be fair, was only in the hotel to sleep.First of all, the front desk is incredibly accommodating and efficient. Check in was a breeze. I requested the quietest room, and the nice man at the front desk gave me a room on the top floor away from the supposedly noisy elevator. The lobby is perfectly nice, did not smell, and I was very comfortable sitting there waiting for my ubers. The room was clean, quiet and the bed was comfortable (and I am actually quite picky about springy mattresses). There are some homeless people across the street, but I was never bothered or approached by any of them. Honestly, if it upsets you to see homeless people, SF is probably not the city you want to visit. The only negative was that the hallway did have a mild odor, but my room was fine. Overall, you stay at this hotel to spend less than 100 on a room in a very expensive city. It is not a luxurious experience, but it is a perfectly comfortable place to spend a night and I would recommend it.Thank you so much Lauren for making an exception for us, and taking the time to write such a comprehensive review of your stay with us. We're delighted that you enjoyed your stay so much, and that you found us to be a reasonable, yet clean and comfortable hotel for your short stay. We sincerely hope that your residency interview went well - you might need to recommend somewhere for family and friends to come and visit you! Thank you again for your review, Best Regards, Hotel Management
1	Clean hotel in a good location. This hotel is in a great location especially if you are here with the family. It is across the freeway from mission bay park where there are places to play and relax. The hotel room was very clean but in serious need of an update. This is a reasonably priced hotel for the area. Parking is free and there is a great selection for the included breakfast. We have stayed at another resort hotel in San Diego and were charged for parking per day and resort fees per day and the resort room was not that much nicer so in comparison this place was a steal. My only complaints would be the noise. We were on the first floor and could hear everything going on in the parking lot. It was pretty quiet at night so getting a good night sleep wasnt an issue. I would stay here again, hopefully next time the rooms are updated. Thank you very much for the review. We do have a renovation that may start during the Fall. Very sorry for the noise pollution.
1	Great deal for the price. I needed an affordable hotel close to Fort Story. The Hampton Inn was perfect. The bed was very comfortable. The toiletries in the bathroom were of high quality, Neutrogena. anytime we needed anything (extra towels, paper plates for the pizza we had delivered, etc.) the staff was quick to help us. And having a hot breakfast with lots of options was great, too. There is an outdoor pool, but I did not use it. There is also a small workout room with a treadmill, an elliptical trainer, and a stationary bike, as well as weights. The neighborhood is very quiet, with a 7-11, Ruby Tuesday's, and a Rite Aid within walking distance. Freeway access was also very easy from there.
0	Watch Out for This One. I initially reserved a room, on my own, at the Knights Inn Market Center in Dallas, Texas. The booking was completely unprofessional, with errors in the booking info. This was corrected after a couple of emails. I then inquired of the cancellation policy. The explanation was first, and I quote, before 24 hours. After inquiring of the meaning of that statement, they modified it to after 24 hours!!! Complete and utter incompetence. This was in the month of January, and my reservation was in April. I then noted the charges for the room appear on my credit card statement in January!!!! I then realized the level of incompetence, and wondered if fraud may be involved. A phone call to the Inn put me in contact with a young lady, who couldn't even find a record of my reservation. She was eventually helpful in finding it and reversing the charge to my account. She also clarified verbally the cancellation policy, which was the standard prior to 24 hours before the date of the stay. After all this, I emailed about a week ago, asking them to cancel my reservation, and confirm by email. No response, so sent a second email asking again for confirmation. No response. I have again emailed, to the attention of the young lady who helped in the past, requesting confirmation of my cancellation. Ed WooleverHello Mr. Woolever, I apologize that you had some issues with your reservation. According to our records which were emailed to you upon your request, your reservation was booked for January 21st, since you failed to checkin on January 21st you were charged for the first night. When you called us to inform us about the charge and your intention to book the room on April 21st, we thought of it as a miscommunication and as a courtesy reversed the charges immediately. Later you emailed us with your intention to cancel the room for April 21st, I emailed you back requesting you to call me for the cancellation (as it is a standard protocol for most hotel reservation cancellation to get a verbal authorization), which you called and canceled within 10 minutes. We sincerely apologize for the initial date mismatch and the charge, I hope we can go pass that and you would give us an opportunity to show you our commitment to customer service by staying with us. If there is anything I can do to persuade you to change your decision please give us a call. Thank you for your feedback, your feedback is very valuable to us since it helps us improve our services.
1	Great stay before after a cruise. Went to Orlando to go on a cruise. We arrived a day early to avoid any issues making the boat. We arrived at the hotel before the room was ready but that was not a problem. We were given access to the pool and our luggage stored for us. Within 30 min I was notified of our room being ready. On our stay post-cruise it was another great experience. We had access to the pool and our room was ready, immediately. The hotel was within walking distance of at least 15 places to eat ranging from fast food to nice sit down. Please accept my appreciation for your wonderful feedback regarding both your stays at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport. I am so pleased that you had a wonderful experience before and after your cruise and our location was perfect for your needs as well. Our associates pride themselves in providing excellent quality in their service to guests so your comments tell me that we are on target in meeting our service goals. Thank you for your nice review. We hope that you will visit again soon. Sincerely,Michael GoldwasserGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport
0	Did not deliver.... We had special reservation request at the time of booking and our request was granted over the phone - however upon arrival they did not deliver. Bedding had funny smell too :( I would recommend another hotel if traveling through Brownsburg.....
1	Unexpectedly nice. We wanted downtown Seattle and this hotel was far less than anything else and close to the light rail. When we found out that it was formerly the hospital hotel for visitors, my wife wanted to change the reservation, but never did.It was a short but steep walk from the light rail. The rooms were newly decorated. We got a free upgrade. The beds and linens were very nice and comfy. Since it is on the budget side of the highway, there were all sorts of reasonably priced restaurants nearby. And it is a short walk to the waterfront.We'd stay there again.Good Morning David. Thank you for your comments - I particularly enjoyed your review and learning that we surprized you! We are very proud to be part of the Virginia Mason Medical Center campus - recently voted one of the top 10 medical facilities in the country. We look forward to welcoming you again when your travels bring you back to Seattle. Until then, safe travels!
1	Second Stay. Ok, I can't vouch for a great nights sleep. I live in the Middle East and had just flown in from France, and slept out of sheer desperation for sleep, but jet lag reared it's ugly head about 5AM. I must say that it was an amazingly comfortable bed. My check in experience was wonderful, and check out was just as easy. The room was clean and comfortable. This was my second stay at this property and I would stay here again without hesitation.Next time you stay with us please ask for me, I would love to hear about the Middle East and the experiences you have to share if you dont mind. I will also share your comments with the front desk staff, in my opinion they are the best.. thank you for choosing us when you returned to the US
0	Friendly staff dirty room. Staff was friendly and informative... However... Room was a little dirty. Curtains were severly stained and carpet was filthy. Walked around with socks and within a few steps to the bathroom socks were black. Smelled humid and hallway was dirty.
1	Lovely boutique hotel. My wife and I stayed here for three nights in April, coming from Victoria on the Clipper. The hotel was very conveniently located, just four blocks from the ferry terminal. We were met by Lee, who was very courteous, and very helpful with suggestions and directions for sightseeing and restaurants. The room was very nice, and very quiet. We enjoyed happy hour in the lobby, and we had one dinner in the restaurant downstairs. The ambience is very retro. The front-desk and cleaning staff were wonderful. We could do all of the sightseeing we wanted on foot. Chihuly Garden and Glass was a highlight. Highly recommended.Dear Guest,Thank you for this fantastic review! Our location really is ideal for 'on-foot' sightseeing of the Chihuly Museum/Space Needle as well the Pike Place Market. Nice when we are perfectly placed in the middle of these two iconic spots! Your kudos for Lee are so appreciated as well. We pride ourselves on making guests feel as if they've traveled to a home away from home, so it would be our greatest honor to welcome you back as our guests again in the future. Please feel free to reach out to me directly when you consider your next trip to Seattle :)Best Regards,David Bayley
0	You get what you pay for.. Pros: All of the hotel staff were friendly, check-in and out process was quick, day time parking is good, bed was clean and comfortable. Cons: We stayed in room 207. We paid for 3 nights but only stayed for 2. The bathroom ceiling tiles are molded and falling apart, the shower curtain was covered in mold, the TV had... More
1	Classy hotel great location but avoid rip off mini bar!. Very nice hotel and room in perfect location. Front desk staff polished and smart. Only downside was that Jose in particular really didn't want to do any more than the bare minimum for us when asked to, which was a shame as it tainted our view of the hotel. Kimpton are guilty of shamelessly ripping their customers off with a 12 dollar charge for 2 bottles of water left in our room. Would love to hear them justify that, but that's a minor point and all in all this is a good hotel with a nice pool area too.Dear UK Guest Thank you very much for the positive comments on our hotel and location and more we truly value the loyalty of our guests and recognize the investment you make in selecting our hotel among so many options in San Diego. I am sorry that a member of our staff was not responsive to your needs and expectations we review our guest surveys and comments weekly and I assure you that your feedback will discussed. Perceptions are a hard reality and our team needs this information to better understand how to improve our guest service experiences. This same feedback and information also allows us to review our operations and processes including the sale of bottled water in our guest rooms. The cost is noted on the cap but we do understand that this might be overlooked. Solamar hopes to see you back soon!Best regards, Mark DibellaGeneral Manager
1	Great Location and Amenities. We stayed at Hotel Zephyr with our two kids ages 8 and 12 back in February. We loved all this hotel has to offer, both in location and fun amenities. We loved the dart board in our hotel room and have looked everywhere for one like it for our own home. The game room, patio and all the fun places to sit and relax are fantastic. They didn't seem to have any board games etc...but there was plenty to do with shuffle board, ping pong etc. We hope to come back again in a year or two. Thanks Hotel Zephyr!!Greetings jam0nes,You are most welcome. Thank you for sharing your amazing memories of your stay at Hotel Zephyr. We have added several new games to the game room since February, come back and see us again...hopefully sooner than a year or two.
1	Great location, laid back but modern vibe. Stayed here for 1 night with my 2 children. It was a great location within walking distance of a lot of attractions. The rooftop pool was very nice, well maintained and was not crowded when we were there. The staff, especially at the front desk and valet, was very friendly and attentive. I would definitely stay there again. The only downside, which is typical of all hotels in that area, is the parking situation. Valet is really your only option and it's 49/night.Thanks for the great review, Marie F. I'm really happy to see you and your kids enjoyed the stay. We hope to see you back again soon. Justin Gentry- GM
1	Great value, friendly staff. We spent almost a week here and really appreciated the convenience and value. With your stay, you get a free breakfast, an early evening snack which is pretty much a meal, three free drinks per person per night, a rooftop swimming pool and jacuzzi and close proximity to much in New Orleans. Staff is friendly and helpful. Nightly rates will vary according to season, holidays and days of the week, but we were greatly satisfied with what we paid. Look for deals online. Our room wa well-appointed, classy and comfortable. This hotel will only get better after all renovations are complete. That they accept pets makes it all the better.
0	Worst experience ever!!!!!. I am not the kind of person who would write reviews, but this time I have to, this is the worst place I've ever stayed in my life, the room smelled, was too mosit and had a lot of small flies. Overall everything is just disgusting, Worst experience ever!!!!!
0	Good location overshadowed by run down, dirty facility poor staff.. We booked this facility because of the good location, the pictures online the description we got over the phone. It did not deliver! Management is very poor.r The facility is dirty. The meeting room is in a basement (with the 'weight room' a smelly, dirty, unusable kitchen bathroom.) they should be ashamed of the condition of this place what they charge. There are actually many 'long term' guests that reside there from what we could tell as well.r r Not the plac...view moree for a good nights rest in a clean room. Look elswhere.view less
1	Decent. Plenty of electrical outlets in room. Beds comfortable but not as good as Holiday Inn Express and Marriott chain. Hotels in this price range offer free breakfast - they offer 11.95 buffet. Sometimes, you dont want all this Buffet food. Clean and staff friendly. For this visit, they offered the best rate for a Airport hotel in this class.Thank you for choosing the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport for your recent accommodations. It is a delight to read you both found us to be a good value and had a nice stay in our comfortable room. It was a pleasure hosting you and on behalf of everyone here, we invite you to stay with us again the next time you visit Orlando. Sincerely,Michael GoldwasserGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport
0	Hotel is nice, you don't get what you're promised. We made reservations well over a month prior. However, after a long drive a two tired kids we were informed at check in that they were out of double beds. I get they made a lot of $ from a large group but we paid too! Could not care less either. Lier would be one word to describe this service
1	Great place- nice people!. During our recent stay in Las Vegas, NV we stayed at the Suncoast Resort and Casino. The room was very large with a great view of the golf course (had to pay extra for the view!). The maid was very nice and friendly. We ate at three of the restaurants that are onsite. Good food and a very fair price. There is a movie theater onsite. We went to a movie and was surprised at the size and comfort! Nice! The resort is close to the red rocks. To top off our trip, one of us won a royal flush. Loved our visit-great room, comfortable bed, nice view, quiet, and very welcoming.
0	Graduation. The manager Jasmine, needs to get training in customer service! I tried to explain our issues and when trying to get things straight and show her my email confirmations for the booking and pricing she would not listen or even look at what I was trying to show her. I booked my rooms two months out for the graduation weekend.... More
1	perfect place. Perfect location with easy access to all of San Diego and free shuttle. Surrounded by palm trees, great hot tubs and pool, friendly, accommodating staff, excellent food, Zack's bar is cozy and fun, room is comfortable with everything you need.Dear Christopher E.,Thank you for your nice comments regarding your recent stay! We're thrilled that you found our hotel to be the perfect place to stay when visiting San Diego. We're glad you enjoyed our complimentary shuttle service as well as our friendly and accommodating staff and our many amenities including our pool and hot tubs. We're also happy to hear that you were pleased with your experience at our onsite restaurant, the Seven Seas Cafe, and our cozy Zack's Bar. Thank you for mentioning our comfortable and well-appointed rooms. We hope to see you again on your next trip to San Diego! Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management Staff
1	Good Value for SPG Users. The hotel is about 5 minutes from the Orlando International Airport, so it's very convenient to stay for an overnight before taking a flight. In addition, it's only 3,000 SPG points (weekends), so you don't have to use up a lot of points on your stay. What you get is a nice sized suite, complimentary internet, and a decent night's sleep. There aren't a lot of perks for Starwood Preferred Guests like in other Sheraton hotels, but it's a good value nonetheless. There's an indoor/outdoor pool, a nice fitness center and lots of restaurant options within walking distance. The restaurant in the Sheraton was a little overpriced and room service was extremely overpriced. Other than that, the shuttle drivers were very friendly, as was the staff.
1	AWESOME!. I came to town for a conference. Although I wasn't super close to the event (due to last minute planning and lots of local events going on that week) I was completely satisfied. Initially, I was so upset to find that the Hilton was booked and my travel agent was trying to sell me on the Hampton Inn. I was forced to take this room. And after all the whining and complaining, I ended up loving it. I came in very late after visiting friends in LA. it seemed very SECLUDED, dark and a little scary. But once I got to the hotel I realized it was clean, up to date, stylish, trendy and the staff was extremely nice and accommodating. I was able to earn Hilton Honor rewards points. The breakfast was FREE and actually pretty good. Housekeeping was thorough and kept my room well stocked. While staying there for 4 days, I've came across several staff members, all just as nice, and helpful as the next. I would say I received just as good of service and the room was just about as nice as the Hilton Pasadena that I had just spent the previous nights at. But with this hotel i paid slightly less, i didn't have to pay for parking (but missed the valet) and did I say FREE breakfast. No stale donuts. I'm talking fresh pastries, hot and cold cereal, eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, waffle maker, fresh fruit and assorted juices and more. AMAZING! I would stay here again if I had to come back.
0	Bugs and hot. This was a terrible experience our room had nats and spiders in it. It smelled and the Air conditioned was filthy and did not work. It was disgusting and in need of renovation. I needed a new room and they did not want to accommodate me wanted to send maintenance, No way I already was late for our tour. After about 40 minutes they sent the manager who was absent every time I asked for him. And of course no one could help except him. He finally offered a new old room that smelled but the ac work. We had to move and of course had no time to get ready for our 515 tour. I will be contacting the hotel management to discuss this overpriced horrible experience not the local manager he never called me he didn't like me much after I told the folks checking in check their rooms for bugs!Thank you for your recent review. On behalf of our entire team, we would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. We appreciate that you have brought this area of concern to our attention. Rest assured, each guestroom is routinely deep cleaned and treated with commercial grade steamers as a preventative measure. The Best Western Seven Seas is an older property however, we are continually upgrading our guestrooms, exterior, and other amenities in order to meet the needs of our guests. It is our hope that you will consider staying with us again so that we can provide you with a superior experience. Thank you.
0	Gnat infestation. Gnats in room, I had bites all over my body and due to spraying of raid had a severe chemical reaction to my lungs. The walk ways should have been posted slippery due to sprinkler, someone could have had a serious fall. Table by pool area filthy. Mgr Scott was rude regarding my situation!!!! Will not recommend!!!! Food prices in hotel very high.
1	Good place to stay if you don't want to spend a lot. My family of 4 stayed here for one night in New Orleans. We were looking for a nice place that was near major tourist attractions and didn't cost a lot - as we were just passing through on the way to our vacation. This Drury worked out nicely.It was easy to find from I-10 - near the SuperDome and close enough to French Quarter that we could walk - even in the heat of July. Having said that, I did have the impression that it was closer. We walked to Canal St and the Riverwalk - several blocks and then worked our way back through a couple of FQ streets to find a spot for dinner. It was a LOT of walking. After dinner, we caught a cab (for less than 10) back to the hotel. We spent the evening in the rooftop pool. It was fairly small, but adequate. Our room had beautiful tall windows and ceilings, making quite a first impression. The beds were comfortable. The parking lot side of the building was rather loud because of the frequent passing by of the streetcar (this streetcar went to the Garden District, I think). Parking was 15 - a bargain compared to most of the hotels I looked at, and it was self park. You needed your room key to get in/out of the lot, but could come and go as you please. Much easier than valet, in my opinion.Breakfast was nothing special. We found the area crowded and the selection very limited. We ate a small bite and stopped at Cafe du Monde for beignets later in the morning. We would stay here again under the same circumstances, but if you are planning a longer stay or want a hotel with more of a NO feel, Le Pavillion is right across the street and is beautiful. Hotel Monteleone was a little closer to things and was the most beautiful hotel I saw. We paid an internet price of approx 80 (+tax) and 15 for parking.
0	terrible king size bed. 2 things are mandatory for a good hotel stay. 1. that the place is clean, and this was. 2. that the bed be comfortable and this WAS NOT!! It was a struggle to not roll into the divot that was in the center of the mattress. Both my husband and I had a terrible nights sleep.
1	GREAT service. Front desk personnel JP Robinson and Charles Stephens were most helpful. All phases of this stay were taken care of with NO hesitation or problems. I heartily recommend this hotel and would stay here again as it is most conveniently located.Wow! We appreciate your wonderful feedback about your stay at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport. We are delighted to know that you had a great time with us and that you liked our convenient location and that our front desk associates took great care of you. I will surely pass on your kind words to Robinson for the great job done. Thank you for recommending us and we will be waiting to host you again soon!All the Best,Charles StephensAssistant General ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando International Airport
0	Not what I expected. I thought that this was going to be a very nice hotel. The beds were so hard that all of us had backaches. The sign going in from the parking lot said that the doors would be locked at dusk and we would need to use our room card to get in. This never happened. The doors stayed unlocked the... More

When we searched for hotels we found the coconut waikiki hotel which seemed to look good on pictures. Once we arrived we got a whole other opinion about the hotel. Staff was not friendly, rooms were old fashioned, pool was very small.. But the worst thing of all is... More
0	Meeting Place. Ice machine broken, telephone broken, ice bucket dirty, run down hotel, overall stinky ordor, great customer service and guest services I would not recommend my enemies to this hotel..Please renovate soon.
0	No sleep in San Diego. All night street and airplane noise ruined my San Diego stay. Decent mattress but hard pillows-telephone and TV not working and toilet running nonstop! Nice pool and jacuzzi and free parking can't make up for no sleep. Cancelled 2nd night. Busy harbor area somewhat walk-able . Run the other way! Pay an extra 20 a night at some place decent.I would like to apologize for the inconvenience.Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you gave us to implement improvements to ensure we offer a better experience for guests in the future. I hope that you will consider staying with us again so that we can have another chance to provide you with a superior experience.
0	A poor showing for a night at Days inn. The carpet was so dirty that we had to where socks and still clean our feet. The Sheets for the bed felt like sandpaper and the shower never gave hot water. Cannot recommend staying here to anyone.
1	First Time in San Francisco. The reviews of hotel are what led us to stay here. The staff was friendly and very helpful.As with everything in San Francisco it was expensive but the hotel lived up to its good reviews and was close enough to walk or ride cable car or F train to most destinations. We used shuttle from airport to hotel and never needed a car. The location is right in front of China town so very easy access and a coffee and bagel shop on every corner so quick breakfast is no problem. We stayed here on the tail end of a Maui vacation and wished we had just stayed in Maui. But this is no fault of hotel just personal preference on more relaxing vacation in Maui as compared to having to rush from point to point in San Francisco. Also Maui much more affordable that San Francisco, never would have thought that. Hotel great if this is the type vacation you desire. Great staffDear Mark,Thank you for choosing to stay with the Orchard Garden Hotel. I am pleased to find that you found our team very friendly and helpful. Our location is positioned perfectly to walk to a lot of the attractions. China Town being one since we are located right at the gates, and Union Square where there are lots of shops and restaurants in walking distance. Being in our prime location does help save on the extra expense of transportation one might occur if staying at a different property.Overall, Mark it seems you did enjoy the hotel and the service provided. If you are ever back in San Francisco we do hope you choose Orchard Garden Hotel.Thanks again,Bruce PinckneyFront Office ManagerOrchard Garden Hotel
0	Spend the extra money!. I didn't expect Ceasar's Palace but also didn't expect a view of prostitutes and drug dealers directly outside my window. The staff was rude,the room smelled, the elevator was a thrill ride and the indoor pool was an outdoor pool due to the recent collapse of the roof. Given the choice of sleeping on the beach or this hotel I would take the beach!
0	To sleep leave the lugage, and leaving to visit SF. Dirty sensation. Carpet full of cigarrettes holes. Very old and used. Very noisy AC. Free parking. Thick walls, you listen your neighbourgs snoring. The are is nice, bacause you have some bars around and the neighbouhood is suitable. Near Fillmore Street (genuine american, San Francisco Street, full of live, no tourists).If your budget is low, and you are not very ambitious with the room, is one the cheapest way to stay in SF. Leave you lugage and go to visit the city.
1	Best Concierge EVER!. The Concierge, David Moore, was above and beyond accomodating and welcoming to set me up with everything I needed for my work trip. He was miraculously familiar with the nature of my work and my recent health condition, and I was touched and delighted to find that while I was out, he tailored our room to accomodate my special needs so that I could thrive, personally and professionally, during my stay at the Kimpton Allegro. I look forward to staying there again during my next visit, and I hope he gets a magnificent raise before then. Also, the beds and bathrobes were supremely comfortable. 3Hello! We truly appreciate you taking the time to write this review about your stay. I am thrilled to hear that David gave you a spectacular experience and we are so proud to have him as part of our team! I will be sure to pass along your feedback to him. We hope to welcome you back soon to provide you with another great stay!
1	Great location, good hotel. The location, just on the verge of French Quarter with 5-minute walk to its center sells this htel easily. But it has also more to offer - quaint insides and nice architecture, a very nice pool, breakfasts slightly better than all other motels and a good service. The price is OK for New Orleans and this location, though you have to pay additionally for th parking. Overall I had a great experience.Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. We are so please you were able to enjoy our prime location and our amenities. We hope you will come back and stay again soon.

With so many choices here in center city Philadelphia, we greatly appreciate your business and look forward to welcoming you back soon, until then...With Hospitality,Jason Bloom General ManagerHome2 Suites by HiltonYour Second Home Away From Home
1	Perfect place outside of town.. Greeted at check-in. Had to have an extra 25 held on my credit card in case of damages () - had to sign a No Party policy - that was a first. Room was clean and pleasant. Bed was clean and bathroom was clean. Breakfast was a bit hap-hazard in that the line was incredibly long to obtain a made-to-order omelette. Nice provisions for the breakfast. Set up was good. Food was better than I expected and they offered healthy choices for breakfast including yogurt, fresh fruit, oatmeal. I would stay again. I felt safe and the place was maintained well.
1	Very comfortable and well-equipped, but a little noisy. Everything was clean, fairly updated, nice. The hotel was easy to get to from 75 and 285. We had a small couch, microwave, and mini fridge. We used the iron, safe, and hair dryer all without hiccups. The king bed in our room was so comfortable- I think memory foam, maybe And the pillows were not just big hard marshmallows but able to be fluffed and shaped a little. Breakfast was decent- scrambled eggs, sausage links, waffles, juice, coffee, cereal, fruit, yogurt, bread and bagels. Our only complaint was that the road noise from 285 was quite noticeable. We had a 4th floor room in the back, on the same end of the building as the pool. I think it would have been even louder on the front of the building though! Also when people flushed their toilets in other rooms, we could hear them. Didn't hear anyone's TVs or voices through the walls. Not sure if that's a function of the hotel or its guests that night though. We would stay here again, but maybe bring ear plugs, or request a different room, or try to run the fan on the heat/ac unit to provide some white noise.Thank you for taking the time to post comments on Trip Advisor about our location. We understand it takes time to post comments and feedback online. We review all feedback and comments in our weekly staff meeting.

1	Excellent Service. Stayed here on business and it was the perfect hotel. The staff was extremely helpful and attentive. They booked me reservations at different restaurants and they have a shuttle that will take you anywhere within two miles, and pick you up! They have a good fitness center, a nice lobby bar, and a caf in the lobby. It's the perfect place to stay for business because they have everything you need right there.It was a little pricy but I think there was a conference going on while I was there.Thank you for post. I am happy you found our staff helpful and attentive. We strive to anticipate our guests needs so it is reassuring to learn when we accomplish our aspirations. You mentioned you were here on business and it was perfect for your needs. We have some great weekend rates and packages and might find it a perfect hotel for that weekend getaway too. We are so convenient to many of the restaurants and attractions, not to mention connected to Lenox Square Mall which makes us a perfect destination to unwind. Hope to see you soon for business or pleasure!
0	UNCLEAN ROOM - DIRTY. The exterior of the building looks very nice...the rooms don't feel that way however. There was chipped counters and mismatched furniture. For what I paid I should have had a better set up. This place is gross and I will never stay there again.
0	Horrible. Horrible, the beds were like bricks and lacked comfort.
0	Not happy. Bed were made poorly, cigarette ashes in bathroom floor. Over all a sloppy sleepless stay.
0	Expected more for the price.. Location not as convenient as originally thought.  Still had to drive to dinner.  Pool is fairly small and seems a long hike from most rooms.  Very nice lobby, only two clerks for check in at 5:00 on a Saturday.  In the future I'll stay downtown or somewhere else.  Disappointed that Wi-Fi and parking were so expensive.  The parking garage two blocks away was free though.
1	Great place to stay for Georgia Tech activities. This hotel met the bill for everything we needed to do for our visit. It's right on the edge of the GT campus and directly across from the campus bookstore (lots of swag available) it's within walking distance of a MARTA stop, and the busy downtown Peachtree/Centennial area is about a mile away, which translates into a quick taxi ride or one subway stop away. The area felt safe, and the hotel was clean and the staff pleasant. It's not a luxury hotel, but the price is among the best in the area.Thank you for the nice review. Our location lends itself to a variety of attractions, local restaurants, sporting venues and of course our location on the GT campus is unmatched in the market. We are delighted you enjoyed your visit with us and will share your comments with all of our team members.
1	We loved it!!!. The location was perfect for us. Away from the Bourbon St noise and convenient to pick up the tours we had booked from home. Always within walking distance of where we needed to be. I loved hearing the calliope on the steamship in the evening. The staff was always friendly, courteous and greeted us by name. The room was very comfortable. We had a king sundeck room. But our outdoor table and chairs were missing so we didn't get the chance to sit outdoor and just chill. The other 3 sundeck rooms had the table and chairs. Breakfast was average but at least it was there and available in the morning. I wish we had more time to spend in New Orleans. Now, at least I know where to book our room next time we visit. I would definitely book Bienville House again.We are so glad you enjoyed your stay at Bienville House and took the time to share your great experience with TripAdvisor. It sounds like the perfect trip! Please return soon to Bienville House for another great trip!
1	Nice hotel, great location. I came for a conference, paid 30 for an upgrade to a corner suite (when reserving), well worth it. Living room, separate bedroom, large bathroom and closet. Great location at the east side of downtown by convention center, near the freeway, light rail to the airport (and underground stations for downtown buses), and Capitol Hill. Room was quiet, clean internet 9.95 a day. Hotel was modern decor, lots of wood, pleasant atmosphere. Ruth Chris is in the lobby, very good for lunch (didn't have breakfast or dinner there, so many other good choices nearby). Would definitely consider staying here again (though I'm a SPG Platinum elite).
1	Solid Option. This was my first experience of a Hampton Inn. Check in was easy and efficient. Some of the staff were more easy going than others but overall they conducted themselves professionally and courteously. My room was a King studio. The bed was super comfortable for me. Space was adequate as a solo traveller attending a conference. The breakfast was good and varied over the 5 days I was there. Wifi was solid and quick. I had a car and was able to park underneath the hotel. Parking spaces were good. Parking was secured after 7pm. There is a local Taco Bell and petrol station nearby. There is a Vons and other shops down the road about 3 minutes. The views of the freeway was uninspiring but the noise was not intrusive. Overall, I had a good stay and if in the area again, I would be happy to stay here again.
1	Old charm hotel across from Louis Armstrong Park. Great location and great service...Beautiful courtyard with a pool, fountain, and serene sitting areas..Daily breakfast with traditional eggs, sausages, cereals, oatmeal etc. We stayed there 4 nights and were feeling at home.. Friendly and very knowledgeable staff, swift taxi services offered ( if required).. Hotel is older but do not get taken aback by that: this is New Orleans and this hotel fits right in..It is romantic and slightly decadent.. If you are looking for top notch modernity, you are in a wrong city...Surrounding area is safe to walk at night just be aware of your surroundings and do not walk alone ( usual principles of walking at night in many other cities in the world)...I am so happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay at our hotel. Our staff takes our Best Western Mantra of stay with people who care to heart. We truly do care about all of our guests and try to make each and everyone feel as if they are part of our family.We look forward to seeing you again on your next trip to NOLA.Robert K., Manager on Duty
0	Our confirmed reservation was cancelled day of check in because we were the last ones to check in due overbooking. I have never written a review, good or bad, but the experience at Hampton from their staff especially Kalah was so atrocious that I felt the need to prewarn people about this particular employee who was rude, unprofessional and argumentative and when I called to inform the manager of the experience, I received no calls back. The hotel overbooks and apparently doesn't care.Dear Cinandyoung,Thank you for taking the time to express yourself about your experience with the Hampton Inn Suites. As we always try to do our best given the circumstances and situation at hand. I apologize that we fell short in being able to accommodate you as our guest. I appreciate your feed back and will turn this situation into a learning lesson on how we can handle this situation better next time. I thank you again for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We hope you give us the opportunity to make this stay up on you next trip to Napa Valley. Thank you again, Serina Najar.
0	Poor housekeeping. We stayed at the Hyatt House because it was convenient to the EMP, as we were taking a vocal workshop. The room had greasy fingerprints all over the microwave, chairs around the bar were askew, and the shower was dirty with large spots of soap scum all over it. We called the front desk and they asked if they could clean it the next day! We said, no, we are checking out then and want to take a shower in the morning. They said they would send someone up. I pulled back the covers on the bed to make sure the sheets had been changed and there was a plastic wrapper and a dirty wash rag. Needless to say, we went downstairs and said, please put us in another room. The next room was not very clean either, but better than the first one.kimbrleedo,Feedback from our guests is very important to us and we appreciate the detailed concerns. We strive to exceed all of our guests expectations and know we still have some work to do. Please know this is extremely important to me and I'm working with my Executive Housekeeper to correct any issues. Please let us know if there is anything we further assist with - we look forward to another opportunity to serve you in the future.Sarah Junge
1	Excellent Stay Dennis was the best!!. Clean comfortable hotel. Dennis the shuttle driver provided a tour into Newport and back to the hotel that was better than paid tours in Boston and Manhattan we have been on. He was the highlight of our trip. We are frequent visitors to Newport but never knew the history. We learned the different neighborhoods and restaurant choices other than harbor side. Breakfast on his recommendation was great! The free breakfast at Hampton is not why we stay there. The cleanliness and security is the most important feature to us. Someone needs to recognize Dennis for his efforts!! We will be back because of this A1 service.Thank you for taking the time to share your experience at our hotel with the TripAdvisor community. We appreciate your kind words and compliments regarding the cleanliness, comfort and security of our location. I will be certain to share your accolades with Dennis who will be thrilled to receive them. He is a tremendous asset to our team. We look forward to having you as our guests again upon your return to Newport. Again, thank you for your feedback.
1	Quality Columbia MD Hotel. My lady and I occasionally enjoy overnight stays in hotels. We don't have a lot of money and hotels aren't cheap, so I'm very selective about where we stay. I selected Sonesta because it was close hey 97 and a short drive to Arumdal Mills Mall. I've been previously disappointed choosing familiar brand name hotels in Baltimore. I've learned that brands don't guarantee quality. I wasn't familiar with Sonesta but I figured the hotel had to be good because of the location. I didn't have a clue. Out of all the hotels I've visited within the past 2 years, this is the best. I could LIVE there. EVERYTHING was excellent.
0	Pass this hotel up for something nicer. Hotel was only worth the 50 that we paid through Priceline. The agent that checked us in was rude and didn't want to be bothered. We were in town for the USC/ Alabama game and flew in early Saturday, due to our schedules. We arrived at the hotel at 9am, requested early check in, the agent didn't even look down and said Check in wasn't till 3p I asked if we were able to get an early check in to the reply we can try for 2p at the earliest she didn't even look down at the computer to see if a room was available. After asking if anything was open now, she was able to find an available room. I have worked in hotels for 10 years, and know that rooms are open if you don't sell out the night before which they didn't. Since our flight was early that morning we decided to rest before heading to the stadium, only to be woken by the housekeeper wanting to inspect the room. Hotel in general is dark and gloomy, halls feel cold and hotel looks like a bad 80s hotel. Watch out for platform bed edges at night, I have a huge bruise due to running into the corner when getting up in the middle of the night. Do yourself a favor and pass up this hotel and spend the money on something nicer.Thank you for your most recent stay. We take great pride providing the highest level of service, guest safety and cleanliness. As you know from working in hotels, we can never guarantee an early check in but will do our best in our attempts to make accommodations for guests wanting to check in early. With that in mind, while we may not have sold every room the night before, reservations are often made for specific room types for a reason and we may have not had your specific room type available at such an early hour as checkout is not until 12 PM. We were indeed sold out for the weekend of the game and our team did their best to get the rooms turned as quickly as possible. Hopefully we will see you again for the next game.
1	I recommend it !. Stayed there for a week. Friendly staff, clean rooms and bathrooms they clean twice a day.I could say it is located in the heart of SF. Right next to Chinatown Gate, few blocks from Union Square, and Market Street, and Embarcadero.Nice and quiet at night, for good sleep.We sincerely appreciate you recommending us and for sharing your experience. I am thrilled to read you enjoyed your one week visit. It sounds like you took advantage of the location and ventured out to see San Francisco. I am also pleased to hear the staff and rooms were to your liking. Our housekeeping team works diligently to insure rooms are spic-n-span during and in between visits. We look forward to the next time you come to the West Coast.Kind regardsQuinn McEnteeFront Office Manager
0	Flee infested!. The room looked clean from first impression, but there were flees everywhere. Our room was supposed to be no let's allowed. If no pets are allowed there should not have been flees. We only stayed one night, but by the time we left, my husband and I both had flee bites all over our legs.
1	A Lovely place to stay. All my negatives about this hotel will be about the bathroom, other than that it was very good. It is the old Radisson Hotel that has just had a massive upgrade. The hotel staff are friendly and helpful and the hotel is bright and airy. The courtyard outside is excellent of an evening with lovely places to sit and games for kids and adults. In the reception area, again is a lovely large area for people to chill out and the games room is again for kids and adults alike. The rooms and big, very comfortable and the beds some of the best i have had in a hotel. However, the bathroom falls down for me. You have a mssive bathroom and no shelf space to put toiletries or even the bathh towels which are kept in the wardrobe. There is so much space to put a few small shelves the bathroom is just wasted. Again in the shower area there rae no shelving at all to hang toiletries. The bathhroom door again is a massive negative and be very careful closing it from the inside as the handles are so close to the edge you will catch your fingers.The bathroom is just a small negative for me as it we stayed in San Francisco again we would definately stay here. It's dissapointing there isn't a small bar area or breakfast area but again that is very minor as you have Johnny Rockets attached to the hotel that is more than suitable for breakfast.Overall a very good hotel right on Fishermans Wharf with just a few minor irritations and we would 100 stay here again.Hi Davek200000,Thank you very much for taking the time to write about your stay at Zephyr!Yes, we had a massive upgrade! 32 million were spent to create our new phenomenal hotel!I am so glad to hear you were able to enjoy all the fun offerings we have between our game room and our yard! You said it right! all our life size games and cool fun is not only for kids but also for adults! We all say, Zephyr is like an adult playground! but we are so happy the kids are really enjoying it too!Davek2000000, we also agree with you in regards to our bathrooms.I can happily report that we have actually started installing shelving in them! I have also more great news coming your way...yes! the yard at Zephyr will be offering great food and beverage options very soon! You definitely have to come back to enjoy them!We hope to see you back soon!Warm regards,Carmen CruzGeneral Manager
1	Great Hotel!. We had a great experience at River Hotel. Due to airline issues, we arrived at 1:00 am, and they held our room for us and even gave us a river view at our request upon arrival. They gave us restaurant recommendations and helped out with getting around. We never felt like our questions were bothering them or they were too busy for us. They even helped us print our return flight tickets before leaving.We did not feel that the room was small at all, like we saw some others say. It was the same size as other hotel rooms we've been in. We loved the charm of the building, rather than being in a newly built hotel. We liked the accommodations in general. My only negative was our water pressure in the shower. It was practically nonexistent...I felt like Kramer on Seinfeld...took forever to do my hair afterwards.The location is AMAZING. Right in the middle of things and along the river. The L-train stop is nearby with several lines that meet there. It is right across from Trump Tower (take that as you may, I suppose). Like others have said, you can walk to so much. Overall, amazing experience. We will go back.
0	Don't Stay here!!. Checked in first and then saw the room: clean but small, depressing and on a hot weekend it was not air conditioned. The lodger in the room next door was drinking with the door open. Walls were thin. I took a look and asked to be refunded my fee on my credit card. The clerk ran my card and gave... More
0	Never Again. terrible terrible..... a guard was rude and nasty. Worst hotel stay of my life, and on my daughter's wedding.
0	Bed Bugs. Stayed here from Wednesday through Saturday February 27th till March 2nd. We had a roll away bed in the room and it had bed bugs, which means they can be anywhere in this hotel. Not getting much of an answer from the Hotel manager on this one, was supposed to call me but hasn't. Our toilet was broken and had to be plunged three times while we were there, we just gave up and used the toilet in the restaurant downstairs, which was hard to get to because the elevator was broken the entire time we were there. Not a great experience. The photo is actual if I wanted to fake one off the internet I would pick one that looked worse, actual bedbug bites from The Sheraton Four Points New Orleans on Bourbon St.We inspected every roll-away bed in our inventory and found no infestation of any kind. We also checked for substances that may cause skin irritation or allergic reactions. Again we found nothing. Our hotel is regularly serviced by a reputable extermination organization that provides reports of any pest findings. We answer all consumer concern calls but no one has attempted to contact me or my management staff on this matter.
0	A dated hostel with a few issues. We are now towards the end of our CA holiday. After staying in quite a few hostels now unfortunately this one wasn't the best of the bunch. But as you will read from the countless other reviews it serves a purpose. Its cheap (comparatively), central location, and has lots of communal space.We had a 4 person room without an ensuite. There was only 1 shower on each floor so plan your showering time accordingly. Despite the ageing building everything was kept clean by the staff.We had a constant water trickling noise in our room from pipes behind a wall. As with most hostels, ear plugs are essential. Also despite there being no visible heat source in the room, at night it was crazy hot.
1	Perfect location, wonderful stay. We just came back from a 5 day stay at the Columbus Motor Inn in San Francisco. First of all, let me thank all of the Trip Advisor Members who stated this was a great place--we took your advise and went for it.the location is perfect, right on Columbus -- you can walk to all the major spots: North Beach, Coit Tower, Chinatown, Fishermans W., great restraunts....., cable cars, the Muni line is literally at the doorstep. Plus Safeway and Trader Joes if you need something.The front desk can answer any question.The hotel is being remodeled and so everything is new.And Free Parking!!!! a major Plus! Just park the car and experience SF on foot---you will not be disappointed.The only drawback is that we like to stay at places that have some breakfast snacks. the Columbus did not. But they have coffee makers to get you started( bring your own coffee though, theirs is weak) and their prices are lower then most other places in the area---so it was ok.
0	Location is everything. The rooms are small but clean. We had a terrace by the pool, nice. No refrigerator in the room. They only leave 1 bottle of water per day.no heated pool. No fan in the bathroom for the humidity. Also parking is pricey. Location is excellent for the Bourbon Street experienceDear Kristen W,Although we are pleased to hear you enjoyed our prime, Bourbon Street location in addition to our clean guest rooms, we are sorry you were not fully satisfied with your stay. We take our guest comments very seriously, and will share your comments with our team to evaluate ways we can improve guest experience. Thank you for your review, and we hope the rest of your NOLA trip was a good one. Take care
1	We like it here. We always stay here using our Hilton Honors when we have a flight. It saves me from having to drive 1 1/2 hours to the airport in the morning. I like the little bar and the restaurant is very good. Everyone is always friendly. We usually don't get a chance to eat the breakfast because of an early fight.The rooms are comfortable and clean.I would have given it a 5 but had a little glitch this past time, May 12th. I needed a 4:00 am wake up call. I even went to the desk and doubled checked. They said all set.Good thing I take an alarm of my own because I never got a wake up call. I always take my own alarm clock because some of those clocks in the rooms are a pain to figure out.We will definitely stay here again when we have a flight.Dear BONNIE76,We are so glad that you came back for another visit. There is nothing more rewarding for our team to know that we made such a great impression on your earlier visits that you couldn't wait to come back. It is nice to know that our immaculate room, convenient location to the airport, excellent service and breakfast offerings were to your liking. However, Im sorry to hear that we missed your wake up call. I assure you this normally does not happen. I have used your feedback as a reminder for all of our team members of our procedure. Thank you again for your loyalty and we are looking forward to welcome you soon.Sincerely,Melissa PetiotAssistant General ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport
0	Wont stay here again and its a shame. I will never stay here again and its a shame because the facility and location were very nice. I booked and paid in full via Hotels.com. When I arrived and checked in their system messed something up and had a missing day in the middle of our 4 night stay. After waiting at the counter for over 20 minutes while the attendant the manager finally came over and gave us keys and assured it is fine the rate is the same and enjoy the stay. On the way to the room we were greeted by a lady attempting to sell the time shares. The lady was EXTREMELY rude, when we declined the information she made snippy comments like well don't you want to finish checking in. That was her sales tactic but standing there with room keys in my hand and not being born yesterday it was apparent she had nothing to do with us checking in. She also tried to bribe us with chocolate which was very juvenile. During check out and they told me I had a balance. I had to show them the paid in full email and remind them of what I was told when checking in. After going back and forth with the manager she is now going to call Hotels.com to resolve which she should have done in the beginning. The rooms were nice and location was fantastic but its a shame the desk staff doesn't have a clue, I will not be returning to this chain and also will push my friends and family to avoid it as well.
1	Great place to stay. Although we only used the hotel for a short period of time, we found the hotel was clean and affordable and close to beach. The staff was efficient and helpful and very quick to respond to our request. Breakfast room was clean, well-stocked and refilled quickly during the breakfast hours.Good Morning,Thank you for taking time to write a Tripadvisor review about your recent stay here at the Best Western Mission Bay. I am delighted to read your comments here at the Best Western Mission Bay we strive to deliver superior customer care, clean rooms and I'm glad we were able to provide that for you.Thank you again for being our guest. If you ever return to San Diego, youre welcome to contact me directly at 619-275-5700 ext 393 or Lpradohotelpros.biz for your reservation needs.Sincerely,Leidy PradoFront Office Manager
0	Hmm.... The rooms at this hotel sort of look like someone's attempt at an Edwardian themed hotel, only with some manky old 70s bedspreads and curtains. The staff are unfriendly and disengaged. The rooms are small and the free wifi is like dial up circa '96. You can barely open a website. Needs a damn good revamp because it clearly hasn't been decorated for 30 years. We had to ask at reception for a plug because the sink nor the bath had one. Location is fine - bus to downtown takes 10 minutes and costs 2.25 each. Plenty of shops and restaurants within walking distance.
1	Great Luxury Hotel at a reasonable price. Seattle has so many great hotels it was hard to choose. We only sayed one night prior to our Alaskan cruise, and it exceeded expectations. Beautiful, clean, marble bathroom with soaking tub, great toiletries. Comfy, clean bed, great service. Decent view of the city. PERFECT location. The whole experience was a pleasure and we will return.Thank you for the review and compliments for the Grand Hyatt Seattle! I truly hope you will be able to come back to Seattle and spend more time with us. We look forward to your next stay.Lindye W.Guest Relations Manager
0	There was an episode of COPS right outside our hotel room. I would rather sleep in a tent with scorpians, then stay here. Let's just call a spade a spade. There was an arrest outside of our hotel room at 1am. The place was filthy. Never stay here. However, the people running it were very helpful, kind people. I hope that they can invest in their property and make it better.
0	Dirty room, rude concierge. My husband and I were excited to stay at Estancia last week to celebrate my 30th birthday. Upon check-in, here are the things we noticed in our room that led us to believe it wasnt a luxury resort, as claimed:-Dirty diaper in our bathroom garbage-Dirty towels in a heap-Items in fridge from last guest-Opened water bottles (included in the outrageous 22/day resort fee)We were very nice about this and called the front desk just to mention it and ask for new water bottles although I think we should have made more of a fuss because a dirty diaper is pretty disgusting.What makes me the most upset about this resort is the service from the concierge. My parents ordered a cheese plate and bottle of wine to be delivered to our room upon our arrival because that was the day of my birthday. My mom was guaranteed that it would be delivered to our room within 30-45 minutes of our check-in, which would mean that the gift was delivered on my actual birthday. We did not receive the cheese plate or bottle of wine that day. On Saturday, just before noon, we received a cheese plate delivered to our room. I immediately contacted my parents to say thank you for the cheese plate, and my mom asked if there had been a bottle of wine with it, which I told her there had not. She contacted the hotel, got no answer, and left a message. I called in-room dining to inquire about the wine. They told me that they thought they would deliver the cheese plate in the morning and the wine after dinner. If someone orders wine and cheese as a gift, its because they want them to be enjoyed together, so this was obviously a lie.This entire time, my mom had been dealing with Gabby, who was rude, interrupted her, and didnt let her speak. When Gabby called back, my mom complained that the gift was not delivered on my birthday as promised, and was not delivered in its entirety. Gabby assured my mom that she would take some money off because of this, but my mom checked her banking and she had been charged an additional 35. When my mom called Gabby to talk about this, Gabby did apologize. However, she was still incredibly rude and told her that I had actually received the wine and cheese on Friday, but that I just didnt call my mom to thank her and that I lied when I said we didnt receive anything Friday. So not only was our room dirty upon check in, with a dirty diaper and more, but my mom tried to do something nice for us and the hotel has responded by being incredibly rude and accusing us of lying. The 35 has been taken off, but my parents are still paying full price for a gift that wasnt delivered on time, having to contact the hotel 6-7 times while my mom was on vacation, and being accused of lying.I left a voicemail for the manager two days ago and have not heard back. I will never stay at this luxury resort again.Thank you for taking the time to share your honest feedback with us on Trip Advisor. Your experience was certainly not indicative of our service standards, and it is simply saddening to read of your negative experience. We are though, happy that we are given this opportunity to personally apologize for the multiple mishaps you encountered during your stay. We know how important the little things are (especially on ones birthday) and I regret that we are unable to go back and fix the situation first hand. We appreciate your comments and will be researching the situation in more depth in order to prevent any experience such as yours from reoccurring. I sincerely hope we have the opportunity to welcome you back in the future and want to thank you again for your review.If you could please check your private messages we have sent you an email to further follow-up on your experience.
0	The worst. I needed a no frills place to sleep during the day and wifi internet while I was working in Denver overnight.I though a large chain would be a safe bet. I talked with the person working the desk and she let me check in early (12 noon instead of 3pm) and I thought I was off to a good start,... More
0	Bad experience. using AARP rate, room over looking I-4, noise all night, one themostat did not work, 10 pm it was worked on, but not much better, coffee maker did not work, upon checking out, my wife forgot a new pair of LL Beans slcaks on the bed, called a couple of hours later, no one knew anything, repeated calls yielded no responce. After repeated calls emails to Hilton and hotel nothing . They jusst dont care about theirt customers.We're very sorry to hear about the unpleasant experience you had while staying with us. It's our goal to provide great service and accommodations to all of our guests and we certainly dropped the ball. Please contact me at Tony.KeathleyHilton.com so that I can follow up personally and help alleviate some of your concerns. Kind regards, Tony Keathley General Manager
0	Good Location - Staff Need Updating!. Stayed here in the Spring of 2012. The location is great for walking around the Old Town area, and conveniently located to drive most places in San Diego. I think this place has a bit of arrogance in the way their run their business, though. When we arrived to move into our room with bay views, we got shoveled in a dirty, smelly room in the far upper corners of a building facing a park. I called the office and asked why we were paying for a bay view and got this room. We had to haul our luggage back down to the parkade and drive all the way back to the office to talk to them. They seemed quite upset that we were questioning the room we got they tried again with a room directly across from the stairwell facing a wall, but we refused that room as well. Their third try was this is the last room we have, which we took. It did face the bay, but was a corner room with the stairwell right in front of the door, which made it a little noisy when people's children were running up and down the stairs and breezeways. It was quite a big larger than the first room they tried to put us in, though. When I asked why we didn't get the room we had booked months in advance, the response was we're full. Huh Stay was OK because we didn't have to engage with the staff again until we checked out. Lots of steps and climbs up and down the road if you're in the upper buildings. Restaurant staff on the arrogant side as well. Must be catchy at this hotel! Parking is horrible - don't bring anything bigger than a Ford Fiesta! Wouldn't stay here again. Sadly, they have a great location, but really indifferent, slightly arrogant, almost rude staff. I'd head for Coronado next time!
1	Average to Good hotel. The rooms were good and clean, and so were the bathroom. I wished if they had any refrigerator in the room. Staff was very helpful. The breakfast options were disappointing. No omelettes and they charged 1 for every addition to scrabbled eggs. I had to pay 3 extra to get onions, peppers and tomatoes added to my scrabbled eggs. Except this, the experience was great. I loved the fireplace opposite the reception.Thank you for your kind comments about our great rooms and hotel staff. I am sorry about your experience in the restaurant options. We hope it wont keep you from coming back the next time you are in Seattle!
1	Great stay!. I had a suite and was able to work in a quiet room and still enjoy the amazing property. Witness a wedding in a great location and parking is easy. Valet were very friendly and all front desk staff were VERY accommodating! They offer champers and whiskey at check in!Dear Keisha F.Thank you for taking the time to share your comments about your weekend stay with us at Estancia. We are glad that you were able to get your work done in a peaceful environment, but also enjoy a wedding on the grounds. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon!
1	Perfect New Orleans location, staff and value. This hotel was a great value and location for my wife and I in New Orleans. Located right off the trolley lines and midway between Tulane U. and downtown. The staff was extremely helpful with recommendations and our needs, especially Mollie and Janae. This location is also a quick walk to Magazine St. for great dining and bars. I'd recommend Rum House to anyone for dinner. The hotel was quiet, clean, offered an OK breakfast, had a workout room (but running on the trolley greenway is perfect) and business room. One of the best hotel values I've stayed at in a while.
1	Chic design transports you to tranqulity. The Broome doesnt feel like NYC at allIt captures the elegance of Morocco and you feel a world away from the traffic and bustle of the city. The rooms are small, which is standard in NYC, but I did expect a bit more space for the price. The beds are comfy with super luxury sheets. This might be an odd point, but many of the luxury hotels I have been in lately have moved away from using a fitted sheet on the bed, which leaves the guest with a flat sheet on the bottom that twists and bunches by the morning. I was delighted that The Broome still uses both flat and fitted sheetsit is a must for a good nights sleep! The staff is enthusiastic and welcoming. A good stay, indeed!Dear ECWPhD:On behalf of the team, thank you again for staying with us and thank you for sharing your feedback with us. It was a delight welcoming you into our little Oasis. In fact our rooms are designed in and out to offer a little break from the city while you are in the city. We wish to have you back again very soon. Until then, if you need anything at all, please do not hesitate to contact us at infothebroomenyc.com.
0	Does the job, but needs work and TLC.. The Allstate Inn located in historic Seymour Indiana (Home to John Couger Mellancamp) is a two star establishment independently owned and operated, right off of I-65 and right next to a Waffle House. It is also not located far from Wal-Mart and a couple of other decent restaurants and gas stations in the area. My stay, was in their Honeymoon... More
0	Do not stay here.. Very upset with my stay at this hotel. Room is nice but staff is extremely rude and incompetent. Female manager made us vacate the hotel room at 1AM in the morning because of an error that her staff made. Showed no empathy or concern for her guests, was rude and threatened us. She also refused to give me her name. I don't recommend the hotel just because of the staff. Didn't even receive my deposit back. Overall, horrible experience.
1	A great, fantastic experience!. This is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in! Check-in was a breeze and had no problems getting to our room. The lobby displayed a classic 1920s hotel style, as well as a grand staircase. The hotel's elevators are room key activated only, for safety reasons. We had a smoking corner room on the ninth floor and there was no trace of smoke anywhere in the room. There was clean white sheets on the bed and clean carpets. Also to our surprise, there was a door that led out to a balcony (we was one of the two rooms to have this.), which I enjoyed being a outdoors person. The bathroom was clean and spotless. The shower provided shampoo, conditioner, and body wash, although I brought my own. The 5:30 Kickback in the lobby was like dinner to us. There was hot dogs, chicken tenders, cocktails, and liquor (2 for every person and show your room key). The pool and hot tub were clean and pristine, although I didn't use it. The views from the rooftop were breathtaking. The fitness room had a bike and step machines and two treadmills (a somewhat small room, though). The general manager and his staff were great to us. I will recommend this Drury Hotel and will stay here again when I come back to NOLA.
0	Meh. The shower had issues maintaining one temperature which was very disheartening. The first room I checked in to reeked of cigarettes, but they gladly moved me once I complained. Overall a little underwhelmed with the hotel this time around...
0	Rude 1st shift staff. Initially a was quite satisfied with this hotel until checkout time, I proceeded to the room containing the continental breakfast which was miniscule to say the least. I decided against the breakfast and grabbed my cooler. We needed ice for the the rest of the trip. A staff member yelled at me for doing this and said I was not... More
1	Great location and Up-to-date upgrades. The Mercantile Hotel was great. I stayed there for one night with a group of five friends including me to celebrate my friends birthday. We stayed in two bedroom suite. The suite was updated with modern design had two TVs a living room with mini fridge, microwave, and keuring. We stayed on the 3rd floor no real view there was parking garage on the other side. The only thing it needs is a pool. The hotel does have a gym and offer free wife. The record player was also a big hit with my friends. I did my reservation through Groupon. Thank you so much for taking the time to review your stay with us, Sandraev1. We are so happy to hear that you enjoyed a 5-star stay with us. We hope to welcome you back soon! -Ryann
1	Nice hotel, great location. I've stayed at this hotel twice. Each time was only for one night, however, so I can't comment much on housekeeping other than to say my room was always clean and presentable upon each check in. This last time I did have an issue with the outlets on the desk next to the televison, so I had to make my tea by my nightstand with the provided coffee maker. It would also be a great convenience if they had a mini fridge and microwave in each room. But other than those minor issues, I can't complain and would return. The cookies are delicious as well.
0	Not for Business Traveler. No desk or desk chair. No Internet except for rooms close to office. Air conditioner very loud. Uncomfortable bed.
0	There's a reason for the previous bad reviews!!!!. It looks decent from the outside but the rooms are dingy and dirty. We were on the second floor and heard EVERY step the people took above us! We also woke up to water under the sink seeping onto the bathroom floor! We gave it a try but we are moving on to another hotel today!

0	If I could give less than one star I would.. Horrible. Never stay here. I would not have stayed if it wasn't non-refundable. Burn holes in the blankets, stains and tears all over the chair that was in the room to sit in, and I even slept in my clothes on top of the covers. Seriously disgusting. Never again.
0	Stained bed covers mattresses. Only good thing is close location to downtown. Manager wrote me back defending that the mattresses will be replaced over the next couple of years but no mention of why they use blood stained bed covers. Otherwise I certainly won't be coming back ...
1	Excellent hotel. Stayed here on business. Guest services and all attendants were very helpful and pleasant. Location is most convenient. Marta station is across the street. Lenox mall is next door with a covered walkway to it, wife LOVED that. Houston's restaurant across Lenox Rd was superb(see separate review). Room was quite nice and the bedding was fabulous. The negative was the AC was on 67, woke up hot, turned it down to 63, woke up in the am still hot and it wasn't one of those blistering days that you can experience in ATL. Otherwise the hotel was very good and modestly priced for ATL considering the quality.PS: The parking lot requires the room key to use to exit and there is a box to drop it in, if you have checked out. A strange set up and I wasn't informed about this when I checked out. Had to buzz the desk and get them to open the gate, which held up 4cars behind me wanting to leave.Thank you for your excellent comments and feedback. I am sorry that you were too warm in your guest room and had some challenges with your garage departure. Rest assured we will have our engineering staff check the guest room thermostats and review our departure process in the garage. Thank you for letting us know. I do hope that you will consider visiting again to enjoy our services and conveniences.
0	The staff at the hotel are excellent especially Marco help carry at less 50 or more bags to the second and third due to. The hotel was a nightmare . I killed big roaches, bathroom was falling apart. First floor I saw baby roaches all over the microwave . Elevator was broke so we had to walk up to second and third for two days and was broke when we left. Food that ordered or sitting in the lounge stayed there to the next... More
1	Bday party stay. stayed for a birthday party on the 26th DEC. SAL at the front desk was amazing!!!!! he is so sweet and his service was completely very welcoming. Anything we needed or had questions about SAL was the guy to go to. he knew all the area asked what we liked and made sure our car was there without waiting. All others at the front desk were not as professional and were not courteous. there was a big difference in service. SAL made it feel like we were in Vegas very professional. I will be coming back again ONLY if SAL is there. ME and my Husband luv the place. Thank you SAL!!!!
1	Great Location, Excellent Hospitality!. Stayed here for a week and had a fantastic experience. After reading other great reviews, decided that combined with price, this sounded like a great place to stay. Was not disappointed. Location was great -- less than 1 block to Waikiki Beach. Only 1 block other direction to bus stops, Kuhio Ave. Was able to walk from hotel to any Waikiki attraction in very short distance. I was glad I upgraded to the ocean view room because the view was great. Leonor was a wonderful host, providing us with bamboo mats, rafts, and beach towels free of charge, and boxes of candy on departure. This hotel will very shortly have a new name, though, as it is being remodeled. The rooms now are old, but clean. The new rooms that Leonor showed us are unbelievable with modern amenities. The first of the new rooms are set to open in a few wks. Can't imagine what this will do to the price but with the location and helpful staff, it just might be worth it.Would recommend staying here to anyone looking for a hotel low on price and great on hospitality!
0	THIS PLACE WAS TERRIBLE!!!. I had a HORRIBLE experience at the this hotel last summer. So bad I ended up checking out at 6am (as soon as the 1st Greyhound was leaving) and I still haven't heard anything from them about my stay, the money I wasted on this disgusting and dirty experience. I HAD TO SLEEP IN MY CLOTHES because I didn't want to touch anything. And has anyone noticed the hotel is only responding to good reviews HEY HOTEL MANAGEMENT!!!!! What do you have to say about my horrible stay How are you going to make it right
1	Clean, convenient. The location was perfect -- easy to find and suited our needs for our activities while in town. Check-in was easy, people were nice, the room was clean. It's not fancy, but given the alternatives in Napa (very pricey), it suited our needs. (We had two rooms, and our relatives had a third.) There's no getting around that this is a Best Western, with Denny's as the anchor restaurant. Clean, no frills, convenient. No more, no less.Annhurst - I am pleased to hear that our hotel suited all your needs. We are thrilled you got everything you needed in your visit to Napa. Come visit us again soon.
1	Pleasant Surprise. This hotel has a lot to offer at a good value. The suite was spacious for the price. It offered a separate BR from the tv watching area and desk. It had two televisions, a fridge and microwave. The staff were courteous and friendly to a fault. This Embassy Suite was very close to the Monuments, literally an exit away. There were restaurants close, as well. As to the extras - the hotel offered on site parking in their private garage. There was a great complimentary breakfast each morning, offering every conceivable food. Last, there was a 3 hour happy hour that offered free drinks (adult beverages as well!) and snacks - daily! This Embassy Suite was very close to the Monuments, literally an exit away. There were restaurants close, as well. We would, absolutely, stay here again!
1	Super pleased. We had sat down to plan a trip to San Diego... We had planned 5 days in San Diego.. We looked at hotels and motels by the beach. We quickly decided staying on the beach was super super pricey. This Best western worked out great. Although it is not on the beach, it is an easy 6 min drive from the beach. 6 min drive to old town San Diego as well. The breakfast had a great variety! I am gluten free and generally have limited options. This breakfast offered eggs, bacon, fruit and yogurt. They also offered a variety of other items as well waffles and breakfast burritos and breakfast sandwiches. It can be a bit of a noisy place( to no fault to the hotel) Kids can be a bit rowdy lol The pool was so fantastic! We enjoyed it almost everyday. The room was clean and spacious as well. Parking was super convenient WE would definitely stay here again..Good Morning,Thank you so much for your compliments to our hotel. It is wonderful to know you were happy with your stay and location. Our hotel is very centralized which is just within minutes to most location like beaches, park, Sea World and many more other attractions.When you return to San Diego, please feel free to contact me directly for all of your reservation needs. You can reach me at 619-275-5700 x 393 or Lpradohotelpros.bizSincerely,Leidy PradoFront Office Manager
0	Ruined my birthday mood and I am disgusted by it ALL. I have stayed at this Drury Inn every other year when I visit New Orleans during Mardi Gras Season. This year was no different... To make a long story short- Drury Inn charged me for two rooms but failed to let me know that upon arrival or checking in the hotel (I had apreviously called the hotel to cancel the reservation FYI). After I noticed the charge on my account I called and spoke with the manager Patrick to reverse the charges. He was super rude, loud talking over me, and had an I dont care attitude. He stated that he would fax in the necessary paperwork to my bank as they requested via email.( that was a Sunday) Monday went and still no funds-Tuesday came and still no funds. At this point my automatic withdrawals started to come out of the account. Which enabled my account to go in the negative and it set a domino effect. I checked in on Saturday and my bank froze my account due to suspicious fraud so I wasnt able to get any money off my account (but it didnt matter because Drury Inn had it all wrap up). Tuesday before I left I spoke with my bank and they told me they never received the proper paperwork so I went to the front desk and spoke with Jaime and she faxed the proper info over for me. Not even 30 minutes later my bank called me and said they received the paperwork and the funds are credited to my account. Now on to the housekeeping- our room had not been cleaned the entire time we were there- which was a Saturday through a Tuesday. Yes the trash was emptied and the beds covers had been pulled over( which I had an issue with because the first day the sheets I had had urine stains on them) after I returned back to the room I asked if someone could come change my sheets. When I returned I asked the front desk if it was taken care of and they stated yes (what they didnt know is that I put a quarter in the middle of the bed under the covers). When I came to the room it was still there. The entire I was there no one vacuum the floor and I had to call everyday to ask for towels - the minimum required towels was not left in my room after cleaning it. I had a few questions and concerns for the manager Patrickbut he blew me off, loud talking me, his exact words were you did this so deal with it. Tuesday morning I attempt email to contact the manager Slade about the situation just to let him know that my bank stated they never received the authorization to reverse funds but he never called me back and I called him at 8:22 am. Yes I went down to the front desk and Jaime took care of it but he was avoiding me because he did not want to handle the situation. His exact words were you would have to call Patrick because he knows the situation and I dont have anything to do with it since he already knows the story. The crazy thing is I actually love this hotel but I wont ever be staying here again when I come to New Orleans. Talk about unprofessional and unable to handle a situation! By the way if I could give a negative 22 on the score I would. All weekend I was suppose to be enjoying the festivities for my birthday but I had to continuously run up behind Drury Inn for answers. What if I didnt have any cash on me how was I going to be able to get back home Im so disgusted by it ALL.
1	Not Downtown Near the Needle. This hotel is a great place for business or vacation. The staff is friendly, the rooms are your typical Four Points rooms - standard for the Four Points brand. The suites are really nice, but not worth the extra money as the standard rooms include a small sitting area and a large desk that spans the long wall. The Wednesday night grill they include with the local brews deal is more than enough to make a dinner out of as well. Underground parking is really nice during the cold and rainy months. Within walking distance to the needle, but not near Pike's Market at all, would have to drive to get to that and parking downtown near that area is pretty expensive.Thank you for sharing your thoughts on our hotel. We are thrilled to hear you enjoyed your stay at our hotel and that you found our staff to be friendly. Its also great you were able to take advantage of our Wednesday night Best Brews BBQ evening reception. Our convenient location is not only walking distance to the Space Needle, but there is alternate transportation available to and from Pikes Market and the downtown business district, such as Monorail. Plus, our front desk is always happy to help arrange local transportation. These alternative transportation options may be less expensive than parking downtown depending, of course, on how long one plans to stay. Thanks again and we hope to see you soon. Take care.
0	Service highly variable. Fridge kills food. Cramped workspace.. For me, a hotel is all about the bed and workspace. Here, the bed was ok the workspace was cramped (chair bumps up against the bed not much room to move back). The Fridge Checked in after stopping at the grocery store and put 52 worth of food in the fridge. Tried to find a dial to check the setting... More
1	Nice place on Madison street. This place was somewhat too expensive for me, but I chose it because close distance to the Convention Center was critical for me, and closer hotels were even more expensive. The place is just 10 minutes walk from the Convention Center. The road from the enter to the hotel is uphill. My room was clean and spacious, with a closet. The windows faced downhill with a broad view. The only problem was a fan below the windows. I heard its noise when I opened the window. Nevertheless, my overall rating is very good.Dear mikhail534, Thank you for reviewing your recent stay at Hotel Sorrento.I am so pleased to know that you enjoyed the hotel's location and the guestroom appointments, I am, however, disappointed to learn of fan noise, when you opened the window. Please know that I very much appreciate your feedback, as it is only in this way that we can improve upon our shortcomings. We hope you will return again so we can ensure your stay is flawless from beginning to end. Best regards, Shannon Sheron, Managing Director
0	Just your basic motel. If you're looking for a clean bed and micro and refrigerator, this is the place for you. It doesn't have much going for it as far as location or decor. In fact, if you want coffee, they send you across the street to the Circle K! The price was reasonable for what we got and it was pet friendly. It... More
1	Quaint and Comfortable. While an older hotel, it has some charm to it. The rooms are large and comfortable. The beds give a good nights sleep. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. The coffee shop is decently priced and has a nice outdoor patio. The negatives aren't too bad. One elevator, not a long wait. Could use a coat of paint and a little polish here and there. Maybe a little updating would help. On the brighter side, no pun intended, I always look for the brightness of the room and the available sockets to plug in our electronics. The rooms have more than adequate light and the lamps/light fixtures each have outlets for plugins. They are part of Virginia Mason hospital and Medical Center. This was very convenient for us and close to downtown. FREE WI-FI!Hi Traveler - Thank you for your comments. Yes we are the historic, quaint and comfortable hotel choice for you in Seattle. We hope to welcome you again on your next visit to Seattle. Safe travels!
1	Loved Staying Here and miss it already!. My Husband and I are thrilled that we chose Best Western St. Charles as our hotel for the week. We were greeted by very nice people, and I was overjoyed to see a lighted make-up mirror in the room since I was in town for a Wedding. The room was beautiful and the neighborhood was wonderful. With the trolley right outside we were able to jump into the French Quarter or go the opposite way to enjoy a stroll in the park very easily. The breakfast was delicious and during the day you can also munch on cheese and grapes. The staff was terrific, and extremely nice to everyone. I cannot say enough good things about this sweet hotel... but to say I will definitely stay here again when I return to Louisiana.Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel Val! I'm glad to read you enjoyed our location, breakfast, and staff! We look forward to seeing you the next time you are in town!Kathleen DavisFront Office Manager
0	Disgusting. leaky toilet, remote didn't work, promised high speed Internet not at all available. Manager blamed Cox after desk clerk had me speak with someyahoo techie in New Jersey who I couldn't even understand. Smelly rooms.Construction all over. Noisy air conditioner that wouldn't cycle properly. Butthe good news Could see fireworks from nearby Seaworld.
0	Bad Experience. Overall bad, bad registration process, had to make the reservation twice and in both cases no email confirmation. Almost had me booked for two rooms and would have had I not made several calls to confirm reservation. Also on the morning of check out there...MoreMany people think that a slightly poor review is a problem for a hotel...this is not true. By letting us know what went wrong during your stay, we learn what we need to work on. Thank you for letting us know and we hope that...More
1	Comfortable, quiet, clean. We enjoyed out stay here. It was a busy weekend, but quiet here. Typical Best Western full breakfast. They had a bar pool, but too cold for the pool. Well kept and clean. Rooms are comfortable. It was a long walk to Burbon Street, so we took cabs most of the time.We are happy that you enjoyed your stay here at our hotel.. Our staff loves to get positive feedback from our guests. We take great pride in providing great customer service to all of our guests. We consider our guests as family and look forward to seeing you again real soon.Robert K., Manager on Duty
1	Good stay. My family and I (2 kids 2 adults) stayed at Quality Suites San Diego Sea World Area in early Oct 2018. We stayed in a king size room with a pull out sofa bed. The king bed was very comfy but the pull out sofa wasnt comfy for the kids and wouldnt be able to accommodate an adult. You would be better to get another bedding configuration. The pull out sofa bed was in an offset room/sitting area (with a separate tv) that can be closed with a glass sliding door. The full room is compact so if you have very big bags, they wouldnt be able to be left open all the time as you probably couldnt walk past them. The kids loved the pool, and we could here a little bit of noise from where we were but not much (we were on the 3rd floor in the far corner so it was the quietest area). The breakfast and breakfast area was good. The staff were friendly and the location was central to the zoo and the airport. We used Lyft to go places. You could go across the highway to the mission valley shopping area but we didnt do that. There is a Dennys, petrol station, benihana, Wendys and another food place within several minutes walk (and a Wendys further) on the hotel side of the highway. Overall we had a good stay as it provided everything we needed for our couple of nights.Dear Guest - We appreciate you taking the time to provide us with such candid feedback of your stay. I am very sorry to hear that your stay did not meet expectations. At the same time glad to know that kids loved the pool and you liked the breakfast! I'm sure our entire hotel staff enjoyed catering to your needs as well. Looking forward to welcoming you back soon!
0	Don't stay here.. They charge if a person smokes yet they do not clean the room if they do. I was put in a non smoking room that reeked of smoke. The a/c did not work, the internet did not work, the ice machine did not work. I have a service dog and was put in the room furthest from the potty area... More
0	Very dirty. We were underwhelmed with the room. It was cleaned very fast without any attention to detail, hairs on the bed, dirty glass doors, sticky floors and tables, etc...I really don't know how this mess was awarded a 3 star rating! Even the shower curtains were falling apart, renovations looked like they were done by a 10 year old. Sorry but not up to my standards (which are not unreasonable).
0	Got What I Paid For.... I stayed at this hotel a month ago, and I got it on Hotels.com with a coupon. When I arrived, the night clerk was not too friendly, but was fast in completing the check-in process. The room was on the ground level, and had some noisy people walking past it throughout the night. On the good side, the bed and pillows were clean and comfortable, and the were plenty of lightning options in the room. I got a good night's rest. It also had a flat-screen TV, but I didn't watch it, so I can't comment on whether it worked or not. On the bad side, the shower did not have any hot water, and the sink faucet did not produce any water at all. So I had to take a cold shower and had to wash my hands, brush my teeth, etc. by turning on the water faucet in the bathtub and washing in my hands and moistening my toothbrush in the resulting flow of water. There were also none of the freebies you expect at a hotel, like toothpaste. Another downfall was that hard to step in and out of because the outer wall was high. I almost slipped when I got out of the shower.The morning clerk was friendly and completed the check-out process quickly. Overall, I would only stay here for a night at most. And ask for a room with running water in the sink and hot water in the shower.
1	Friendly, convenient hotel.. This hotel was a great pic. The staff is very friendly, helpful, and seem to love their jobs. Even the maids had big smiles on their faces. The hotel itself is elegant and cozy, with a great bar and restaurant, nice outdoor courtyard, great pool and outdoor patio area, and small but nice rooms. Comfortable beds. The bathrooms could use more counter space and towel racks, but are clean and updated. Hotel location is great and is within walking distance to everything. The valet parking is expensive (~$29 a day) which is a pet peeve of mine - I think the parking should always be included. However the valet staff is also very friendly and helpful. I highly recommend this hotel.
0	Meh!. The room was what you pay for. It reeked of smoke and the Internet was weak and intermittent. The staff was friendly and they have a continental breakfast. Close to the Opry Mills Mall and lots of food options.
0	Your room will never be cleaned. The hotel is well located for tourist attractions and check-in was easy. Getting maid service of any kind was next to impossible. No one would take responsibility of any kind. I called corporate and they agreed and called the hotel. Finally a general manager spoke with me and guaranteed my room would be cleaned between 9 am and 2 pm the next day when I was to attend a wedding. It didn't happen. Bathroom trash really does need to be disposed of daily. Both elevators broke during our stay and we never saw a repair person. So 6 flights of stairs every time. What was to have been a joyous occasion turned in to a very bad experience.Dear TravelingJeffry,Thank you very much for taking the time to review your stay with us here at the Hyatt house Seattle. I am sorry that your stay did not go as planned and that your room was not serviced and the elevators were down for maintenance. I can see how this would be create a very bad experience or you while you were in town for a wedding. Also that I did not get to speak with you in person while you were staying with us. If you choose to stay with us again and I hope you do give us another opportunity then please reach out to me directly and I will ensure your stay is wonderful. Again I am sorry if we let you down this is the opposite of our purpose. Sincerely,Jonathan
1	Cool place, great staff!. My boyfriend and I stayed here based on the reviews on this site, which I can usually depend on--and again, they were right!The hotel is very nice inside, the location is prime, and the staff is one of the Best we have ever encountered, and I have travelled worldwide. The rooms are smaller, but if you think about it, what is missing is the vast expanse between the side of the bed and the main window, and who uses that Anyway!Great things that made up for the smaller size (and my boyfriend is 6'2 and had No problem with the hotel at all!)are the small kitchenette, with coffee maker and supplies for morning java, the bathroom and it's nice shower, and the bed was very comfortable! Ask for a room higher up and enjoy the great view! We were not disturbed by any noises, nor elevator troubles, in the least. There is also a nice desk in the room, for your laptop. Once more, the staff here will do everything in their power to make your stay wonderful!We Will be going back ,and we will be staying at CQ! There is also a small cafe in front of the hotel that had a very good breakfast, and looked busy at night with casual cocktails and Italian food that looked great.Remember that you are not moving in for good, and once you get in the room, you will find you have all the space you need!
0	Okay but not going to be a repeat. This was def not the worst place I have ever stayed but there was a inch or more gap under the door, pet rooms are on the back side of the hotel next to what could possibly be Tenn, grodiest swimming pool. Highway noise was extremely high and the pool had a malfunction which had it making tons of racket... More
0	These people try, but they miss the mark.. The place is dirty. My daughter and son in law stayed there about a month ago. The place was worn down and in need of a good cleaning. The TVs were old and worn out as well. Most people never stay here twice.
0	A wedding hotel - avoid. I have had to stay here quite a few times over the past few years. Staff nice, room clean, nice beds,etc,etc. BUT. Terrible acoustics mean you hear everything. And as they have wedding parties every weekend you have to suffer noise and disruption from wedding guests staying in the hotel. Up until 5am at times. No sleep for me. Smoking and drinking outside the front lobby, and no one to stop them until I phoned at 2am to complain. Where is the noise coming from , I was asked Right in front of you , I said. They need to MANAGE this. Not put non wedding guests on floors with guests, and they should put polite notices up about noise. During the week fine - but avoid the weekend unless you like being kept up all night.
1	Hotel disguised as resort. Booked a night here for a Staycation with my husband. While we got a good rate for room, I expected a lot more from a resort hotel. Standard room didn't differ much from a chain hotel room. The grounds are gorgeous, yes, but they have to be when surrounded by other properties (no ocean views, etc.) There were two weddings going on at the time, so very busy, and staff seemed focused on wedding parties. The bars restaurants on site on very good, pool is saline which was refreshing and jacuzzi needs to be bigger! Bartender in the Bodega bar had great customer service.
0	Will not stay again.. I stayed Monday through Friday on a business trip. When I checked in, I did a quick scan of the room, there was no refrigerator or microwave. I pulled the comforter back and noticed about 7 (what appeared to be) burn holes in the sheet, right by the pillow. I was moved to another room that had a small refrigerator and microwave. The room was dirty, cobwebs in the corner by the old A/C unit. The A/C was very loud and woke me up throughout the night when it would kick in. The chair in front of the unit was stained and not all the lights/fixtures were operational. The fitness area was a mess and the equipment was broken, cups on the floor, empty water container, and towels on the floor. Typical continental breakfast, sometimes there was coffee in the morning, but not every morning.
1	Great value for the dollar. Wasn't expecting much from this hotel due to the low rate, however the staff was very organized. I called earlier in the day to let them know I would not be arriving until 11pm. The front desk staff had my key and paperwork sitting out when I arrived. I was in the room in a few minutes.The room itself, had a real king size comfortable bed in it. The room was decorated well. The bathroom was neat, a shower with just a glass wall.The restaurant and bar were very nice, although I only went to the free continental breakfast.The hotel looks like it was updated within 10 years, but then has had alot of use.Only room issues were the shower and bathroom drywall had taking a beating with the lack of a shower curtain, it should be fixed. Looks like the maintenance staff just threw some spackle and painted over the water damage.My room faced the highway, so it was rather loud all night, however the AC was loud enough to drown out the noise. If you stay more than one night I would suggest getting a room facing the other way. The TV only has basic channels, no HBO or Showtime.
1	Great Find. Pleasantly surprised at the quality of this hotel. Our room had a sleeping room and a siting room with two TVs, which was a nice bonus. The hotel was conveniently located in Old Town as well as having a restaurant on site. Breakfast was great as was view of city. Its always wonderful to hear weve exceeded expectations! Thank you for taking the time to share your impressions. Sounds like your suite was perfect! We are also pleased our location right in the heart of Old Town, met your visiting needs. We hope you will visit us again soon and Happy New Year! Regards,Ryan AguinaldoGeneral Manager

The policy was backdated to a month before I booked the room. They don't even give you the opportunity to cancel less than 30 minutes after booking...beware!Hello Greg R, I'm sorry to hear that you had an issue with cancelling your reservation through hotels.com.

1	Great location. This was conveniently located near all the sights. The rooms were clean comfortable. Like many hotels of this era it could use some updating for more outlets for electronics. An outlet at the nightstands would be helpful for using your laptop on the bed. This could be easily remedied with a light fixture w/ an outlet in itDear arlynnh543,Thank you for taking the time to write a review for our Property Best Western Cabrillo Garden Inn. We value your comments and suggestions for us to know where we fall short and it gives us the opportunity to improve and provide an excellent service.Again, thank you and hope to see you on your next visit to San Diego.Best!YChen
0	Disgusting. The towels were stained. The comforter had burn holes in it. The tub grips were starting to turn black. And there were bugs in the bed. My sister and I ended up sleeping on top of the covers because it was a holiday weekend and nowhere else had vacancies.
1	Two nights in Orlando. We have been to Disney before and wanted to visit Sea World. The Best Western is a hotel for families on a budget. It is on westwood drive, within walking distance (10 mins) to Sea World. Breakfast and parking was included in the hotel rate, which for the area is a bonus. Breakfast was decent, and the room good for a good nights sleep. Staff was friendly and allowed us to check in before 3 pm. They are usually full, so recommend a reservation in advance. They offer a shuttle to sea world but my kids and I just took a short walk back and forth and were able to go back to sea world for their night shows.
1	Academic Visit to New Orleans at Tulane University. We had a wonderful trip at New Orleans as we are invited by Tulane University School of Medicine. Me and my spouse were extremely busy with academic commitments. The hotel is very good and near to Tulane School of Medicine. Breakfast is good and service is very high quality. The room is descent, medium size with all the amenities. Bathroom is simply superb. Room service is also praiseworthy. Only draw back is its House Keeping team. One should not keep any valuables or important materials outside as during house keeping things may be missing. One should lock all the valuables in his or her suitcase before leaving the room and kept for house keeping. This issue was serious by nature and we have reported several times on this issue. Otherwise it is a lovely hotel with very friendly front office staffers.Thank you for sharing the details of your stay. We are glad you enjoyed your stay and we appreciate the comments. We do provide a safe in the room for valuabls, in this case I'm aware of the medications that were inadvertently thrown away, I'm glad we were able to retrieve them for you. We look forward to seeing you again soon.Thank youWayneGeneral Manager

0	Stayed at economy motels better than this one.. The grout in the bathroom was filthy,  the rooms are out dated.  The noise we got being on the 39th floor must have been from poor insulated glass.  We could hear the cars driving.  The bed wall was aginst the two elevators running up and down all night.  The breeze way running to the vehicle garage was being used as the smoking area buy the staff.  It was suffocating coming in and out of the building.  The only time we ate there was first day in the morning.   The buffet was horrible.  The bacon was rock hard,  the powdered eggs tasted like caulk, the ham was nothing but grease.  Very unhappy with the meal.  And to top it off it cost $35.00 for two of us.  I had continental breakfast that had more to offer, and alot better taste. Adding the 34.00 for car parking,  the horrible breakfast,  and two nights of restless sleep.   It cost me 700.00.  This is a very unsatisfied customer that will post to other trends to let people know that this is hotel shouldn't even have a rating.
0	Not good.. Not pleasant at all. Loud noises and voices after midnight. Parking lot and stairs in a very bad condition. People who checked me in and out seem to be too busy and in a bad mood.
0	Very Disappointed. I asked for non-smoking room but doubt very much that the room assigned was non-smoking. It literally stinks. The surrounding of the property was poorly maintained, hardly swept. The outdoor pool area was even worst. It looks like it hasn't been cleaned for weeks. The garbage cans were overflowing from the day I get there. The following evening, it was still the same way. This should be rated as .5 star.
0	The service is not good. The sink is broken. Nobody came to fix, even though I called front desk 2 times.
0	A Terrible Mistake!. My partner booked us a twin bed room thinking it was the San Francisco Hostel International. What a mistake! We were given an incredibly squeaky (aka you can't roll over without waking up the whole floor including yourself) single bunk bed with stained mattresses. There was also some kind of unidentified matter smeared across the wall which could have easily been cleaned if they could be bothered. The bathrooms, halls etc we're all equally filthy.We asked to be changed into a twin bed room (as we had booked) or a double and we're constantly fobbed off by each staff member. Each would tell us to come back and speak to them again in x hours (when their shift had finished). When we went back they would be gone and it would start again. This also included the manager. I understand this place is closing in a few months (my guess is due to being shut down by health and safety) and as a result the staff do not care in the least. If you have another option then take it. And before you think this person sounds like a prude or is being precious I have stayed in probably 100 hostels allover the world and this is by far the worst. It also really affected our holiday in San Fran as there was no chance of sleep in the squeaky bunk bed. I note there are some decent reviews however most of them seem to be for the other hostel we tried to book (there ain't no waffles here!).You've been warned!!!
0	Outdated Hotel. although the staff were very accomodating, the hotel itself was old, needed renovation. lobby was gorgeous but the rooms inconsistent. hot water takes 10 - 15 minutes to come to the tap.
1	Good value. Everything in site.. Everything needed on site. Laundry, restaurant, bar, room service, sundry. Excellent location, near airport and multiple restaurants and businesses. Clean rooms and lounge area. Friendly staff. Will stay again.Thank you for your kind review of the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport. Its our goal to deliver a great value at a fair price, and we like reading that we have accomplished just that. We believe that our convenient location, fresh rooms, excellent customer service, and many complimentary features, makes us an excellent choice in the area. We appreciate your business and look forward to your return!Sincerely,Michael GoldwasserGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport
1	W SEATTLE PERFECT PLACE TO STAY. This was our first time in Seattle. The first part of our stay was at another hotel but we had to change to the W due to availability. I wish we had just stayed the entire trip at the W. The staff was excellent and the room was amazing. We had a huge room on the 25th floor with a view of the sound as well as the Space Needle. This was the first time we actually spent a great deal of time in the room since the view was spectacular. I would absolutely stay there again should we return to Seattle. IN ALL CAPS TOO, I LOVE IT! We are thrilled that you ended up with us and LOVED it! We wish you would have been at W the whole time as well! The views from the room are AMAZING, we agree! Please let us welcome you back anytime! Thanks again!
0	Awkward setup. This place was loud and had the most awkward set up. It made it very difficult to rest. Disney on 4 hours of sleep kinda sucks. The place was pretty clean.
1	Nice hotel, good location. The hotel was nothing fancy, but we don't stay in our room when we go on vacation. It was conveniently located to many tourist attractions- Old Town, Balboa Park, downtown, etc. The rooms were clean and comfortable, staff was friendly, and the price was decent. Overall, I would stay here again.Good Afternoon,I appreciate you taking time to review our hotel regarding your recent stay here at the Best Western Mission Bay. I'm happy to know you were happy with your stay and location. Thank you so much for your compliments to our staff. We work hard to deliver superior customer care with clean rooms and I'm glad we were able to provide that for youWhen you return to San Diego area, please feel free to contact me directly for your reservation needs. You can reach me at 619-275-5700 ext 393 or Lpradohotelpros.bizThank you again for your review,Leidy PradoFront Office Manager
1	High End SF Hotel. First let me start by saying that this is not a cheap hotel, however the same can be said for the majority of downtown San Francisco Hotels. My room was very comfortable and sported an IPad type control screen that enabled me to adjust all the settings in the room such as lights and curtains ect. Service was outstanding and so overall a great experience.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your review of your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco. We are delighted to hear that you had a pleasant stay and appreciate your kind words regarding our staff and service. Please do not hesitate to contact me prior to your next visit as we hope to welcome you back soon.Sincerely,Anthony DugganHotel Manager415-284-4057Anthony.dugganstregis.com
1	Comfortable stay in downtown Seattle. The Grand Hyatt in downtown Seattle offers an extremely comfortable a spacious room, with a nice view from the upper floors that face west. The bathroom is large, with extremely nice shower and bathtub. The room is quiet and well insulated from sounds from other rooms, although you emergency vehicles driving can be strangely loud. You can open a small window to get some fresh air too.Thank you for your note. We love that you were able to relax and feel accommodated. Our goal is always to make our guests feel welcomed and comfortable. We hope to see you again on your next visit to Seattle.Sarah S.Guest Relations Manager
0	NOT WORTH THE MONEY!! GO ELSEWHERE!!. I have been coming to the DC area on business for the past 6 months and will continue to do so for another 6 months. I usually stay at the Homewood Suites in Springfield, however, they were completely booked for this last stay. This is the first ... and last ... time I will stay at Extended Stay America in Springfield. The hotel literally STINKS!! The lobby, the elevator and our room had various smells of smoke, body odor, curry and feet!! Daily housekeeping service is only available if you stay for a week ... unless you want to pay 15/day for it. The towels are hard, scratchy and very thin ... and the toilet paper is the same. In our full kitchen, we had 1 fork and 3 spoons. The coffee maker was on it's last leg ... and we only had 1 packet of coffee with ancient creamer whose powder was so hard it didn't even melt in the coffee. The continental breakfast was 3 thermos of coffee, a basket of apples, and stale muffins and is located on a table right next to the front door, which caused a traffic jam with people trying to get in/out of the hotel in the morning. On a positive note, the hotel staff was pleasant, the bed was nice and the location is good. Otherwise, this hotel is definitely not worth the money!!
0	Skip this place. Don't stay here unless you are desperate. The place smells like a smoking barn. The bathroom was not clean. There is no wi-fi as advertised. It was very noisy. It was unfortunate because it is located close to places we were visiting in Augusta which was very convenient, but I would never stay here again.
1	Excellent staff, fun unique hotel, perfect location!. Stayed at Hotel Diva for 3 nights June 2014 from the time we walked in I was pleased. The hotel staff are super friendly-nice people so willing to help with whatever is needed! We had a junior suite room for a group of 4 and it was really spacious the beds were really comfortable. The only thing was the bathroom was really small and thats ok but it did not have a vent it was really hard to change inside the small bathroom after taking a shower. The hotel has fun lounges loved the Perrier one so chic! It has a nice gym, staircase that you can step out on in every floor and enjoy the SF views. Loved that they had a Starbucks right next door so convinient, lots of restaurants nearby and union square just 2 blocks down. A great experience at this hotel loved it!Hi lissethg103,Thank you so much for taking the time to write such a nice review and share it with other travelers. It's so helpful for us to know what made your experience so special. Please let us know if we can be of any assistance in planning for your next trip to San Francisco. We look forward to seeing you soon!Best Regards,Dana AndrewsGuest Relations
0	Keep driving...almost anything would be better. We stayed in this place 2 years ago. We were in the front building and paid about 70. Since we were doing the Sebring 12 Hour Race, this price was reasonable even in light of what you got in the room. It was clean but dated broken furniture, very thin, chintzy towels, a paper bath mat. This year, we... More
1	Great staff, great room, great hotel!. Stayed in the Drury Inn and Suite for 2 nights over memorial day weekend and it was the best hotel i've stayed in for a long time. Our suite was huge with a large lounge, bathroom and huge floor to ceiling arced window which over looked the pool.The reception staff were always friendly and ready to help with suggestions of places to eat and really added a little extra to the stay. We were also allowed to check in at 11am without any additional cost which was really appreciated.The happy hour had a huge range and gave us the energy we needed after a day of walking NOLA's famous streets before heading out for dinner. Breakfast was also very good, with lots on offer and staff were always available to top up anything running empty.The location is great - with a street car stop right outside, altho we walked to and from the hotel to the french quartered repeatedly as it was a nice walk and only a few blocks.The rooftop pool and hot tub were perfect and always clean - the only problem was they only open them at 9am!Have only good things to say of this hotel - would book again in a second and would recommend to anyone visiting NOLA - it's a fantastic place!
1	I've Stayed at Nicer. The attention to customer service in the lobby was impeccable from the concierge to the bellman, the checkin staff and more. I was treated like I was staying a high end hotel The location is perfect if you are using the MARTA. If shopping is your thing the hotel is attached to a high end mall. They also provide shuttle service within 2 miles of the hotel. We used to to go to dinner. If was efficient and very handy. The room was just ok. I felt it should have had higher end luxuries for example: large, fluffy towels. The room was set for 2 but only had 1 bathrobe. We ate breakfast at the buffet set in the lobby. The service was marginal at best. I asked for a coffee warmup twice and had to get out of my seat to find the waiter and remind him. Certainly unacceptable service for a JW.
0	Not great for the price.. Very outdated, terrible water pressure, not enough towels in the room for a couple and the AC was very old and loud. Owner was nice but a 125 a night was way too much. If it was like 75 for the night the rating may have been better. The only reason I did not give this place one star is... More
1	Fab location good customer service.. We arrived at the beginning of July for a 7 night stay. Check in was quick staff friendly. We were upgraded to a room with a kingsize bed given free wifi on the 11th floor.Throughout our stay our room was kept spotless with fresh towels and shampoos etc refilled on a daily basis. On our last day we were able to stay in our room until 13.00hrs at no extra charge then our suitcases stored by the staff for 1 per case.We asked about purchasing a jar of cookies to bring home but unfortunately they were not available until 17.00hrs, however seeing the disappointment on our faces Jessica went the extra mile spoke with management we were able to purchase two tins We also were given a few free ones to have on our journey home!We will definitely return to this hotel when we are next back in New York. Ideal location and close enough to be within a short walk of Times Square but away from the hustle bustle of all the crowds. Thank you to all the staff at this hotel.Thanks for sharing this lovely review, Kathryn!We're thrilled to hear you enjoyed your stay with us at our prime location to Times Square. It's our pleasure to accommodate you and we appreciate your praise. Jessica is an excellent member of our team. She always goes above and beyond for our guests. You can see why we love having her here so much!We're looking forward to sharing another amazing experience with you soon. Have a beautiful day!
0	Worst Wi-Fi. Probably one of the only dealbreakers for me when I stay somewhere is when the WiFi doesn't work. I'd like it to be free, I'd like it to be fast, but if neither of those things are the case, I can deal. But the night I was there,I was never able to put together more than five minutes of uptime.... More
1	Beautiful New Orleans Hotel!. We stayed at the NOPSI Hotel for the LSU game at the Dome. It was a wonderful surprise! It was an easy walk to the Dome from the hotel. The hotel was beautiful! Our room and the bed was fantastic! The staff couldnt have been nicer or more accommodating! We couldnt have been more pleased. Will definitely stay here again on our next trip to The Big Easy!!Thank you for choosing NOPSI! It's a pleasure to learn the numerous things that made your time with us unforgettable. We look forward to welcoming you back in the future. Warm Regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager
0	It should be a Motel and not a Hotel. II have stayed at numerous hotels and I have to say that this was the worst. The water was not hot (warm at best). The heater did not work or shut off. The coffee pot and trash cans were not emptied. The shower and the sink still had water in it from whenever. The drains seemed to have been clogged.... More
1	Excellent service, nice rooms, convenient location. The location is convenient, just a few minutes walk South of Market Union Sq.The facilities rooms are very nice.The staff are excellent, as is the service.The barmen drinks are also very good.The only reason I didn't award Excellent is that the food in the restaurant at breakfast lunch was average.Also beware that certain rooms are subject to a lot of street noise.Dear Razzi-B,Thank you for sharing your review of your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco. Im pleased that you enjoyed our location, guestrooms, and service and apologize for your experience at breakfast and lunch. I encourage you to contact me directly to further discuss your stay as we hope to welcome you back soon.Sincerely,Andre BroseHotel Manager415-284-4057Andre.Brosestregis.com
0	Not a good Hilton Property. This hotel is old and it shows. They have updated some things but the layout is very inconvenient for getting in and out. The pillows are not comfortable and the toilet seat fell apart. The sofa was hard as a rock. The TV's are flat screens but the display is awful and the channels are 1980's basic cable. The internet... More
1	Good location, Safe area, Rooms are clean, comfortable, and appealing. There's cold water to refill your water bottle,. Good location, it's close to museums that I love. Rooms are clean, comfortable, and appealing, moderate size. There's cold water to refill your water bottle. The price is affordable. I felt as if it was a safe area and I had no worries or concerns about the location. I enjoyed the next door restaurant. It's an easy breakfast location.Since I was staying by myself, I would have enjoyed a movie channel to buy from but I never found it.Good coffee for the morning.Dear MarjieThank you for your review and I am so glad that we succeeded in looking after you on many area's. I have passed on your comments to our housekeeping department as we all know that providing a clean room is essential and it is something we all take great pride in.When you are next in Chicago, we would be delighted to look after you again.Kind regardsPaul Tiernan - Hotel Manager
0	Poor Quality. The Hilton Garden Inn at the Orlando airport is conveniently located. That is the only good thing I can say about it. While the room was ok, for the price I would have expected something much better. The restaurant was a joke with terrible atmosphere, slow service and extremely poor quality food.Dear guest Mark E, I really appreciate your taking the time to share your recent experience. I want to personally apologize for your inconvenience with our restaurant. We want our guests to have the best experience possible where everything exceeds their expectations. I am sorry if that was not the case during your visit. We value you as a guest, and I do want you to know that your concerns are our concerns! Should you have any question please do not hesitate to contact us at the hotel.Sincerely, Alex BlancoGeneral Manager
0	A pool, Breakfast, and, well, bugs.. Good price on the rooms, the breakfast was fine but one of the rooms had bugs. The replacement room appeared to be bug free. I won't be going back.
0	Never more. First impression was positive. However in 5 minutes I discovered that Wi-Fi doesn't work in the room. I asked a manager, she promised to repair it on the next day. I spend three nights in the hotel and nothing was changed with Wi-Fi. I had to work in garden (Wi-Fi worked outside), sometimes under grass sprinkles. Morning coffee finishes by 10 am. Living cockroaches in the room and dead in the bad. Afro-Americans knock to the door and ask for gasoline for their car because of pregnant wife. One positive point - 55 for a night, however I recommend to demolish it.
0	Not Safe and Horrible Service. My wife and I were just staying at the hotel for one night and believe me when I say I didn't expect much to begin with because you get what you pay for, which is fine.I just needed an economical stay for one night - that's all.Well this one night stay turned out to be a nightmare!1) We arrived very late because our flight got delayed into San Fran. When we finally got to the hotel it was after midnight and there was one attendant working the front desk.As he was checking us in, the hotel system went down. The man spent about 30 minutes trying to figure out what to do and could not check us in at all. When he finally had everything back up, it all went down again which led to a much longer wait just to get our room. We finally got our room key well past 1am, which was after more than an hour of waiting.2) This next issue makes the first one seem like nothing.Our room was on the 3rd floor and the next morning I wanted to go move my car closer to our room. I called up the one and only elevator they have in the place and took it down to the main floor. Well just before I got to the first floor the elevator just stopped. I realized It was stuck. It is a very small and old elevator which made me feel so claustrophobic! I pressed all the buttons trying to go back up, open the door, the alarm button and what not. I even knocked on the door and screamed for help.I was in the elevator for about 10 minutes but it seemed like an hour and no one came to my assistance. Finally I kept holding the door open button and the door opened a crack and I pushed it open the rest of the way. It was on the ground floor thankfully so I was able to walk out. I had a did that just happen moment and was in total shock.What was even more shocking was that there was a sign on the first floor noting the the elevator was out of service! That's great but where was the frickin sign on the second and third floors Who was the genius that decided one sign would be enoughI got to the front desk and spoke with the man on duty and explained the situation. All he said was that he's new and he will put signs on the other floors (better late than never) and that the manager wasn't in that day so they would reach out to me.I took the manager's email address just in case. We checked in and got the hell out of there.Well it's been a week now and I haven't heard anything from management at all. In fact I emailed them a few days ago explaining why I had such a horrible situation to give them a chance to address it and I've gotten nothing back.I realize the elevator situation and the system going down might just be bad luck but it's how the staff responded that makes me upset. Absolutely no customer service whatsoever.If you decide to stay here don't expect service you'd get from an average hotel. It's far worse.
0	Not recommended!. Our first impression should have warned us what we were getting into! The lobby was filled with OLD armchairs all of them worn out, with big slits in the upholstery and sagging seats and there were black plastic massage chairs were lined up along the outer wall. The man at reception could barely speak English.The rooms were filled with old, beat up furniture, the bathroom was small a had some mold, but it was not too bad. Although there was an ironing board in the room, there was no iron. The bed sagged in the middle and the room was not well cleaned. All in all not a comfortable feeling room or hotel. The location was not bad...there is a Dennys, IHOP and Red Lobster within walking distance. But you would be better served to book at the near-by La Quinta for the same price!
1	Top tier Motel 6 in a great location. I stay in a lot of Motel 6s and have been satisfied with just about all of them I've tried. This one is a notch above the typical Motel 6. The location is great -- I walked to World of Coca-Cola and some good restaurants -- and the free parking helps make it a real bargain. The place is clean and well maintained and t staff was pleasant and helpful. I walked both day and night and never felt in danger though I did have to deal with a couple of panhandlers. No surprise there.
0	Close to everything, but customer service is not worth it.. When we booked the hotel we requested that we have a view of the space needle When I called the day before we left to confirm our stay the woman I spoke too specifically said she was going to be the one to assign the rooms would make sure we had a view We arrived and while we checked in the front desk man seemed bothered by us. We asked where we pull up for the bell hop to help us with our bags (we were in town for a book signing, so we had boxes of books, table decorations,gifts etc.) Not to mention we were staying for a week so we had quite a few bags. We were told
0	Very dirty! Avoid at all cost!. Room was very dirty, pillow cases stained, bathroom nasty, and outdated and we cancelled and decided not to stay at all! the first room we were given ...the key didnt work and so the front desk reassigned us another room.
1	Pleasing return visit as expected.. This is the second time that we have stayed at this hotel and the refurbishment is now complete. All rooms have been completely renovated so they are very clean and come with a shower , modern TV and coffee maker. the rooms are abit on the small side but big enough to take two double beds. The staff are very frienly and helpful and encourage you to use the business centre if you need to. There is also a gym and a small heated pool which doesn't seem to get too busy. The breakfast is included free and it does provide you with an adequate start to the day if you require a big vried breakfast there are severl restaurants offering all you can get buffets close by. The hotel is in a great location and does offer great value for money including free parking , in room wifi and an ATM.We are so glad you have enjoyed two visits with us at the Best Western Plus Orlando Convention Center. We love to hear from guests that have experienced our upgrades in the past year. The hotel has been completely renovated and is now one of the newest hotels in the Orlando area. We appreciated your business and look forward to seeing you again on your next Florida trip!
1	French quarter easy access. Needed a place to stay for just one night with the family to be fairly close to MSY but also check out the NOLA scene for first time in my life..It was easy to find . The Parking was very accessible whcih seems like a premium in this area . It was on the edge of the of the neighborhood and just a very easy walk to Bourban street ..So it was good to be close but not in an overlly intense environment..perfect for a family to experience the flavor but not get to caught up in the insanity . It was a great experience and would highly recommend this hotel. Staff was great without exception . Room was small..but hey it's the French Quarter and we weren't looking to do aerobics in the room . .Dear Guest, I was glad to hear your stay in New Orleans was enjoyable and that you would recommend our hotel in the future. Thank you for reviewing our hotel.Thank You, Bryant Faul
1	One of the Nicest Renaissance's. A relatively large convention type hotel. One of the best concierge lounges (for those of you staying on that level or elite Marriott travelers). I stayed here twice and both times the rooms were spacious, quiet and everything worked the way it was supposed to. Once I was a bit too close to the service elevator, but even that wasn't noisy (I like quiet). Didn't try the health club, but I did enjoy the hotel's main restaurant and lounge. The food in both was better than average. On the negative side...it's just the price. If you don't book this property well in advance or have a great corporate rate, you're going to pay well to stay here. If you can get a room at a reasonable rate, I'd recommend it. If you need to book a room at the last minute...go elsewhere.Thank you very much for the feedback on my hotel, I am glad you enjoyed your stay and hope to see you back soon!
1	Great rooms and service. Awful Spectators bar/food. The hotel has lovely quiet rooms always cleaned and polished. The staff are friendly and efficient. Even on busy memorial weekend the place did not feel too crapped or rushed. It's sad to see their luxury 'Skies' rooftop revolving restaurant has gone bust.We had to eat dinner the first night at the 'Spectator's' bar which was awful. We went back for drinks later at night and the main bartender was rude, he fitted right into the ambiance of this nasty little nugget.The breakfast buffet is always one of the highlights of my stay at this establishment. It's reasonably priced with top quality selection and service. The terrace view is calming with all the trees and water fountains babbling in the background.The pool was just 'remodeled' for memorial weekend but as always it was over packed and there were about 15 chaise lounge chairs for a large hotel. The hotel must buy some chairs for the clients. We had to sit on the concrete both days with our 2 year old. Next time we will bring our own chairs.I talked to the staff who said the entire hotel is in a remodel phase and I'm sure they will address these minor details. I may have griped a bit that I still love the hotel it just needs some minor adjustments. If your with family and need a dinner just go down to the Westin through The Link they have a bar/restaurant that actually has main courses and cooked food with vegetables.
0	Bad experience. We stayed here after a long day of travel. I booked through a 3rd party on my phone, then went out to dinner in Savannah, drove the distance to Kingland, and checked in late.

1	Exceptional Customer Service. I want to thank all of the staff at the Estancia for the wonderful service for our meeting we had in April. Even with the additional guest due to the fires they were accommodating and very friendly. My daughter and I, along with a friend and her daughter stayed and additional two days to have a little vacation before her wedding in June, We had a massage planned and just relaxing by the pool. My daughter spotted a bathing suit cover up, purchased it and wore it during her bachelor party in Cabo two week later. She lost it and loved it. I called Estancis spa t and spoke to Heather ( who had helped us previously with our massage and the purchase of the coverup), she remembered exactly who we were and which one. They did not have anymore but was able to get the designer name, look it up on line and find the exact one! She gave me all this information so I could purchase another one and surprise my daughter. This is going above and beyond! We will be coming back again and certainly will go to the spa again! Thank you Heather!! Thank you Deb and Sarah!Thank you for taking the time to share your wonderful experience on Trip Advisor. Your review gives us the opportunity to specifically praise and congratulate our well-deserved staff for providing exceptional experiences! We are pleased to hear Heather was able to assist with your purchase and make a connection with her guests. We look forward to welcoming you again soon!
1	Consistently good service and updated infrastructure. After several trips to Atlanta (Smyrna region), this hotel has consistently delivered excellent service. The atrium is quite impressive and sometimes generates noise (one of the few negative points) but the meeting infrastructure, the rooms itself, the restaurant (Medici and Tosca Blu), the spa and fitness, swimming pool, easy access to Cumberland mall...(should I go on) make this property one of the best business hotels in the neighbourhood. Best is of course in a renovated room and with your access to the lounge but that will depend on you. Pricing however is a tad higher than other properties which is why I marked it a bit lower in value.Thank you so much for your feedback, I really appreciate it. Hope to see you back with us soon!
1	Definitely recommend. The rooms were clean and beds extremely comfortable. Hot breakfast and dinner every day....dinner consisted of baked potato, cheddar cheese sause, hot dogs, salad and carrots, celery sticks every night. In addition, each night, there was at least one or more additional items - nachos/chicken tenders/etc. We arrived early in the morning and they were able to give us our room which was extremely nice. Staff was EXCELLENT. Every staff member we came in contact with was extremely helpful and friendly. Shuttle was efficient - ran every half hour.Only negativesThe pool was ok...a little smaller than pictured and chilly but the room was heated and the indoor/outdoor feature was nice. On the sunny days, outside pool was nice. The room had a desk, reclining chair and two dressers. Would have preferred a table with chairs over the 2nd dresser so we could play games in the room. Not a real problem....we just went to the lobby and used the tables there. Biggest complaint was with Travelocity. They were supposed to reserve a double bed room and booked us into a single king. My grandson was coming up for the weekend from his military base so it presented a little bit of a problem for one night. Their comment was they couldn't guarantee the room and we would just have to see if we could talk to the front desk. There were several soccer ball teams here when we checked in so there were no roll-away beds. We made do but it would have been better if they had made the reservation correctly to begin with. Will not book through them again.Overall...excellent experience. Even though there were several high school aged groups who were there during our stay...room was very quiet and no complaints with noise and everything was clean and well stocked.
1	New favorite in the city. I have stayed at a bunch of places in Seattle over the past 20+ years and my favorites have changed as staff, ownership, dating, maintenance, etc change. For years it was the Alexis then the Fairmont and Four Seasons then The Inn at the Market. the past few years we have stayed at the Hyatt but I thought I would try the Sorrento this weekend as I found a 249 suite deal. The rooms were huge and perfectly maintained and appointed. We loved having a book shelf filled with real books. The common areas were great and I honestly love a hotel where you can actually use the stairs anytime not just when the hotel is on fire. The staff was super friendly and helpful. This is our new favorite.Wow, parisryan, you know your Seattle hotels! I am thrilled that we are on the top of that prestigious list. Real books, real stairs, and super friendly staff, we have it all! Please come back and visit us again soon, we would be delighted to welcome you back. Cheers!Angie M. MykelGeneral Manager- Hotel Sorrento
0	OH. HELL. NO.. Unacceptable, unprofessional behavior.1. Couldn't get into room because I wasn't on the reservation. 2. Person let into room who wasn't on the reservation.3. Unreliable housekeeping.4. Double-charged for entire stay... WHEN I WASN'T EVEN ON THE RESERVATION.So, to begin... My friend PREPAID with her card for a room for us to share, but requested that my name be added to the reservation since I would arrive in NOLA hours before her. There's a whole email trail to prove they agreed, had my name spelled correctly, etc. I arrived, and they're like who are you I'm tired. I've been traveling. I need to shower, but no. I can't get into the room until hours later when my friend lands and gets it sorted from her Uber. I check us in using my card for incidentals, saying they'd only put a 50 hold on my card if we charged something to the room (we didn't). My friend arrives three hours later, but basically gets into our room about 15 minutes after I do. Once she's there, she tells me a pretty funny story. Her bf and his friends had another room, and even though he never put them on the reservation at all, they gave them keys! I had documentation and couldn't get into my room, and they, complete strangers for all the hotel knows, just waltzed into theirs! A huge security issue!The room itself was nice enough, and so was the pool however, the pool bar closed at random times despite having official posted hours. The bartenders were rude, as was most of the hotel staff (except for the doormen, who were delightful). Our room was only cleaned half the days of our stay. Housekeeping didn't replenish the toiletries when they did clean the room, and with two women, we obviously ran out of shampoo. When we called the front desk, around 10pm, they said they'd run out! At 11pm they came with a bag (and I mean garbage bag) full of.... lotion Because that helps. So both my friend and I showered without washing our hair, only to have housekeeping show up again at 2AM IN THE MORNING, banging on the door, with one bottle of shampoo that I guess they found. Not only was it late, but it was LATE.And now the worst part, to top it all off: Remember when I wasn't even on the reservation Yeah, they charged my credit card on file for a temporary hold FOR THE ENTIRE STAY. After my friend HAD ALREADY PREPAID. They got their before we even stepped in the door, and then double charged a completely different credit card with a completely different name. Yeah, no. You can deal with my credit card company thanks. I'm giving them two stars instead of one because the doormen were so incredibly nice. The nicest I've ever met. They should all get bonuses.And some additional minor points:Doormen: SO NICE! I LOVED THEM!Housekeeping: Good job cleaning WHEN they cleaned (but didn't restock soaps)Pool: Small but really nice, great viewBars: Rude, closed for no reasonFood: GreatBed: ComfortableBathroom: AwesomeNoise level: LOUD but it's not the soundproofing. It's the crazy loud fan/vent.Location: GREATOverall cleanliness: GREATThank you for taking a moment to share your review on TripAdvisor. Your candid feedback is truly valuable. I am disappointed to learn of issues you encountered during your stay as well as the service that should have been executed flawlessly. My apologies for your experience and I hope you will allow us another opportunity to serve you. Warm regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager
1	Weekend at the ball game. When we booked the hotel we knew that they were undergoing renovations so we expected some inconvenience. The checkin area was in a different location, all you needed to do was follow the signs. Checkin was fast. Our room was a 2 bedroom suite with a king in each room. The room was recently renovated and was absolutley beautiful. Plenty of room for 4 adults. We will be reserving a room again next September. There is shopping, food an liquor store right around the corner. The only downside was that our room was directly under the temporay breakfast cafe. If possible, that should be the last room to be checked into.
1	A Jewel in La Jolla. Excellent location and most friendly staff. We had a very confortable suite that can accommodate 4 people. The living room had a window with full ocean view. Very clean property, nice breakfast included in the price. Parking and internet was also included. Most important, the staff was very friendly and helpful.Greetings Alfredo L,Thank you for taking the time to review Pantai Inn. On behalf of the team, we all enjoyed reading your positive comments about our Inn. We are all very fortunate to be in a wonderful location, have well appointed rooms, and all work together with the common goal of ensuring our guests satisfaction. I sincerely appreciated you pointing out the complimentary items included with your stay - daily breakfast, parking, and wifi. Also, thank you for naming us the jewel in La Jolla. The name La Jolla roughly translates to this as well. We are all eager for your return. Cheers! Mike

1	Clean as a whistle. Had a four night stay at the Cabrillo in early May 2010. The room was extremely clean, so much so that we had to keep the windows open to let the cleaning fragrance escape! I guess you should never complain about a place being too clean. The room included a complimentary hot breakfast but did not include parking. The hotel was a bit away from San Diegos centre but it was definitely within walking distance for us. If not for others, the trolley and bus stop is only a block away. The staff member at the front desk was very helpful with information regarding maps, transport, food and places to steer clear from. The nightly rate was 150USD, maybe a little pricey for what we got but we enjoyed the stay overall. We were there to see San Diego after all, not the four walls of the Best Western. Still, I would recommend this hotel if you didnt mind being just out of the very centre of the city.
0	Don't get a wake up call!. Overall, the rooms are pretty nice, but my experience this time was not. First, I requested wake-up calls at 6:30 and 6:40 AM. I didn't get either. My phone did ring at 6:45, but I had already shot out of bed at 6:43 when I saw the clock. When I told the front desk how upset I was, I didn't... More
0	STAY far away from this place. Booked over the phone. Asked if they were pet friendly and the lady said yes. Drove 5 hours to get here and then be told no cats allowed. Would not cancel nor refund the reservation. Called my bank to stop payment and dispute the charge. Very unfriendly staff. Not a good experience
0	Cardboard window. Disappointed with the condition of the hotel. One of the rooms we booked had cardboard and tape covering the window. The refrigerator was not working and spoiled the food we put in it. No manager on duty and the manager is slow to respond. Several days later they responded they were sorry by email, however its been 2 weeks now and no further response on making right the situation.Dear Jeff R,Thank you for your recent review. The primary AC unit had failed. So we placed a temporary unit in the room. This was the reason for why the tape and cardboard. It was repaired upon check out. I did not get a notification on the fridge not working during your stay. I do apologize for both of these issues you had. These are not common occurrences as you can tell by other reviews on this site. If you would can you call me at the hotel and we can speak more about thisKindest regards,Robert HumphreyGeneral Manager
0	Boeves Cabin. We recently rented the Boeves cabin at the Flying Arrow resort. The cabin is in a great location and has a deck overlooking the river which is very nice. With that being said, I would not rent it again. The upstairs which has 2 bedrooms is hard to get to having to having to make your way up stairs that... More

0	Terrible Service. Would not stay here again. We arrived at the hotel around 12 noon. We were told their were no rooms ready and to come back in a couple hours. We returned in a couple hours but room not ready yet. We waited 3 1/2 hours for a room. We then got the room directly across from the elevator. The door wouldn't open. Very noisy trying to sleep. Breakfast was not good. Coffee maker broken. Manager finally talked to us after waiting 3 1/2 hours and gave us a discount. We cancelled our stay and moved hotels. Best choice ever! Best part was shuttle driver Travis. Loved him!
1	Comfortable and Cozy near the Boardwalk. This best western is the next best thing to the casino maybe even equal comfort that's close to the boardwalk. I have been staying at this location for years. I even have a favorite room. They since have remodeled and it's really nice modern decor. It's generally inexpensive, but can sometimes be the same rate as the casinos because of its popularity. I always enjoy my stay and it's close to everything. One block from the boardwalk. There is a seven eleven across the street that has everything. There is a rite aid, liquor store, restaurants and laundromat few steps away. Highly recommend this location and nice staff in the lobby.
0	DISAPPOINTING DO NOT RECOMMEND IT. I usually not write reviews that often and especially don't give any bad review to ARIA at all since my husband totally loves ARIA. My husband and I always love to stay here and we come minimum 3 times a year but the last 2 stays of ours were very unsatisfactory and all due to unprofessional staff at Mlife. My... More
1	Perfect hotel for my birthday girls only week-end!. This hotel had it all... outstanding and personable service and quality furnishings (though I understand they are remodeling to make it even better!) Lively complimentary cocktail hour including pub games.Gorgeous pool area with poolside food and bar service and all i an idyllic location in the Gaslamp quarter! Would stay here again and again!Well Angie H...we would love to welcome you back again and again! Thank you for the phenomenal 5 star review! I truly appreciate to taking time to write about your experience. We can't wait to have you back again..hopefully soon! Cheers! Shannon
1	started off rough but ended great. My first night at the hotel was terrible. I had to call security due to the very loud and rowdy people on my hall. I felt like I was in the middle of a house party, which was not okay at 2:30am! The next morning I promptly called the front dest at 8am and requested a new room. I explained what had happened and they couldn't have been nicer about the situation. They promptly moved me to a new room on the concierge floor, and they also gave me complementary breakfast for the remainder of my stay.As a Marriott rewards member I was please to see how professionally they handled this issues I had and made them right. The complementary shuttle service the hotel offers is a huge help when trying to get to dinner reservations and shopping. The restaurant and bar are also nice, they also have a great workout room. The location is ideal for a trip to Atlanta. Great hotel!I am so very sorry to learn of the noise disturbance you experienced on your first night. I am glad we were able to accommodate you in another room. Rest assured we are also following up with our Loss Prevention team to ensure we making extra rounds in the evening hours to ensure there are not noise disturbances for our guests. I do hope you plan to visit us again. Thank you for letting us know.
1	Terrific experience. The other reviews here on Tripadvisor are very accurate, and helped us choose this hotel, hopefully I can add some additional comments of value. The hotel is super clean, modern and up to date. That it is actually an older building is completely invisible unless you look really hard. The front desk staff are all super nice and accomodating.Valet parking is the way to go. 2/day more than finding your own, the cars are kept right at the back door of the lobby, and a valet was always available. Worth every penny.The rooms are compact to be sure, but hey, you're in Hawaii, and you need to be outdoors! The rooms reminded me a lot of a typical cruise ship in square footage and furnishings, which is a compliment. Like a lot of european hotels, the A/C is controlled by your room key which you insert into the light switch next to the door. Took a moment to figure that out, but once we did, it was nice, helped keep us from losing our key, and I appreciated the energy-conserving feature. Yes, there is a truly crappy building that needs to be torn down/blown up or something next to it, but its hardly a dealbreaker. The rooftop pool is nifty, relatively private and appeared to be as well maintained as the rest of the place. The location is pretty darn awesome for not being on 'the strip'. Short walk to pretty much anything, bus stop on the corner, fun/weird/cheap breakfast place also at corner. There is a bar for anyone's taste or interest within a block or two. Lots of shopping from the lowest to highest end within a block or two. Very eclectic.The attached Mexican restaurant was quite good and reasonably priced.Cab drivers have no idea where this hotel is located. 3 tries, 3 cabs, and they all got lost. Either the recent name change or the one-way street the hotel is on threw them off. We found it more funny than annoying as cabs in Honolulu are plentiful, reasonably priced and driven just as horrifically as in any city.Aloha KurtS84!Thank you so much for the terrific comments and 5-star review! Your comments are very thoughtful and I appreciate you taking the time to post. Our intimate rooftop pool is one of my favorite amenities because you get such an amazing view in a very relaxed setting. Come back and see us again the next time you visit Honolulu!Mahalo!Brian AkerDirector of Rooms
0	THE WORST EXPERIENCE. I don't recommend anyone to stay there! Because this is the most awful hotel in Wisconsin Dells! Poor service! Disgusting rooms not clean! Noizy! hole on the walls! Don't visit this hotel! NEver ever ever
1	Very Clean, Good Food, Nice Neighborhood. We came as a group on business. The rooms are large, there is a nice desk for working, the complimentary Internet speed was ok, but I couldn't figure how to get the better speed once I had signed up for the complimentary. The breakfast is great and fast. The neighborhood was a great place to go for a run.Thank you for your marvellous remarks regarding your recent group stay at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport while on business. I am very pleased to read that you were impressed with your immaculate, spacious accommodation, the food we served, our convenient location and all the complimentary features we have to offer. My team have a great passion for what they do, so I will share your feedback with them to recognize their hard work. Thank you again, and we hope that you and your group will visit us again soon!All the Best,Debra Thompson-FrenchGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport
1	Great room for the price. I stayed at the Virginian Suites for one night in February and I was overall impressed with the hotel. It's a little difficult to get to if you don't know the area, but it's very convenient to restaurants and Georgetown, it would probably be a nice walk in the spring/summer. I stayed in a studio suite and there was a full kitchen with dishes and cooking utensils and it was very clean. There was a flat screen tv and couch. (A bit uncomfortable though). The bed was comfortable with high quality sheets. The bathroom was clean, but a bit small. There is a lot of storage and a large closet, so it would be a good place to stay for an extended period of time. The staff was very attentive, and the Washington Post was delivered in the morning. The only complaints I have are that the internet password did not work (though I'm sure this could have been fixed had I bothered to call the front desk), the small bathroom, and the fact that you have to pay for parking (7 a night). Other than that, I definitey recommend this hotel!
1	The perfect beach experience!. I recently stayed here while vacationing with my significant and was pleasantly surprised by the experience. We had a room with an excellent view overlooking the boardwalk and beach. It was great to sit out on the balcony and be able to enjoy the view and action down below. The hotel and room were clean and up-to-date. The bed was extremely comfortable with quality linens. The location was decent, located along the boardwalk with a number of restaurants, shops, and other hotels. Once we were there, we didn't have to drive anywhere since there was enough to keep us entertained close by.The only downside was that it was a bit noisy at night. There were a few people from the nearby bars yelling on the sidewalk, but fortunately it was brief and not late enough to wake us up. Also, the waves were much louder than we'd expected while trying to sleep, but that wasn't the fault of the hotel. Might be something to keep in mind if you are looking for a beach-front hotel. However, overall it was a fabulous experience!Thank you so much for the great TA review! It is great to hear you had a good time in Pacific Beach and enjoyed your room.On your next visit, if you'd like to be placed in the more quiet area of the hotel, please include it in your notes sections when booking your stay, we apologize for the unwanted noise level.We hope to have you back soon! Thanks for spending time at Ocean Park Inn.
0	Disaster. Avoid. Nothing good to say. The list goes on and on. Beds not made, no toilet paper, botched room assignments, mixed-up special events. The parking lot has recently been re-paved, everything else is broken. Something is wrong at the top here as evidenced by the total disorganization.
1	Great location, clean, friendly staff, but wifi needs serious upgrade. This was our 2nd time staying at Ocean Park Inn. Again, we stayed in a 2nd floor ocean front room. Great location, right on Pacific Beach. Very comfortable, fabulous ocean and beach views, balcony with small table and chairs overlook the beach. Unlike last visit, this time the wireless internet was completely useless in our room. I mean like non-existent. I had to go to the lobby to use wifi. Pretty inconvenient. They likely need to install few more routers. This reminded me of the state of things 10 years ago,when you'd wander around a hotel with your laptop, trying to find where you could actually get a wifi signal.. Spacious bathroom was renovated since last visit: bathtub removed and replaced with very spacious shower stall. Lots of drawers, decent closet -easy to keep organized. Pool, hot tub and patio area were great: impeccably clean: Staff were often out there picking up towels and tidying up. We swam in the ocean everyday, used the pool and hot tub every day. Very friendly staff. Location is as good as it gets: right on the beach, and walking distance to dozens of restaurants, bike rentals, coffee shops, and beach-and-souvenir shops. A Ralph's supermarket is a 3 minute walk away -great for lunch fixings, fresh fruit or a quick dinner from the deli counter. Free breakfast on site was good:: kids like to make their own waffles, good selection of yogurt, bagels, cream cheese, hard-boiled eggs, fresh fruit, toast, jams and cereals, coffee, juice, milk. Never used the air-conditioner: enjoyed sleeping with sliding doors open, fresh sea breeze and the soothing sound of ocean all night. Not a luxury hotel, but it has everything you need, except useful wifi, is very quite and clean, has friendly staff and location couldn't be better. Teenage kids would like to return a 3rd time, maybe next year.Thank you for all of your positive feedback, we are so glad that we had the opportunity to welcome you back!I have wonderful news, we are currently working on upgrading our Internet. On your next visit to the Ocean Park Inn it will be running much quicker so you will have more time to enjoy relaxing out on your ocean view patio!
0	1st and Last Stay!. The lobby looked nice and half way updated.

1	Stay here!!!. You do not want to miss this gem! From the moment you enter the front door to the time you leave the experience is like none other in NOLA. Beautiful hotel, great staff, rooms are perfectly cozy and a little like Vegas. Rooftop bar ambiance is clutch with a great view! Quiet and perfectly locatedThank you so much for taking the time to share this rave review of our hotel. We love hearing compliments such as this and how our property, service, and amenities created such a wonderful experience. It was our pleasure to have you as our guests and do hope to have you back for another visit real soon.Best regards,
1	A family of four looking to get away.. Bad: Parking is probably the only downside. You have to park in a parking garage which is fine, but expensive. But I guess thats what you get for staying in the city. It was all worth it though because the location was amazing. Good: The location is amazing. We were able to walk to everything. The room was clean and comfortable for my family of 4. The free breakfast was also great. We had an issue with internet that was taken care of really quickly. We had a great time and look forward to staying again
1	Atlanta adventure. The rooms were great. Breakfast was not well stocked so not much available if you were not there right away! Biggest complaint was both our rooms were not ready at check in! One of them wasn't ready until 5 pm! Not cool after a day of traveling! Dear amyh6751RH, I want to take this opportunity to apologize for the poor service you received during your stay at the BRAND of Wyndham. Your experience with our BRAND was not the quality of service that we have promised to provide to our guests. Our BRAND promise is something that we strive to deliver to every guest every day. There is no excuse that our staff did not fulfill that promise in your case. Please accept our apologies. Thank you for choosing BRAND and I look forward to the opportunity to better serve you in the future!!!!Gratefully, Tremeil Boone Assistant Manager

1	Canelled Flight. Our flight was cancelled and we went to another facility and found it unfavorable. We called Hampton Inn and they had accommodations. they got us in fast, were professional, sympathetic, and helpful. We appreciated too that the towel with Hershey Kisses made it feel inviting and like home. A warm welcome. Our flight was scheduled to the next day and they allowed us to stay in the room until 1:30 pm then remain in the lobby/breakfast area until we were ready to go. We felt safe.Thank you for your kind words and feedback in regards to your recent stay at the Hampton Inn Philadelphia Airport. We look forward to a serving you again soon if your travels should bring you back to Philadelphia.Director of Sales

1	Wonderful place to stay!. We took a family trip to Atlanta. This is a very nice hotel with exceptional staff. Rooms were large with an excellent view of the downtown. Weekend rates are very reasonable. It is very convenient to MARTA right across the street.Thank you for bring your family to visit us at the JW Marriott Atlanta. We have a beautiful city and I am glad you were able to enjoy a skyline view. Being located across the street from the MARTA rail system is certainly convenient to many of our Atlanta attractions. I hope you and your family will plan to visit again.
1	Location is Everything. This hotel is on a well-known avenue and literally across Lake Union. You can see from your hotel room window all of the lake tours available and boats to rent. So many people walking, jogging, and biking around the lake. Make sure you go for a lake view room. Just down the street there are some good places to eat like a BBQ place and Art Mable 21 restaurant. The staff is the best, very helpful and friendly. What I enjoyed the most was their breakfast Acai bowl, so good and an energy boost to start the day right. WiFi is always free and I had no issues.Dear EndyBOSTON,Thank you for sharing your feedback! I am glad to hear that you enjoyed your time at our hotel with the surrounding area being active and upbeat, matching the mood and view of the beautiful Lake Union. The Bistro's Acai Bowls are the best and I'm happy you had a chance to enjoy them at the top of your morning here. We pride ourselves with our staff service and hospitality, so knowing that we were able to take care of our loyal guests, like you, is an absolute delight! Can't wait to have you staying with us again whenever your travels bring you back to Seattle.In hospitality,Alina C.

Shower cubicle was spacious. Toiletries included. Not the best of locations in San Fran but by far not the worst either. We enjoyed the walk to Fishermans Wharf. There's a hop-on-hop-off bus stop fairly close too. Great value for money Dear Kate G,Thank you for choosing the Hotel Vertigo during your recent visit to San Francisco.

1	Good Stay Mothersday weekend not crowded. Hotel felt very mellow, We hardly saw anyone in the hotel. Ruths Chris has a good happy hour,cheap drinks and apps .We checked in Saturday and were given a room on the 20th floor. Room was nice and modern. Bed was comfortable, roon had what we needed. Room rate of 143 and tax was 22 a day kind of nuts but oh well. This hotel is in a great locatio...close to everything Pikes Place Market, light rail station, monorail, bars with happy hour. Theight rail station to airport is only two blocks up. We also relaxed in the hot tub which was relaxing. Overall good stay , not crowded, great location, and nice rooms.
1	Friendly, warm, courteous and efficient staff with nicely decorated comfy rooms.... The title may have said it all...It was a nicely decorated room and very comfortable. The cleaning staff was very conscious of when I would leave and come clean the room. They are very pet friendly there and you can't tell a pet has ever stayed in there it is so clean. The desk staff, concierge and valet parking are all efficient, knowledgeable and friendly. I have stayed at two other hotels in this group: Kensington Park and Hotlel Union Square and they are all good experiences but this is the first time I have traveled since I have my dog and I was so pleased...
1	great Hotel Experience. This was a beautiful hotel. All the things that made it a bank are still there, reminding you of the lovely banks that we used to have. The fact that part of the building is still an operating bank was a surprise. Everything was lovely. I did not eat in the restaurant because the rest of my party wanted to go other places , but we should have eaten there. We went to Mother's we had the worst meal that any of us ever had. I would highly recommend this hotel for a great stay its location.We're so happy to hear you enjoyed your stay at the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans and we appreciate the great review. We look forward to hosting your next stay, feel free to contact us for future reservations.Thank you, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
1	charming french quarter hotel. this hotel is lovely! tucked away on decatur it is centrally located to anything you wanna do in the quarter. the staff was superfriendly housekeeping included. the rooms are styled old fashioned and the bathrooms were really big in comparison with room size. the sundecks were so pretty that we will definitely stay in a sundeck room next time. my husband and i love finding little gems like this in the city. definitely a romantic place too.We are so glad you had such a great stay!! Please come back and see us again soon for another great trip to New Orleans.
0	No sleep. Did not sleep.. sadly when we arrived this hotel was directly the msin hotel affected by the construction and its crew, that was performed during the whole night, made our short trip to the beach a sadly terrible one
0	Poor cleaning. Hi, my family and I were having a vacation at Walt Disney World so I decided to stay in Baymont Hotel only for it's photos that can be found online because there was a lot of hotels with the same price per night in the city. First, there was a misunderstanding of the people that made my reservation that were more focused in grabbing your money out of your pocket than helping and listening to the guest. They were pushing me so hard to reserve a room instantly that they did not hear when I said 2 nights. When I got to the hotel, The front desk agent helped me to get another night that wasn't in the reservation. The hotel was nothing to do with the online photos. The carpet was old, stained, dusty, and had bad odors the Lobby was dark. When I got to the room It was disappointed. The whole room stink, the carpet was all dirty and stained. The furniture old and scratched. Bathroom with hair in the floor, towels with holes. Beds were full size not queen. Pillows small and flat. Also I visited the pool which was dirty and with tree leafs in the bottom. I took breakfast in the morning it was small, No eggs, sausage, bacon, milk, only a basic breakfast. What I did like was the quietly of the room the friendly staff, nothing else. I will not come back again to this hotel, and I can not recommend it to anybody. Sorry, that's the very true. Sincerely Mr. Morales ( Security Manager of MIA Hotel)Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for your constructive feedback. Our intent is to give great quality at minimal cost to you our valued guest. We ask that you please bare with us as we continue to improve the quality of our hotel while we are undergoing renovations. Our ultimate goal is to provide all of our guests with enjoyable, and memorable stays! So we look forward to having an opportunity to make your next stay just that! Thank you for your patience once again and we hope to see you soon.
0	Days Inn at Fayetteville AK. Rude man at check in, no cable or internet for 1 1/2 days, dirty sheets, staff not helpful, no coffee, horrible stay!!
0	Shabby and outdated. Although the lobby of the hotel is nice, beyond that is a dated, tired hotel. We arrived earlier than check-in so went up to the pool deck. Lounge chair covers were stained in the private seating areas. Main deck chairs were old and dingy. Cigarette butts from the night before were still on the pool deck. Check in finally came at 3:30. There were over 55 people in line waiting and two people behind the desk checking us in. When we finally got our room in the Annex, we quickly turned around and went back down to the lobby to change it. First off, the elevator to the Annex is behind the desk of the diner and it looks like it was once the service elevator. We heard the Annex had been an old Holiday Inn. The hallway lights were partially burned out, the carpet was frayed and dated and the room smelled like disinfectant and the carpet was damp (don't know with what). The wall had a hole in it the dresser drawer was cracked and falling apart and the bathroom tiles were broken in spots. Our next room had a nice balcony with a view of the spa pool in the same worn out Annex. The spa pool was dirty and were were told that someone had thrown a glass bottle into it a couple of days back and they were waiting for a diver to come and take out the pieces of glass so they could clean it. The room didn't smell but the sliding door to the balcony was off the track so it wouldn't open and the wall had a missing large picture (someone had painted around it at one point and you could see the outline of the picture) and there was a large hole in the wall that had been covered up with electrical tape. The only bright spot was Bob, the maintenance person, who brought us a painting to cover the wall and fixed our door. Obviously the hardest working man at the Chelsea! All in all, the worst hotel room I've ever stayed in and will never return to the Chelsea. I live outside of Philadelphia and travel to Atlantic City a lot. This was my worst trip to date.
1	Stay to have Surgery. Was at the Inn while having Knee replacement at the Virginia Mason Hospital (which the Inn is a part of. When I got to room it was all set up for my post op. Staff is very warm and friendly. My whole experience was beyond anything I had expected. Room service comes from the hospital and the price can't be beat. If your there for Tourist stuff you might be surprised. If your there as an extended patient as I was then you'll enjoy the local and people.Good Afternoon and thank you for your review. It was nice to hear you enjoyed your stay. We have re-opened the caf in the lobby and hope you'll come back and give it a try. Until then. . .safe travels!
1	Diva-rific!. From the wonderful greeting of the front desk staff to the comfortable bed in my quiet room, I loved every second of my stay! I was surprised coz I did not expect the room to be spacious enough! The hotel is walking distance to lots of restaurants, shopping, entertainment and the train station! And how wonderful it is that Union Square is just a block away!Wow! Thank you for taking the time to share this fabulous stay with us! We are thrilled to hear you loved our friendly staff, central location and comfy beds! Your feedback means a lot to us and we hope to welcome you back in the near future. Thanks again.
0	Poor service and food isn't good. We asked in the morning about breakfast and they told us that a free continental breakfast is only served at a holiday in express.  Then we ordered our breakfast.  When the food arrived the food orders were small and not cooked properly.  For the price we paid for breakfast we could have gone to a nice restaurant in town and the food would have been better and more plentiful. Then when checking out holiday Inn charged us an additional fee.
0	New Year's Experience. This room was not clean. There was some red, bloody looking prints on the bathroom door. Also, the dressing and bathroom area was very un-suitable! The bathroom had a sink with no counter around it. So, all my stuff had to be some place other than where I needed them (like my contact lense items, make-up, etc. Then, when you got into the actual bathroom, there was no surface to place anything on, or any hooks to hold your towel. The room was for a handicapped person, but, even a handicapped person needs a surface to hold their towel and clothes. Even the toilet did not have a lid. So, you went in there and where was your towel and clothes to be This room was a disaster. Then, we stayed there on New Years Eve and left on New years day. We left at around 10 am. There was no breakfast. When I asked, they said that breakfast ended at 9:30 am because it was a weekday. I told them it was a National Holiday and they said that they do not celebrate or acknowledge the National Holiday of New Years day. So that was that! We were not pleased!! And will never stay there!!
1	Great Vacation Hotel and Spa. In March 2013, I spent a long weekend at Estancia and really, really, really enjoyed it. The food, in particular, was delicious at every meal. Everything appeared and tasted fresh, whole, and real. The spa was lovely and all employees were true professionals and excellent at their craft. Also, notable was the valet staff who always took good care of us coming and going. We also enjoyed the hot tub, especially on cool March evenings. I used a Romance Rendezvous Package that, upon checkout, I was please to discover was truly an excellent value -- the bill could have been much higher, but it wasn't. I highly recommend Estancia to anyone looking for a lovely, romantic getaway at a fair value.Thank you for writing a review about your stay last March. We are so glad to hear that you enjoyed the Romance Rendezvous Package and that you had such a pleasant experience at our wonderful Spa. Thank you for recommending our hotel and spa to others and we hope to welcome you back very soon.
1	Wonderful staff and comfortable rooms. The staff at this Comfort Inn is wonderful. They are always very accommodating with us and help us out. We've stayed here more than once but always in room 201. It's a very nice room, it's clean, and the beds are comfortable. The included breakfast is quite good for a free breakfast and my nieces love the waffles! My nieces also love their pool! It's pretty average size for a hotel but big enough for us. Marzoni's is just across the parking lot which is great for us because it is our favorite restaurant in the Altoona area.
1	Socks needed. I would not recommend walking in the room barefoot, I tried my feet always needed to be washed before bed. We did appreciate the free bottled water each day, much better than trying to go through TSA. :)Glad you enjoyed our extra detail of including water bottles for our guests. Thank you for sharing your experience with us and for choosing Ramada Limited San Diego. We apologize that you had to wash your feet before bed and we will look into changing our cleaning products to ensure they are not leaving residue on the floor. We would love to host you again during any future visits to San Diego!
1	Overpriced Pleasant Getaway. My husband and I stayed for three nights for a wedding on the property. The pros: the service - from the front desk and their complimentary champagne to the concierge but the best were the valet: they were the most courteous, prompt and thoughtful gentlemen we encountered. It did not take long for them to get our cars (we called ahead as they suggested). They were so kind to give us complimentary bottles of water. Our favorite place to hang out during the day was at the hot tub (it was too cold for the pool) and at night, we sat by the firepit with the complimentary bottle of wine. I also loved that we received water everyday (However, the water, the wine, the internet is a charge of 22 per day). The cons: the food and spa was overpriced for average quality. We don't mind paying for premium services, but we also expect premium services and cleanliness. The women's outdoor whirlpool area could use a good sweeping of leaves and cobwebs. The grout in the women's showers could use a good scrubbing. The halls were perfumed, which was nice. The rooms were clean - the beds (and robes) were comfortable - but I think the tub could be further whitened. Overall, it was a lovely getaway for us. Due to the price, I am not sure we would return unless it was for another special event.Hi Meybe1Day.Thank you for your review on TripAdvisor. We are so glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay at Estancia and will pass your suggestions on to our staff. We hope to see you again soon.
1	Friendly and responsive. We spent two nights (Fri/Sat) at the Kimpton Hotel Allegro while seeing 2 shows in Chicago. Access from O'Hare to the hotel by train was easy, The hotel let us check in early and the room was very nice. They have a 5pm champaign happy hour that we attended both nice and ended up meeting and having great conversations with other guests. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful with recommendations, especially when it rained all day on Saturday and we had already been to the usual museums on previous trips. The only negative was the slow elevators with only 2 of the 3 being operational.Hello! Thank you kindly for taking the time to review our hotel. While we are pleased to see that you had a positive stay overall, we offer our apologies for the poor service of the elevators during you're stay. We are in the process of remodeling our elevators now so that we may better serve our guests. We hope to welcome you back for an improved experience in the future!
1	Nice Hotel. I stayed here with my girlfriend for a week, and ended up spending one of those days in the room completely, due to her falling sick with food poisoning. The hotel was clean, comfortable and had a nice breakfast area. People have complained that it is small (which it is) but breakfast can be taken back to your room, which I preferred. There is a computer/printer available to print out tickets/boarding passes and this was very useful as we needed to print out some tickets to Six Flags in order to take advantage of an online-only deal. We visited the Parkstone Grille restaurant once (on the first night) and found it really nice. It was during a Karaoke night, so it was quite lively and everyone loved my english accent (although I didn't sing!) I wish I'd booked two weeks here as the time flew by so fast, and I already want to go back. I would book here again, although the location is a bit awkward if you plan to visit Baltimore on a daily basis (it's a good 30 minute drive each way) but it was close to Arundel Mill Shopping Mall, and some other amenities (such as the Airport)
0	Blood on the carpet. Walked into this tired hotel and was put off. Once I saw blood on the carpet in my room, room 350, I decided it was time to check out. Disgusting! Fortunately, I had some helpful staff at the front desk that gave me a refund so I could run out of there.
0	Dried vomit on bed skirt. When I brought photos of dried vomit to the front desk they were dismissive. They asked if the sheets were dirty or stained. Need I say more. Sticky stuff on nightstand. Security guards on the floors and security cameras everywhere. Especially as young women, be safe and stay somewhere else.
0	No Hot Water!!!. I stayed at this location in early December. While the room was clean and the location decent, the hotel DID NOT have hot water (staff claimed there was an issue). The staff further didn't take any steps to resolve the issue, it was as though I was a bother to them. I'd accept the behavior if this was a low end hotel, but this is a mid-range Best Western. Guests deserve better.I do apologize that you felt we did not take your complaint seriously. The pump went out on our boiler. We called the repair service and had the pump replaced by the afternoon. I assure you we take all guest complaints seriously and act to rectify the situation. Thank you for reporting your issue.Melissa AlbertGeneral Manager
1	Full of character and in a great location!. Nice little hotel full of character, in a great location - ideal for exploring Fisherman's Wharf.Despite the shared bathroom facilities I never had to queue, however did worry about taking too long in the shower! Room was a bit of a squeeze, with limited privacy as our two windows were internal. Free tea/coffee/chilled water available for free. Two cable car turn-arounds close by so well connected to Downtown and Union square. Ghirardelli Square in walking distance and plenty bars located around about. All in all, good value for money - would recommend for first time visitors to San Francisco!We are very glad to hear that you enjoyed your trip to San Francisco. No matter if this is your first time or you've been here many times, we want our guests to have a good experience.San Francisco is a city that constantly offers new and exciting things to its visitors and inhabitants, but it is expensive, we offer affordable lodging in a magnificent location.Thank you for choosing the San Remo Hotel and staying with us.
1	Mini Vacay. The staff is very friendly and helpful! Rooms and hotel are very clean! The rooftop bar was very nice we really enjoyed the music the view! The rooms are big but it was plenty enough room for my wife and I. Lastly I loved the location! 15 mins away from Bourbon St. and the French Quarters ! Which was wonderful so we didn't have to worry about the loud party crowds!!Thank you so much for taking the time to review your recent mini vacation with us and we are delighted to know you had a great stay. We will commend all of our staff for exceeding your expectations with our service provided. Your business is very important to us and we look forward to always being your hotel of choice whenever you visit our city.Best regards,
1	Philadelphia Favorite. This is my favorite hotel in Philadelphia, and definitely the best value-to-price ratio in town. The service there goes so far beyond expectations that you find yourself continually smiling with surprise (think: Peninsula hotels). From a helpful check-in and even more helpful check-out in a snowstorm, to a stunning room high above the city (try to get into one of the corner rooms on a top floor), everything at the Loews was impeccable. The vibe is stylish and hip but warm and welcoming at the same time. Every Loews Hotel is distinct and this one is very Philadelphian (worlds away from, say, Loews South Beach). The location is ideal for the Convention Center and restaurants in Center City.We are delighted to hear that we are your favorite Philadelphia Hotel! Our team will be happy to hear that you enjoy their friendly, helpful service and the view from your room. We look forward to welcoming you back in the future.Scott N.
1	Sustainable boutique hotel. My husband was here on business, whilst I was here for pleasure. It was a very comfortable stay right in the heart of San Francisco. Easy walking distances to various places of interest, with no steep climb! A big plus here in SF! Enjoyed A feel good stay (environmentally-friendly) as this hotel do practice energy conservation, ie: energy-saving light bulbs, lights activated by inserting card key only, housekeeping really abiding by sign: ''re-using towels, bed-linen. Loved the smell of its cosy bedding. The room with its amenities is very pleasant, tastefully decorated, quiet and offered me a very good sound sleep! I like the spacious bathroom and room lightings (non-glaring).
1	Center of the Middle. This hotel has what it takes to enjoy a Seattle exploration. It is surrounded by every area one must visit within a city that has so many facets to admire. The property has all of the amenities...a Starbucks, a steak house, a deli, a sushi bar, and a great fitness center to work them off. We walked everywhere with ease, and watched the world from a panoramic view from our picture frame window. To say that we were pleasantly surprised would, well, cover it....Thank you for your comments. We love that our central downtown location makes it easy for our guests to explore all that our great city has to offer. It's also great that we can offer all you might need without even leaving the hotel. We would love to have you back with us on your next visit to Seattle.Sarah S.Guest Relations Manager
1	Great place with great staff. We recently stayed at the Best Western and it was wonderful. Our room was spacious with a frig, microwave and coffee maker. The bathroom was nice size and beds very comfortable. We enjoyed the additional amenities of a celing fan which I loved since I have one in every room at home, this was exceptionally nice. We also had a lighted magnified makeup mirror in the bathroom. The hotel had a hot breakfast everyday included and was very close to the streetcar so you could hop on and get just about everywhere. The staff at the hotel was AWESOME - everyone from the manager, the front desk clerks, the housekeepers and breakfast attendant were very friendly and very helpful. I would stay here again in a heartbeat! Thank you all so much. Unfortunately we were there for a tornado, hurricane with some flooding and the power went out around town and at our hotel so we had to move. The place we moved to was horrible but we had no choice since we had to leave the next day,Mary,I hope that you and your daughter enjoyed Jazz Fest and New Orleans despite the weather! We apologize again that the hotel you moved to was not ideal, but unfortunately it was the best option due to the power outage. Thank you so much for your kind words about our staff. If you all become Jazz Fest regulars please keep us in mind for next year!Melissa Albert, General Manager
1	Hotel Diva experience. Overall, a very nice day. I was there on business and needed to be closed to the s s Center. The hotel was under a little bit of construction which was alarming at first but after day two I was very used to it and was not bothered at all. The staff is extremely friendly.Thank you for the kind comments on your recent stay with us. We are pleased to hear our upgrades taking place did not bother you during your visit. We also love to hear our staff are extremely friendly as this is what we strive to offer all of our guests. We hope to have you back again soon.
0	Not worth 10.00. Hair all over place, shower curtain rod broken and couldn't keep closed, water went all over floor, insense sticks sticking out vent and cover burnt, hair dryer didn't work, wrong insert for coffee non usable, room didn't get cleaned at all next day. Staff not knowledgeable at front desk, housekeeping was told to come to room and never showed. Maintenance did show and was ok but not the most interactive. Front desk no apologies given. 1 of our worst stays ever.
1	Just about perfect.. Great location: we wanted to find a hotel that was centrally located enough to not need a car, and the Hyatt House fit the bill. We flew into SeaTac Airport, took the light rail to downtown (Westlake stop) and took the Monorail to Seattle Center (Space Needle, EMP Museum, Chihuly, Key Arena) which is right next the the Hyatt House. Great accommodations: the hotel seems brand new, extremely clean and modern, very spacious. Great staff: everyone was very nice and informative. We got to town about three hours before check-in and they let us check-in early. Great free breakfast: in addition to many choices, there is also a made-to-order omelet bar. Jay cheerfully made the omelets every day and they were excellent. And he would remember my name each day which is pretty amazing:) Other: they have a free shuttle which will take you where you want to go within a certain distance. The gym is not bad, although it is on street level with big windows, so you kinda feel like you are working out in a fish bowl. Great restaurants, coffee shops shopping within walking distance. About the only thing I didn't like was the parking - 25/day (we rented a car a couple days to visit the mountains) but there are cheaper parking lots within a block so it wasn't that big a deal. Check all the travel sites to compare prices - I found one that had the same room for 20 less a night than the rest. Overall the Hyatt House was an excellent choice for our Seattle vacation!Cushionhead,It was a pleasure accommodating you recently at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown and we sincerely appreciate the glowing review! I have shared your feedback with the team regarding your experience and will strive to make sure we are exceeding all of our guests expectations. Please let us know when you visit next as we look forward to having you as our guest!Sarah Junge
0	Cockroaches!. The airline put me here when weather delayed my flight and I missed the connection. The place is not well maintained in general. I will put up with a lot, but when a dozen cockroaches run out of the room when I opened the door, I'm out. This place should be condemned.
0	Not going back anytime soon...... We checked in at 6 pm, 3 hours after check in time of 3pm. Our room wasn't ready and housekeeping staff could be seen standing outside smoking. Granted I was given a 15 discount however, I would have happily paid another 50 per night to not be in that neighborhood. Employees smoking at the door to the lobby, the smell of weed in the hallway, a fight in the parking lot, literally people walking in off the street for the continental breakfast and asking us to use our cell phones, our room was 54 degrees upon entering.... I could go on and on, but won't. Needless to say I would never stay at this hotel or recommend it to anyone. Our friends chose this hotel because it was pet friendly. And they would hang out in our room because theirs reeked. Regardless of how much Lysol of ours they used, it smelled. On a scale of 1-10 it was a 1.
0	Extremly Disappointed. I decided to stay at the Ritz Carlton this past weekend. I've always heard the name, which in my mind indicated luxury( which should luxury service, luxury room, location and so forth). I was extremely disappointed about the way the situation was handled in regards...MoreDear Ms. Eulanda, I am very sorry that you are disappointed with your recent visit. It is common industry practice to ensure that the cardholder has the sufficient funds to cover one night room tax and a discretionary amount to cover potential incidental charges....More
1	Best customer service (entire staff). We have stayed here for two years in a row for the NY marathon. The NY marathon happens to be our wedding anniversary as well. Both years, the Ritz staff have gone above and beyond to celebrate our anniversary and to prep us for the marathon. This year we had our 6 month old daughter and the Ritz went above and beyond for her. There were just too many positive things to list and all these great things involved various staff (bellman, housekeeping, room service, concierge, restaurant staff, spa, gym, etc.). Everyone seems truly happy to work for the Ritz and they constantly were anticipating our needs. We can't wait to come back! The only other hotel that's had this same level of service is The Brando.
1	You asked, so I'll share.... I can't speak to everything as I was not on site. My understanding is that the event went off, without any issues. Having never hosted there before, more information up front would have been helpful, 1) who's our point of contact while we are there, if we have issues, 2) who's handling the catering, 3) who do we contact if the AV isn't working. Thanks for staying with us. I am sorry that some of the key information was not relayed properly. We work hard to make our guests happy and appreciate your feedback. We will be passing this along to our department managers to ensure future events run smoothly!
0	Do NOT stay here. This place needs to be reported to the health department. The check in process was awkward. There are 3 buildings one of which I think people actually live in full time. The smell of mold and mildew is I fathomable We left and ended up going all the way back home.
0	Not clean. Room and bathroom smelled like urine. Breakfast area was dirty, and food was handled with bare hands by attendant instead of using utensils. Overall hotel is severely run down, and in dire need of renovations and updates. At least the sheets were clean and the staff was friendly.
0	The Worst Hotel I have every stayed at.... While this place is relatively inexpensive, it isn't worth the savings! As soon as we walked in, we noticed the room smelled like urine. There was no remote for the tiny television, the towels looked worn and unclean, the mattress was as hard as a rock, there is no ventilation (no ac, no fan) in the room and there are no screens on the windows. The worst part was that we were attacked by mosquitoes all night! The tub didn't drain properly (while I was showering, I was standing in several inches of water) and the bath mat for the outside of the tub was a piece of paper! It is a shame because it is obviously a hotel that has been in SF for a long time, and could be charming if the owners took better care of it. We will never stay here again.
1	Nice Property but Expensive. Stayed at the Courtyard Lake Union for one night on business and I usually dread staying at Courtyards but was pleasantly surprised how well appointed this property was. I believe it has been significantly renovated and they've done a great job!The location is excellent with a lovely view of the lake and walking distance to many restaurants, bars and sights. It takes about 20 minutes to walk to the space needle and about 60 minutes to Pike's Place.However, I've only given this hotel a 4 rating as 430 for one night is crazy for this level of accommodation.Hello kmalho,Thank you for taking your time to share your feedback regarding your recent stay at the Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union hotel. Our hotel did go through quite a few renovations and I am pleased to hear that you liked it. We hope to have another opportunity serve you whenever your travels bring you back to Seattle.Sincerely,Dan PhamGuest Service Representative
1	Wonderful Hotel. Me and my 81 year old mother stayed at Bienville House in April. Everything was fantastic. We stayed in the double double sundeck room which was beautiful, spacious, comfortable and clean - and quiet. Everyone on the staff was friendly but I want to give a huge shout out to Cynthia who works the front desk. She is super friendly and accommodating, helping us with a couple of special requests we made to make our stay more convenient for us. I would highly recommend this hotel and I will stay here again.We are so pleased to hear that your and your grandmother enjoyed your stay at our luxurious hotel. We pride ourselves on our kind and attentive staff, so we will be sure to pass along your lovely comments to Cynthia.
1	Excellent hotel. What a place. Brought the wife for a business trip and she and I both loved it. Great location and the staff treat to your every needs. Excellent in every way. NYC has a lot of offer in hotels this is one of the best. Dear Arubaman2016, On behalf of The St. Regis New York, we thank you for both reviewing the property and allowing us to be a part of your New York City adventures! We do hope you will be back to stay with us soon and ask that you please let us know when you are returning! We would love to have you as our guest in the futureSincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager
1	Sea World Vacation. I had a great experience here. The staff were friendly and gave us different attractions to do that were close by. The room was great. My reservations stated we would have a view but we didn't but that was fine because we didn't have the window open. When we go back to Sea World next year we will book this hotel again. The internet was a little slow but that was okay.It was our pleasure to serve you during your stay at the Ramada Limited San Diego/Near SeaWorld. We apologize for any miscommunication with regards to your room with a view, but we are pleased to know that our helpful staff, comfortable accommodations, and many area attractions made for a wonderful experience during your trip. It's great to hear you will be booking your stay with us next year for your trip back to Sea World. We look forward to seeing you then, and thank you for the five-star review!
1	Great location, charming place. The location is fabulous if you want to be in the French Quarter. Rooms are a little dated, but nice, still quiet even though it's one block off Bourbon street, and the Bombay Club bar/restaurant was great. I would come back and would recommend. I would say this is an epitomy of a New Orleans old charm hotel.Thank you for sharing your feedback regarding your stay! We work hard to meet expectations and were happy that we hit the mark. We hope to have the pleasure of hosting you again during your next visit to New Orleans!
1	Great place close to aiport. I've stayed at this hotel a couple times when flying out early the next morning. You can't go wrong. The rooms are clean and quiet, which is crucial for those early am flights. The customer service is great. The Restaurant and bar service is fantastic. It's nice to grab a sandwich and glass of wine without having to go out. Also, this last stay, the chef was willing to make my special requested sandwich. It was great. Again, service with a smile and you could tell the employees were happy to working at the HGI.Good Day Smalls15,There is no compliment for me and my staff than a guest choosing to stay with us more than one time. It is so nice to hear that your overnight stay with us was enjoyable on every front but most especially that our clean and quiet room made such a good impression with you. This is what we strive to do every day, so I thank you for taking time to acknowledge my teams efforts. We try to be as knowledgeable and helpful as possible to meet every imaginable need a guest may have. Comments like your's let us know we are doing a good job. We hope to see you again at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport and until then wish you safe travels. Sincerely,Alex BlancoGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando International Airport
1	Review of BWestern in Orlando. This hotel was a blessing to our family. The rooms were clean, the beds were comfortable and the breakfast amazing. The staff was kind, and helpful. We would definitely stay here again and my 20 year old didn't want to leave .. he came up talking about how wonderful the breakfast staff was, particularly Amy.. if a 20 year old mentions it .. you know you need to stay at this hotel!Thank you for providing us with your feedback! It's great to hear that you enjoyed your time with us and that our property was perfect for your needs. We're glad that you and your 2o year old loved the breakfast and I will make sure that Amy is aware of your review and recognized at our next meeting. We can't wait to see you again!
1	Booked Here for Our Cruise Because of FREE Parking for 14 Days. Booked the Hilton Garden Inn Miami Airport West at 3550 NW 74th Ave. because it had 14 days of free parking. We booked through the Stay123 website for a one night stay on April 22, 2018. Deposit of 22.60 and a payment of 186.45 at check-in. Not only did we get the free parking, we also got a complimentary one way shuttle to the cruise ship. The cruise port is approximately 8 miles away. The taxi back from the cruise was about 50.00. It was much quicker than waiting for a hotel shuttle which would have been about the same amount.Quickly checked in by Hillary to room 414 in the back - away from traffic. It faced an industrial park. We were close to the Miami airport, but great insulation - as we did not hear any plane noises.No meals were included - a restaurant was available on the premises for food. I have posted photos of menu.Thank you for taking a moment to share your experience. I am happy to hear you found the hotel and staff to your liking. We look forward to welcoming you back to our hotel in the future. Our goal is to make your stay better and brighter. If something isn't just the way you like it, simply let any Team Member know, and we will make it right. Guaranteed.Sincerely,Amanda GrahamFront Office ManagerHilton Garden Inn Miami Airport Westamanda.grahamhilton.com 3056297701
1	A recommendation for the Virginian Suites. My wife and I stayed at the Virginian Suites for 8 days in October. Overall, it was a very enjoyable stay. The only drawbacks were the lumpy pillows and the dripping bathtub (it was in another room, however, and was not a distraction except when one was in the bathroom). We brought it to the attention of the staff as we checked out and they said they would send someone up to look at it. The hotel setting is lovely - just a short walk to a lovely park and the Iwo Jima memorial in Arlington Cemetary. There are two restaurants within a five minute walk of the hotel and leftovers can easily be kept and reheated in the suite's compact kitchen. There is ample parking on the premises for automobiles and the hotel shuttle makes morning and evening runs to the nearest metro station (which is walkable in a pinch) and will take you to the grocery store as well. The suites are large and comfortable and we will probably use them again if we return to Washington.
0	Disgusting. The front of the hotel looks very nice and we were actually pleasantly surprised when we pulled in the driveway--if only our room in the back had been so nice. It looks like they invested all of the renovation money in the front of the hotel, NOT in the back, where there are quite a few rooms. Aside from the room looking dingy and feeling gross, there was a crack between the doorjam and the actual door that you could peek through into the room if you leaned up to the crack--it was wide enough that the brochures the local eateries were sliding into the door went all the way in easily! The broken mini-fridge was actually propped up with the Bible. There was no way I was going to let my kids stay in this motel, we checked out and went to the Days Inn Airport--which was 5 cheaper a night, and although it was no palace, at least we felt safe and had a clean place to stay! I wish that I had just booked a hotel chain I trust from the beginning instead of trying to save a little money--learn from my mistakes!
0	I will not return. Very strong smell in the hallways I was in the last room on the second floor and the internet did not work They offer storage of luggage service but not allowed to leave the luggage after checkout. Extremely rude clerk who answered me in the checkout
1	Excellent Weekend. My wife and I stayed here with a group of friends this past weekend and we could not be happier. The front desk made us feel very welcome, and gave great directions to restaurants and bars. The front desk said they had 3 weddings going on that night so they told us they would put us on a high floor far away from all that noise, this was very much appreciated. Our room was located on the 10th floor and faced west. The room was huge and extremely clean. The bathroom was clean and looked new. The upper floors 10, 11 and 12 are private floors that you need your room key to access, this is a nice feature. I would highly recommend this hotel.Dear Jim T. Thank you very much for taking the time to write about your stay. We are thrilled that you and your wife enjoyed your time with us. We look forward to welcoming you back some time in the future. Wishing you safe travels. Thank you. Dieter Heigl
0	Ancient Internet Infrastructure, Small Rooms, Paper Walls. Do not stay at the hotel Allegro if you value professional courtesy, stable internet connections, or not being subjected to overhearing whatever television show or casual conversation in which the next room is engaged. The beds are small as well. If you're over 6 ft like me, stay somewhere else. Most infuriating of all was my experience with the internet. It was down consistently. It turns out that there was an issue with the router on my floor -- which in and of itself is not a deal breaker. But they asked me to call their tech support staff, which is odd because the guests shouldn't be the ones troubleshooting internet connectivity. I spoke with the technician for around 25 minutes before he figured out the cause. By this point, the meeting that I was supposed to be attending via teleconference was almost halfway over. I marched to the front desk and asked for a new room and was made to feel like a criminal. One of the desk staff actually smirked at me as I described my difficulties. I lost business because I stayed here. Do yourself a favor and don't make the mistake of staying at the Hotel Allegro.Ouch! I'm so sorry to hear that your internet connection was so unstable and that you missed the conference call that you were supposed to attend. As a business traveler, I completely understand the frustration of poor internet. Please reach out to me at rachel.rodriguezallegrochicago.com so we can discuss this matter and come up with a resolution. Rachel RodriguezFront Office Manager
1	Great Stay. I was with four other people on a birding trip to watch the hawk migration. We spotted over 50 species of birds as we traveled across the keys. The hotel is new. The room was spacious and I loved the shower, microwave, and mini frig. The breakfast was wonderful and allowed us to make an early start for our birding. I commend Rosemary Johnson, an employee, that assisted me in finding ice, entering the pool area, and making me feel welcome even though it was late at night. Thank you for a lovely experience.Thank you for your comments. So glad you had a great stay. Rosemary is one of many of our amazing team members here to assist our guests. Thank you for staying with us. Hope you come back again to explore more of this wonderful bird sanctuary habitat.
1	Stadthotel. Das Mill's House Hotel ist fr mich ein typisches durchschnittliches Stadthotel. Das Zimmer war eher klein aber mit guten Betten. Die Einrichtung war hbsch, ausreichend und sauber. Da das Zimmer zum Innenhof lag war es sehr ruhig; der Pool war geschlossen, obwohl es zum Baden noch warm genug gewesen wre.Das Restaurant hatte die Grsse einer Bahnhofshalle und hat uns nicht zum Bleiben 'verfhrt'. Gerade nebenan gab es ein wundervolles Restaurant mit guter Bedienung und gutem Essen.Die Bar bzw. die Lobby und auch der Innenhof mit seinem Brunnen sieht gemtlich und einladend aus.Das Hotel liegt ideal fr alle Sehenswrdigkeiten in Fussgnger-Nhe. Empfehlenswert ist der Gang ber die Kingsstreet mit seinen vielfltigen Lden und der Besuch der Villengegend im French-Quarter. Nicht besuchenswert ist der 'Market' - eine reine Touristenfalle.Wer nur kurz in Charleston verweilt, kann dieses Hotel als Ausgangsstation buchen - ich kann es empfehlen.Nebenbei: Savannah ist hnlich wie Charleston aber lebendiger und vielfltiger. Ich wrde vermutlich eher in Savannah ein Hotel suchen und lnger bleiben, und Charleston nur im Vorbeifahren besichtigen.
0	Does not live up to its reputation. We recently stayed at this hotel on a trip to Lexington with other friends. Our group shared the feeling that we would not be back. We routinely waited more than 10 minutes for elevators. The workout room is tiny with 2 treadmills and 2 cheap elliptical machines that rocked off the floor when in use. Everything about the hotel seemed... More
1	Great Value. We evacuated to this hotel ahead of Hurrican Irma from Florida. The staff couldn't have been nicer or friendlier. Decor not much, but decent size room. The 4-star rating is for the staff and extra's. They have nice amenities--indoor/outdoor pool, small fitness room, but very nice and accommodating hot breakfast (free) AND free Happy Hour with 3 drinks each AND hot and cold appetizer buffet, which was enough to eat as dinner. There was nice green, tossed ( fresh) salad, soup, chili, hot dog bar, nacho bar, Italian pasta, chicken fingers, cheese, fruit, and one to two other items I do not remember. What I ate was good--did not try chicken fingers. Thought it was a nice extra for what you would normally pay for a hotel.
0	Danger!. On the first day, management was informed that the ground floor stairwell doors at both ends of the building were not secure the bottom of the doors scraped on the outside pavement and the doors could not reach the secure position, even with force. Management indicated it was aware of the situation new door/frame sets were on order. When I... More
1	Comfort and convenience. My stay was uneventful and quiet which is exactly what is needed for business travel. A light outside my room was flickering badly but was repaired the same evening upon calling the front desk. Breakfast and to go snacks were also convenient.Thank you very much for giving us feedback regarding your recent stay with us at the Best Western East Inn Suites. We wanted to thank you for staying with during your business trip, and we do apologize for the flickering light. However, we are glad to know that our front desk staff and maintenance were able to take care of the issue quickly. We are glad that you enjoyed your stay, and we do to see you again soon!
1	would return. great location right off of duval street. our room however was extremely small, smaller than a cruise ship, but very nice all the same. staff was friendly, breakfast was enough to get you going. pool area was beautiful. the only problem we had was that our room keys did not work properly. got one of them fixed which was good because after 11:00 at night no one is at the front desk to let you in lobby or hotel, a key is needed so double check you keys to outside entrances. would definitely return.As you found out, there is not a lot of space in Key West and yes some of the rooms are cozy. We appreciate the review and look forward to your return.
0	Great location - unprofessional management and counter staff. Have stayed here before as we keep a sailboat accros the street at a marina. We live in Denver. Arrived expecting a bay view room non-smoking (yes, this property still allows smoking!). The door key would not work and had to ask three times at the counter for help. When we did get in, room was a smoking room! Counter manager said I should have booked directly with the property and not through the BW website!. Ended up in a room with two double beds on another floor. The front desk staff is not friendly and the manager looks like he just got out of bed! Moving to the Holiday Inn next door on our next trip.Good afternoon,We cater to all guest and there's still guest that smoke, so we need to take care of them also. Sorry you feel staff was not friendly I will have a conversation with that crew and see exactly what transpired. We try our best to provide the best service possible to all guest that walk in to our property, sometimes we do it right some time we don't. But we always give 100 in resolving the issues we encounter daily.Regards,Jorge A. Mendoza Jr. General ManagerBest Western Yacht Harbor Hotel
1	Nice Place to Stay. This hotel was a bit older but very well maintained. The room was spacious with a separate full kitchen and a walk-in closet. There was zero noise from elevators or guests above or next door, unlike many newer hotels we've stayed in. Our only complaint was that the place was a bit difficult to find after dark - the sign is not high enough to be easily visible. In daylight, we discovered it was extremely easy to travel right next door to the Arlington Cemetary or across the Arlington Bridge to the Lincoln Memorial, Washington Monument, etc. The price was very reasonable and we would definitely stay here again.
1	Difficult to rate. Ok, their computers were down when I checked in. The wait to check in was too long AND the person behind the desk allowed another guest to deliberately cut in front of me and when questioned I was given an explanation of 'I don't know'. Then when I checked in, I was given the wrong room because someone was already in it. When I went back to lobby, there was another long wait because apparently other guests were given the wrong room also. Also, the card I checked in with for incidentals was charged for the stay, even though, I've already paid through hotels.com. I am aware that circumstances arise that are sometimes out of their control and I believe the the situation was handled to the best of their ability. I was given free items from the lobby fridge for the rude guests that cut in front of me AND my room was upgraded for free because I was initially given the wrong room. Lastly, I was completely reimbursed for them charging twice on my card. The situations were handled efficiently and the staff was accommodating to my concerns, questions and needs.
0	Great location - but really more like a hostel than a hotel. On entry, the lobby was quite tired: old carpet, paint chipping, etc. Hallways and room had a old, dusty odor, but the window did open, so we could get fresh air. Everything in the bedroom was old (not quite historic), with rusty fixtures in the bathtub. We were on the fourth floor, so it took a long time on our first morning to get steady hot water, and then later that afternoon - no hot water at all. There is no excuse for a lack of hot water at a hotel in the Second City.The price should have given me a clue. I read the reviews here before booking and lent more credence to those that saw it as 'quaint', but in reality it's just bad. I need to be renovated top to bottom.Staff were nice enough, and maybe in the 'home country' this hotel might have been acceptable, but not here, not in Chicago, not in any major US city.Would have been much better to spend the extra 200 and stay at the Willows one block away.We apologize about the issues you had while staying at our hotel. We are not sure why you had issues with the hot water. We had not received any complaints so it may have been isolated to your room only. We are in the process of finalizing our new hotel that will be built on the current site to give our guests an updated space with many more amenities. We are not sure what the meaning of home country is but we are an american owned and operated hotel. We are an economy hotel that can offer clean, quiet rooms at a discounted rate for the traveler coming to the Chicago area. Thank you again for your comments. Paul Schoonover - General Manager
1	Luxurious high-rise in SOMA district. Spent two days here prior to a conference that was being held at nearby Moscone Center.Took BART from Airport to this hotel - very easy and fast. Hotel is about 5 minute walk from the Montgomery Street station. Arrived at Noon - room was not yet ready. Front Desk attendant took my phone number and said they would call when room become available - but they never called. Not a big problem - I went out and enjoyed the sights. Came back around 3:30 and was then able to check-into my room. Was given a north-facing room on the top floor (top floor of hotel, that is - the upper floors of the building are for the St. Regis Residences). Room decor was very serene and calming. Never heard anything from outside or other quests while I was here! Bathroom was especially nice, with lots of room, wonderful amenities, rainforest shower and separate soaking tub. Everything in the room seemed fine, except for my master-control panel - some of the features just wouldn't work (phone, radio control, etc.) - I never called for assistance, just got by with using the other phone (think there were four phones total in the room). Bed and linens were OMG spectacular. Slept like a baby and felt wonderful when I woke up!Took any early morning swim in the pool - very nice - and it was great that the pool is open 24/7. Fitness center was well-equipped, and super clean.Ate Breakfast at the hotel restaurant - which was lovely, but quite expensive. Lobby bar and main restaurant looked lovely, but I didn't have a chance to experience them. Visited the Museum of African Diaspora which is accessible from first floor of the hotel - very nice place. The hotel has a great location for visiting the fine arts museums - many within a block or two - Yerba Beuna Gardens, Jewish Heritage, Museum of Modern Art. Also just a couple blocks from the high-end shopping of Union Square.If you are seeking a space of serene luxury in the heart of the SF hustle and bustle, the St Regis definitely delivers.
0	Motel turned hotel. Walked in to the room and was greeted by an overpowering stench of disinfectant. We opened all the windows but it took several days for the smell to disappear. Ceilings are extremely thin and so you hear anyone walking around upstairs well into the late hours of the night. Every morning, we found broken glass in the parking lot, probably from a late night patron of the breakfast joint next door. For 240 bucks per night, I would have expected far less problems. I shared these issues with the front desk and they said they would put us in an upstairs room on our next visit. This is obviously an old motel turned into a Best Western. We won't be back.Thank you for completing the survey regarding your recent stay at our property. On behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you gave us to implement improvements to ensure we offer a better experience for guests in the future. We have always been a Best Western and have just gone through a 100 remodel of our property I hope that you will consider staying with us again so that we can have another chance to provide you with a superior experience.
1	I felt comfortable here!. This place is older and probably could benefit from some updating, however I felt very comfortable here. I stayed a week for business but I have friends and family in Texas so I had a really nice visit as well. My parents stayed with me the first couple of nights and they enjoyed the bed while I slept on the couch which was not uncomfortable. My parents relaxed and enjoyed the room while I was at work and when I returned in the evening we would go have a nice dinner at nearby restaurants. The kitchen area was nice for making coffee in the morning and the refrigerator came in handy for breakfast items in the morning or leftovers from dinner the night before. I didn't feel well the 3rd day I was there and my parents had already left. I didn't want to go out for dinner so I headed down to check out the happy hour. They had wine and snacks and light meal options which was great! I chose some soup and crackers and went back to bed and felt better by morning. I liked the pool area but didn't get a chance to enjoy it. The gift shop had sandwiches and other drinks and snacks, my sandwich was very dry and I didn't like it that much but I'm sure a different choice would have made a difference. The parking is very old school with a big heavy gate on large springs that raise to allow you into the covered multilevel parking, which they do charge you for. Overall I liked this hotel. The room was nice, the bed and pillows were comfy, nice desk area for nightly paperwork, the toothpaste they provided came in handy since I ran out and the food and beverage was a nice treat!
0	Low Point of our AWESOME Orlando Vacation. Stay somewhere else.. Location, location, location. This is the main reason this hotel stays in business. We had the best vacation in our 8 days in Orlando, and the hotel room was the only thing that did not work out for us. The price was low, and we got what we paid for.We were recommended this hotel by a travel agent based in Orlando, who told us that the Days Inn we were looking at was disgusting. We did not expect the Ritz, but the photos on the hotel website are at least 15 years old and taken from the best possible angles. It is in a great location, it took us 21 minutes to walk to Universal, and it is a beautiful walk with wide sidewalks the whole way.At check in we were assigned room 211. When we entered, the carpets had wet spots, and smelled like urine. The front desk immediately gave us a key for a room on the third floor. This room did not smell, and we did stay in it. It was not clean enough for our standards, so we purchased cleaner and paper towels and spent an hour cleaning the bathroom and vanity ourselves. Toilet ran- had to giggle the handle every time to stop water flow. Shower was moldy, pipes were loud, and pressure/temperature would vary greatly during your shower.The bed sheets are too small for the bed, and completely threadbare. At least they seemed clean. The bath towels were rough and the size of large hand towels. We had 5 people in the room, but most days got only 3 towels and had to ask for more at the front desk. Rugs were nasty- we kept on our shoes in the room. Only one door key was assigned, and the plastic key would get stuck in the lock every time.On the positive side, the kids loved the pool, and it was cleaned daily. The pool area is a bit old, and the chairs are cheap, but the pool bar is adequate and serves decent food. You can use your laptop near the pool. Pool towels are available at the front desk if you ask for them- but they do not let anyone know this, and most of the other families were using their bath towels.Breakfast was spartan, none of the fruit or muffins they show on the website. Bread for toast, milk, OJ, and frosted flakes were the only options for the kids. Coffee was TERRIBLE. There is an IHOP within a block and about 20 breakfast buffets within 1 mile- use them if you want a good breakfast.From this location you can walk to so many restaurants, and can catch a bus to anywhere in Orlando. Try eating O'Charleys on Turkey Lake Road (1 mile away). They had great food and prices. Lots of great spots for ice cream nearby.Our family is planning to return to Orlando in 2011 and have found much, much nicer properties for only a slightly higher cost. Look at the trip advisor ratings and try to find a higher rated hotel. It's worth the extra cost, especially with the low rates that hotels charge in Orlando.Good luck, and enjoy your time in this spectacular city!
1	A Gem on the Quarter's Edge. My husband and I recently stayed at the Bienville House Hotel. It is located just on the French Quarter's edge which I really liked, because you are not right in all the crowds and craziness, but you are easy walking distance to the action. The hotel is kept up very nicely and I especially appreciated the free continental breakfast as well as the lemonade and cookies in the late afternoon. The courtyard pool was a great place to relax during the hot afternoons and was never crowded. We also enjoyed the fine dining at Iris restaurant and their amazing bartender's unique cocktail concoctions! We found the staff to be very friendly and accommodating and appreciated being allowed to check our bags after we had to check out, but with time to sight-see before catching our plane. I thought the value for all of the amenities was really great! After researching a large number of NOLA hotels and BB's I strongly feel that Bienville offers a reasonable price and strong value for their great location, rooms, and services. Would 100 recommend for a vacation in NOLA!!
0	Keep an eye on your possessions, cleaning staff steals !. Our family stayed there for one evening in March and were not impressed. The hotel is newly renovated, however the building is quite old. You can hear people walking, talking, running. If you have kids staying above your suite, good luck on getting any sleep. While having breakfast, in the morning, the fire alarm went off, and it was very loud and went off for quite some time, possibly 10 min, we were all looking at each other, thinking what to do, while the staff was walking around casually, there was no direction, evacuation procedure, zero communication. Finally, we asked one of the servers if he knew what was happening, he explained that they will be here soon to fix it. That was it. After we checked out, my wife realized that she had left her gold bracelet on the night table. We phoned the hotel and returned only to find nothing and that the staff no e speak English. Only the cleaning staff has access to a securely card-lock controlled room. We are told basically too bad, so sad. We wrote letter and called the hotel and head office. The same response, sorry, could not find it Basically, the gold bracelet walked out of the room on its own. Very dissatisfied and unhappy. Very unresponsive management. Will not stay there, nor will we recommend it. We paid to stay at a hotel and get robbed.Dear Valued Guest,We appreciate your candid response. I apologize on behalf of Four Points by Sheraton that your stay was not as expected.Yes we are a fully renovated new hotel in Seattle, and I apologize for the fire alarm. When this happened we were instructed by the Fire Department to wait until they arrived to silence it.Regarding your gold bracelet, as we discussed earlier, we did do a thorough investigation looking for this and questioned our staff. The Housekeeper that cleaned your room is a trusted and valued employee. It is unfortunate the bracelet was missing, but were not able to locate it anywhere.I apologize for these situations again. By far, most guest experiences here are excellent and guests are pleased. If we are able to have you back please contact me so that I can personally make sure we take care of your stay.Thank you,Joe AlbertsGeneral Manager
0	Definition: You get what you pay for.. Hotel is located about a 10-15 minute drive from downtown Nashville. Employees all were very nice. They are currently renovating and have construction going on. Did not have water (at all, no hot or cold, nothing) so not being able to take a shower after work is just unacceptable. Water was off for a few hours. Room was clean, but... More
1	Probably the best location to visit the main sights. We chose this hotel because of the location and we weren't disappointed. Right opposite the music museum, science museum and space needle. Happy Hour at the bar offered a good selection of local beers and wines. The rooms weren't huge but comfortable and clean. The breakfast was buffet style and a little bit busy with everybody having to convene in a small corridor area where the buffet is served but lots to choose from. Omelettes can be made to order. Convenient to walk the short mile to Pike Place and also to savour many of the great restaurants in the neighbourhood. One negative comment is that there are only 2 elevators for the entire hotel, so you could be waiting quite a while for the elevator to come to your floor if it was first thing in the morning and everybody was heading to breakfast. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to guests.Thanks so much for taking the time to leave this review! We are so pleased to hear that you got to experience the neighborhood attractions. We are totally biased, but we think it's pretty great as well! We feel privileged to have had you as our guest - we hope it won't be the last time. Safe travels to you wherever you go - thanks again!

1	Nice central hotel. Stayed two nights, was greeted by Ben who was very helpful throughout our meetings during our stay, nicest hotel staff we had on our 2 week trip. The room has been refurbished but it's lacking coffee in the room, it's available by the front desk though. Nothing against the hotel (it's next to a Hilton who would have the same issue) but there are a lot of homeless in the area although they generally didn't cause much issue. It was noted the expensive hotels seem to have walkways above the pavements to avoid the riffraff, although I didn't really like the idea of rising above everyone else to be honest. Only a 5 min walk to Marta stations and downtown areas, 10 mins to the Olympic park area.
1	Lovely hotel, but.... This is a lovely hotel where one is made to feel very welcome. An extra bonus (for cat lovers, at least) is Claire, the resident cat. The hotel is ideally located for exploring the utterly charming French Quarter. Our room was beautiful and very comfortable but as this is an old building, it is not very soundproof and other guests talking in the courtyard and entryway and wheeling their luggage around disturbed us early each morning - at 4am during the first night. The Frette linens and Molton Brown toiletries were much appreciated luxury touches. We were however disappointed by the breakfast - we ordered toast in preference to biscuits and one slice of toast each seemed rather meagre. Be warned - the coffee is flavoured with chicory - a New Orleans tradition but not to our taste. I would recommend this as a place to stay if you are happy to put up with the quirks of an old building but suggest eating breakfast elsewhere.We usually do have pure coffee in the freezer. We don't get many requests but we try to stay prepared. You simply needed to request it. I doubt that anyone could find breakfast spots in New Orleans that serve pure coffee. New Orleans traditional caf au lait is French roasted chicory coffee served with an equal part of warm milk. That is what we serve. That is what Caf du Monde serves. We are famous for our buttermilk biscuits but we do keep gluten free and whole grain bread for the guests who don't eat white flour. I do apologize that you were served only two slices of toast. An order of biscuits if four therefore an order of toast should also be at least four.Please if your travels bring you back to New Orleans give us another try. In addition to the tea , hot chocolate and iced coffee that are always available we will brew pure for you each morning. We will also give you a room on the second or third floor or even on the other side of the street so if we have late arrivals or early departures you won't be disturbed.Claire would be disappointed if you went elsewhere and so would I

1	New San Francisco Favorite. It's unfortunate that I only stayed one night because this is a wonderful hotel. The room was so tranquil with neutral colors and simple yet elegant and comfortable furnishings. The bathroom is well appointed with a large vanity area and a deep soaking tub which fills quickly. It is open to the bedroom but with a panel that can be closed for privacy. The bed is so comfortable with the softest sheets. The staff is friendly and helpful. Having checked in somewhat late and being a Starwood member (which was acknowledged at check-in) a request for a (brief) late checkout was honored without any problem. I have found that in general bring polite and reasonable helps a great deal with requests like these. My rate included breakfast which was fresh and plentiful. The service at Vitrine was friendly and quick. I was not there long enough to try the spa, pool or fitness facilities but the look great and I hope to go back for a longer stay and try them. My only complaint about the hotel is the cost to park. The valets are quick and friendly but that doesn't entirely justify over 50 to park for overnight. Also, and this is just a general gripe, I encountered a few spoiled and rude fellow guests who seemed to think that paying a premium for a hotel room entitles them to slam doors and be generally disruptive in public areas. It's just a general wish that people would be polite and act appropriately. I won't blather on about staying on some of the world's best hotels, blah, blah, blah. However the St. Regis San Francisco in my opinion ranks with those in terms of location, service, amenities and comfort.
1	A hidden Gem in San Diego. I read all the ratings before I booked the Best Western Mission Bay. Couldn't believe it could be as good as I was reading for the price I was given. Well it is everything and more. It is a 3 floor hotel with elevator and easy to climb stairs. The room was just beautiful, as nice as a 5 star hotel I had previously stayed in. They offer a free breakfast with juic3, coffee, eggs, bacon, waffles, donuts, toast, danish and more. I couldn't believe how much when I walked in. The room was a bit small but people were nice with making room. This hotel is so close to Old Town and Sea World you never need to get back on the freeway unless you chooose to. I went up to Mission Bay and followed that into Old Town. Rooms are a great size also and lots of parking available. Its a fantastic hotel to choose and I will stay here on my next San Diego visit. The staff was the friendliest people I have ever met. The man who checked me in made sure I was happy and under stood everything. Pool has a code and he explainex that and it opened very easily. Nice pool abd nice spa. I liked that when I checked in the gentleman wrote the pool code and breakfast hours on the paper that held the room key. Very very professional and friendly. I didnt want to go home. Great Hotel. Thank You Best Western Mission Bay for making my two days the best ever.Good Afternoon,I am trilled to know you had a fantastic stay with us here at the Best Western Mission Bay. I'm glad that you enjoyed your stay and were happy with our staff, service and our Hot Continental Breakfast. Here at the Best Western Mission Bay we work hard to deliver a great service and clean rooms, and Im glad we were able to provide that for you.If you ever return to San Diego, youre welcome to contact me directly at 619-275-5700 ext 393 or Lpradohotelpros.biz for your reservation needs.Sincerely,Leidy PradoFront Office Manager
1	Good value. We stayed here for three nights while visiting Disneyland. We had two rooms, one standard (for the in-laws) and one suite. We booked the suite in order to have a separate sleeping room for the kids. The extra room, however, was very small (just enough room to unfold the bed) and couldn't be used for much more than sleeping (it had no TV). Strangely, the extra room also lacked any heat (it only had a cooling unit). We were in Anaheim during a cold spell in January so this was problematic but didn't ruin our stay.The standard room seemed a bit more updated than the suite but, aside from some peeling paint, both rooms were clean and comfortable. The hot breakfast was perfect (selection included belgian waffles, eggs, sausages, toast, pastries, cold cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit) but, as has been noted by other reviews, the seating area is woefully inadequate. Fortuntately, we weren't there during a busy time so the lack of room was more of a nuisance than anything else.I estimated the walk to Disneyland front gates to be about a mile. For us, it took 15 to 20 minutes, which was what we expected.Service was friendly and attentive. All in, given the price, we thought the value was excellent and would stay here again.Thank you for sharing your thoughts on your recent stay with us. I am checking into the issue you had with no heat in the suites extra room. I am also having the bathrooms repainted as we speak. I will speak to our staff again about reporting any issues about the rooms to me. Thank you for bringing these issues to my attention. I assure you that they will be fixed by your next visit.

A huge thank you for sorting out the issues and for the recommendations. Had coffee and snack before leaving the hotel enjoyable. Valet parking.KennethSmith - Thank you for your review and for recognizing our Housekeeping Manager for his efforts.

1	Great hotel for business stay!. Spent 4 nights here on a business trip. Rooms are comfortable and spacious. Service was great and had very little to complain about. Location of hotel is very convenient if you need to be in that area. A bit far out if you want to travel to downtown and airport...shops and restaurants however are close by so all in all if you on business and not pleasure then being far from downtown is not too big a problem.Thank you for the feedback on your recent trip, I am pleased you enjoyed yourself and hope to see you back soon!
0	Chelseas dirty little secret. Let me start with the positives. Its located next to the Tropicana. Now the negatives. It started with the 1920's elevator. You only need to ride it once to prefer climbing the stairs. It shimmies and sways for the whole ride. The stairwell and halls are dark. Thank goodness for the pink neon lights. The room was small but it was relatively clean. No stains on the beds or towels like other people found. They call this the social end of the hotel. First, its a motel and second, social means.. people that pay for rooms by the hour. Normally when you check out of a hotel, the desk clerk asks how your stay was... I guess they don't ask questions they don't want to answer to. If we had only paid 60 or less for the room I wouldn't be complaining. We got a living social deal and it was too much for this room. So if you can get this room for less than 60 then its worth it if for nothing else but the location. Word to the wise, take the stairs, dont bring a black light and sleep with one eye open.
0	Looks nice but it's in the hood. Had issues with checkin in everyone was backed up there is two seperate hotels across a busy street from one another . Tbe hotel is in the hood .

The Vagabond is now allowing children of all ages!!! if you plan on bringing your kids, ask for one of the four corner rooms which have two double beds, (since everything else is king size beds)... otherwise you children have to sleep on one king bed..bring snacks, food and water for kids (no kids menu)... the rooms are spacious enough, just not too many drawers space (only three). full closet, blow dryer, ironing board, etc. for under 200 bucks a night, you can't beat this place!! the food is fantastic. I recommend renting a car and doing little day trips, but no matter what, there's nothing like the Vagabond pool vibe. I could live here!!SO gald you enjoyed your stay with us and we hope to see you back at the Vagabond soon. We changed our policy of no children under 13 earlier this year and we have more families now staying with us and enjoying the pool and the floaties !
1	Hurricane was no match for this hotel. I stayed at this hotel due to Hurricane Irma(9+ days). I needed to evacuate due to work and the whole team at JW Marriott Buckhead was great. We were not the typically execs that would stay, we were under 30 with kids, but the staff never treated us different and had most respect for us. Just the team treating us with the respect no matter who we were or what we wore was the most uplifting feeling ever. Yolanda at the hotel bar/restaurant was so professional and accommodating. Please make sure she knows her efforts were noted and so very appreciated. Every morning we have breakfast as the Nox lounge, with the same server, I should know his name but i do not. What a fantastic gentleman. He knew the coffee, tea and double kids breakfast cereal. I would never think twice of staying here.Natalie V from Florida - thank you for your nice post. I am so very sorry that you had to evacuate for Irma and trust that you have been able to return to your home with your family. We are always here for you and enjoy taking care of our guests no matter if they are business travelers or families. Taking care of our guests is what we do best. I will be share to share your nice compliments with Yolanda. Thanks for sharing.
1	Staff is interested in getting to know their guests.. The staff at the Orchard Garden Hotel is very interested in getting to know their guests. Finding out where they have traveled and why they are visiting San Francisco. The staff does make a lot of suggestions for sites and things to do, all very welcomed. I did wish the hotel provided free bottle water in the room. Breakfast was reasonably priced for being in a big city, the staff is very attentive.I'm thrilled that you found our staff so helpful and welcoming, Batrik -- that's exactly as it should be! As for the bottled water, we believe that providing these would go against our green initiative goals. That being said, I'm so pleased that the rest of your stay was enjoyable! Safe travels home, and we look forward to welcoming you back to San Francisco.Best,Collins C., Front Office Manager
0	BED BUGS. So this hotel is pretty nice to look at, and the staff was very friendly, however, we entered the room (very small) and continued to look at the room. We lifted up the sheets and it was clean and mattress was clean, however in the box spring of the bed, there was a swarm of bed bugs that once we flashed the light on them they all dove into the box spring. We continued and the front desk and they upgraded our room, however due to our disgust we arranged a booking at the Hyatt Regency down the road which was beyond clean. Thank you Front desk for your efforts to accommodate, but we could not deal with the bed bugs in your hotel.Guest feedback is important to us and we take any comment regarding bedbugs seriously. We have a proactive pest elimination policy that includes regularly scheduled inspections by a professional pest control company. Additionally we have thoroughly trained all of our housekeeping associates to inspect our guest rooms for any signs of pest activity. If necessary, our pest control company conducts bed bug elimination procedures using the latest in pesticide technology.I encourage anyone with questions or comments regarding our pest control policy to contact me directly at 312.777.0805 .

0	We got sent away even though we had a reservation. We arrived and immediately got told we were at the wrong hotel. I pulled out my confirmation proving that we were not. The gentleman went in the backroom and, after much cursing, yelling, and get them out of my hotel we were told they were full and couldn't let us stay there. We felt genuinely concerned and left even though... More
0	Expected More. Nice property and rooms but the service was awful. Hard to get attention from front desk. Multiple requests needed to get issues resolved. It's a big hotel but doesn't have the customer service needed.
0	OMG!!!. I can't even begin to review this hotel. This hotel is SOOOOO dated.The elevator has a gate and a door and it doesn't stay open. Try getting your luggage in the elevator, keeping the door and gate open so that you can get in without it slamming shut on you. I just can't believe that they didn't at least try to fix it so that it stays open so that you can get in with luggage into elevator.I have to say it was a struggle to get in. NOT FUN!! The room was clean but very tight. I had a full bed and my luggage was on the other half of the bed. No room to put luggage anywhere but on the bed. Good thing I was on my own. Sink was in the bedroom. We are sorry that overall, you did not love your stay with us. We are pleased to provide clean, comfortable accommodation at a very competitive rate in San Francisco, which is notoriously expensive, and we are sorry that we and our property were unable to meet your expectations. Thank you for choosing to stay here on this occasion. Best wishes, Hotel Management
1	Convenience vs. Quality. We stayed at the Comfort Inn at Turner Field because of the convenience and closeness to Turner Field while seeing a Braves Baseball game. Unfortunately, their remodeling of the front desk area and breakfast area made getting in and out miserable. The front desk personnel were great, the room was ok (there was hair on the bathroom floor and the windows were permanently fogged so we couldn't see Turner Field from our room, and we were able to walk to the field. We just wish they had scheduled their remodeling during non-baseball season. I mean, that's their calling card and they should play it up.Thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey regarding your recent stay at our hotel.Your feedback is very important to us and we can assure you that we will use this information to do everything possible to create an enjoyable experience for each of our guests. We hope to see you again soon!Sincerely,Joya GregoryGeneral ManagerComfort Inn Turner Field Atlanta, GA404-658-1610
0	Aweful. Made reservation here based on reviews, so writing a real review. Stayed in room 204 with family of 4 for one night. The good, no bugs. The bad, smelled of mold/mildew, water stains on ceiling, stained bathroom towel, greasy tv remote, dirty tub, old tatered carpet overall dirty run down feel. The mattersses where in good shape.

1	Great location, helpful staff, good value. My wife, brother-in-law and I spent four nights in a two-room family suite on the second floor, looking over Columbus Avenue, with views of Coit Tower and Alcatraz. It was very quiet in the motel: we couldn't hear people in the next room, although there was some noise from the street. Rates were low for SF - we paid 135/night for a two-room suite. Our rooms were clean, spacious, smoke free, and looked recently decorated with new carpets. The furniture was solid and the beds were comfortable. The motel is centrally located - an easy walk from Fisherman's Wharf and North Beach, both with plenty of shops and restaurants. It was one block from the Powell-Mason Street cable car terminus and bus number 30 stopped right outside the motel. We bought the 3-day MUNI pass, and went everywhere by cable car, streetcar and bus. The front desk staff were helpful, helped us to find places to eat, gave directions, and booked the shuttle bus to the airport. We had breakfast each day at Pat's Cafe, 2 minutes walk away, and can highly recommend it.
0	Not a Hotel or Resort. I'll start this review by saying that Honua Kai is not a Hotel or a Resort. It's amazing that they charge a 25.00 resort fee, because this place is merely a Condominium Complex. I've read the numerous other reviews on this place, and most of them are spot on. The rooms are nice, because they are new, but everything else... More
0	Poor Customer Service Practices. We were invited to the wedding of a close family member in San Diego with only 3 weeks notice. A friend got us two rooms at Rodeway Inn Qualcomm at a discounted rate to help us with travel expenses. We received our confirmations 15 days prior to check in.On the very morning we left for San Diego, we received a phone call from the manager of Rodeway Inn Qualcomm telling us we were not eligible for the discounted rooms, and our reservations had been cancelled. There was no offer to keep the reservations at the standard rate the reservations had simply been cancelled and the rooms were no longer available. When asked why he would do this on the day we were due to check in, the manager basically told us he did it because he could.We understand that hotel policies may limit the availability of discounted rooms, but we should have been notified earlier so we could make other arrangements. We set off to San Diego with no accommodations. This was certainly the worst customer service we've ever experienced at any lodging establishment.
0	No assistance provided. We stayed at this hotel during a huge cheerleading competition. When we got back into our room after a day of being done for 12 hours we found our room had not been made. I attempted to call the front desk several times but no one had answered. I sent my daughter down to ask for towels since our room was not made. My daughter then called me and said they have no towels. I told her to go back to the front desk and put me on the phone since their phones are still busy. The front desk told me that they don't make up the rooms on the weekends, which is not what was advertised on the tent card in my room, and that the hotel was completely out of towels. I told her I have 4 people in here that need to shower when will towels be available. She stated at 9 the next day when housekeep is in. I told her we need to shower then she FINALLY offered hand towels. Needless to say I have never been to a hotel where they don't clean my room and ran out of towels!! I will never ever stay here again!
0	Location great, everything else poor. Situated right on the Chinatown gates, Astoria is perfectly located. A few blocks from the muni the cable cars, bart within 1 block but the hotel itself is terrible but it's very cheap. The whole place needs a refurb something doing about the smell which lingered in the corridor room.I found the bed comfy but won't be in a rush to go back. We were also lucky to receive complimentary pubes in the bathroom on arrival.
0	PLEASE,AVOID THIS PLACE. Horrible smelly roomsasked for our money back ,since we could not have stayed in this place with my daughter having difficulties breathing in that smell.They told us they will refund-well,the money was never returned to my account.Even when asked a several times.Rude staff.
1	Clean and friendly. The most important thing to us is the cleanliness of the hotel, and especially the room. We did not worry about anything as it was fresh and clean every day. The staff was all friendly at all times of the day. We arrived earlier than our check in time but our room was ready so that was good too.Thank you Dolores for taking the time to review our hotel. Our housekeeping staff takes pride in the cleanliness of each room. We are delighted to see that we've exceeded your expectations that our staff had an opportunity to make a great connection with you! We hope that we'll be your first choice the next time you visit San Diego!!!
1	Excellent Hotel!. My husband and I stayed here for three nights last weekend and loved it from the moment we walked into the lobby. We arrived prior to check in time and we were told our room would be ready in about an hour. The front desk staff was so friendly and helpful and offered to store our bags while we went to lunch. They gave us several recommendations for restaurants nearby. The hotel is very elegant and so immaculate! Location is wonderful...close to the french quarter but in a quiet, safe area. The breakfast buffet was great and the evening happy hour and buffet was excellent too and a great added bonus. You can't beat the value of this hotel.
0	Not impressed. Close to airport but also close to a noisy road. Each day a car alarm went off at least once in parking area next door, plenty of traffic noise. I thought our patio door was cracked or broken letting in so much noise. I looked into changing hotels within hours of arriving. There is nothing extra about this hotel: soda machine outside in parking area. Room was very small. The two of us had a hard time with having a spot to keep suitcase. Not sure what a larger party would do with the space. Fridge and Microwave in room were nice. Breakfast room was small and always crowded but the food was good. My son loved the waffles. We have a beautiful view of the Holiday Inn next door. Not impressed.Dear Beachbum 2330,Thank you for your comments concerning your stay at the Best Western Yacht Harbor Hotel. I appreciate your taking the time to write and hope you will accept my apologies for any inconvenience you experienced from the street noise. ThisWe appreciate your patronage and hope you will stay with us at the Best Western Yacht Harbor Hotel the next time you are in San Diego. I can assure you we will do everything we can to make your stay a comfortable and happy one as we illustrate that what happened to you was an unfortunate exception to our normally high quality of service.Sincerely,Diane RambeauDirector of OperationsBest Western Yacht Harbor Hotel
1	A great hotel in a good location. I stayed at the Chicago Allegro for seven nights. Check-in was smooth, room was stylish and clean, everything worked. Nice bar with friendly service at the lobby level (thanks Raphael) and a good breakfast for a reasonable price if you decide to eat in. Good location and great access to all the things you want to do on foot or by public transport. Chris J,we love seeing 5* reviews - thank you! Raphael at Bar Allegro is amazing and we are so happy to have him as part of the team at the Allegro! Hoping you'll be back for some more libations served by him.Iris JungeRooms Director
1	What a wonderful girls weekend experience!!. I was hesitant staying here but I am extremely happy I did, our room was a very spacey corner double and it had a wonderful view. Customer service was incredible, Kathy was able to check us in a little earlier and I forgot his name but made a mean bacon and egg croissant sandwich. Hotel is in a great location 2 blocks away from Bourbon and one from Canal. Close to everything but far enough to hear all the noise. I would definitely stay there again especially for the great rate we got.Thanks so much for your review! I always enjoy sharing comments like these with our staff and giving Kathy and our cook, Mike the kudos they deserve. We are delighted you had a great time here with us and we look forward to having you back with us again soon.Cheers,Dixie Krauss, Operations Manager
0	What a Disappointment. The photo's looked fantastic. Our room however was not. The, a/c in the room was sellotaped into the window and was so noisy we couldn't sleep. Rooms were small. View was invisible due to the filthy windows and construction work opposite. The shower leaked and flooded the bathroom. The sink had no plug. No table or chest of drawers or anything in the room. This is in my opinion is scraping a 3 star if that definitely not a 4.We appreciate the feedback, Russell.We're disappointed that your stay with us was less than ideal. It's unfortunate you've noticed a decline in the quality of our accommodations, and that you had such challenges with your room. We care about the comfort of our guests so we'll address your concerns with our team moving forward.We hope for the opportunity to host you again soon for a more positive experience.
1	Excellent experience -3 day stay. The room (suite) was clean, quiet, nicely appointed, comfortable bed.The staff from check in to housekeeping were helpful, friendly, professional.Although hotel wasn't downtown, it was a great location and easy to get to all of the expressways, etc. to access downtown or airport. Close to shopping and restaurants.Dear cj80130,Thank you for your kind words regarding your stay at the Hawthorn Suites Dallas Park Central. We were glad to have you as our guest, and appreciate you taking the time to comment regarding your visit with us. We truly appreciate your kind words regarding our staff. You were very kind to recognize them. We look forward to the opportunity to host you again the next time you are in the Dallas area. Thanks again for being our guest! Best regards, Charlie Westhoven Operations Manager Hawthorn Suites Dallas Park Central
1	Convenient conference hotel. I stayed at the Grand Hyatt because I was attending a downtown Seattle conference and it was one of the selected conference hotels, although not the main hotel. I was upgraded to a corner king suite the room was very nice, and convenient since I was with my husband. Two separate rooms always makes life easier on the road, especially for a longer stay.The overall look of the hotel, including our room, was very fresh and pleasant. Very clean as well. We like the fact that many Hyatts now share space with Starbucks--very handy and a nice low-cost option for breakfast.The hotel lived up to our expectations, which were not too high since it is not positioned as a luxury hotel, in most ways. We did find the service a bit off. It seemed as though there were too few staff available to help--long lines at check in and out--but then that may have been a result of staying over a holiday weekend.
0	Room smelled like marijuanna. When we arrived in our room around 10:30 pm we noticed a very strong odor. We tried waiting it out for about an hour, but it never subsided. We think the smell was marijuana. At about midnight, we had to pack up all our stuff with a 3 and 5 year old and swap rooms. Hotel offered no type of reimbursement or anything.
1	Best beach front hotel in San Diego. What s not to like Ocean front, Boardwalk below, great food, shopping, grocery stores close by. Hotel has been recently remodeled which has taken it up to a new level. Very clean with the most polite and friendly staff you will find anywhere. I tried it year ago and now stay there as often as I can. Everyone at the front desk calls me by my name and welcomes me back. The manager comes out to say hello and there's nothing I need that they won't try to get for me. I work when I'm there so the recent upgrade in Internet has been a huge plus.Excellent review! We greatly appreciate all the kind words about both our staff and our hotel. We take a lot of pride in our customer service and it is very rewarding to hear that it made your stay that much more enjoyable. As for the hotel itself we are glad to hear that you were able to take advantage of our location and proximity to many fantastic local restaurants, shops, and even a grocery store and pharmacy. Thank you again for the helpful review and we look forward to seeing again you soon!
0	Very poorly ran hotel.. Bad experience. Most of the employees live at the hotel. Lady bartender was great but apparently the system in the restaurant went down all weekend so no food and very inconvenient to leave hotel to get food as the hotel is tucked way off in an industrial park. Room stank like feet, bathroom had stains on the wall, light fixtures nearly falling off the wall, carpets were very stained. Overall horrible hotel
1	a steal for the price. For the location (few min walk from park/MARTA stations), you cannot beat the price. The room is pretty clean and the hotel offered a comfortabl stay. However, I guess this is part of the desging scheme but there were no drawers in my room (there are number of shelves you can put your stuff on) and the lighting in the room was pretty sparce. So if you do not mind sprwling your stuff in the rom without storing them away in drawers, you would love this place!Dear yk303705,We are pleased to hear you find our hotel to be a great value and enjoy your experience while staying with us. We appreciate you sharing your review with us, and hope to see you again soon. Take care.
0	Worst motel I have ever used. I really wanted to like this place. On the plus side the view of the creek from the second floor balcony was quite nice. However this was more than offset by my actual experience. I was to stay for two days. My first room had a filthy AC, what appeared to be vomit residue on the covers and black mold... More
1	Great location and good value. We enjoyed our stay. It's comfortable, clean, very friendly and helpful staff. We had Valet Parking on arrival and a welcome glass of wine in the library bar (and there was a complementary glass at 5pm each eve). Great place to hang out and swap stories.The location was great for all we wanted to do. Do get a comfortable pair of sketchers (there is a shop near by buy one get second half price) as you will be walking up and down hills a lot! The air conditioning in our room 709 was a bit noisy so I was glad we did not need it much. You get a faint hum of the San Francisco sound at night which I loved and was not disturbing . We didn't dine in at all so can't comment on the food . So many eateries in San Fran. to choose from and loris for breakfast just down the hill a few yards on the same side has great choice and sensible price. We spent three nights here over a week end with another couple in the next room and we were able to shut the outer door and kept our own door open on occasions so great if you are with family or with close friends!Would certainly recommend staying here.
0	The worst hotel I have ever stayed at!. Filthy hotel. There were long black hairs on our bathroom floor. Candy wrappers and other garbage in the hallways. We were on the second floor and took the stairs. Stay out of the stairwells. They haven't been swept in months. Unfriendly staff.. Parking is across the street in a sketchy parking lot. Our experience was the worst ever. I suggest... More
1	A family experience. The King suite with 2 double beds is great, although very tight space. The beds are bunkbeds in a separate room with door. Each room has a TV. There is a heated swimming pool with hot tub.The staff was very friendly and helpful. Our room was at the end of the corridor, so very quiet.The price is very reasonable, but there is a large fee for parking.Dear Janet, Thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey regarding your recent stay at our hotel.Your feedback is very important to us and we can assure you that we will use this information to do everything possible to create an enjoyable experience for each of our guests. We hope to see you again soon!Sincerely,Art CollantesGeneral ManagerComfort Suites Mission Valley(619)-881-4000
0	Won't be returning. We stayed at this hotel back in October 2013 and enjoyed it very much.I wish the same could be said for this visit.The rates had climbed a bit for medical rates since our last visit ten months ago, but that's to be expected. What we hadn't expected was that the breakfast was no longer included with the room, and we had to pay 14 a person for it. It is too far for people with disabilities to walk anywhere else to eat, and the shuttle is unreliable at best, so we were stuck with eating breakfast there.The fans still don't work in the washrooms, which is very inconvenient, especially with my son having stomach issues every time we travel due to his health problems.The a/c was much too cold. When we turned it off, it would get too hot, since it's summer. You couldn't reach a balance.We had had issues the last time with waiting for hours for the shuttle to pick us up from the hospital. We had the same issue this time, and I ended up, once again, taking a taxi, so my son, who is very ill, wouldn't have to wait for hours after already having surgical appointments all day. I did talk to the front desk about it, and, to their credit, they comped us dinner, which was nice, and did improve the mood some.We will not be returning to Hilton Garden Inn, especially since five different amounts were coming out of my visa/debit account after returning home, and when calling to inquire about why this had occurred, I was told it was to factor in meals we had charged to the room, although I'm not sure why it would take five different credit/debits to establish that. There was still a discrepancy of 22 CAD that had nothing to do with the exchange rate, and that was not explained adequately to me. Not very satisfied.
1	Almost perfect hotel and location. We stayed at the hotel for three nights at the end or our three-weeks-trip throughout California. We were contacted by the hotel a few days before check-in if we want to apply for a stand-by-upgrade to a suite. As we travelled with two teenage-girls we applied and at check-in we were able to get a suite at a quite decent price.The whole establishment very nice and tastefully set . You feel like your in a kind of Mexican or Spanish estate. Same goes for the two-room suite, the kids were sleeping on the pull-out couch in the living-room. The bathroom had an almost huge size with a shower and a bathtub. The only reason why I don't give an excellent rating was an unpleasant episode on check-in. Right after check-in I got notified by my credit-card-company that the hotel had made two bookings for this stay. One corresponded with the lodging-price and the other was about the same sum but not exactly. When we asked at the front-desk, no one could really tell us what this was about. I don't want to tell the details here, but the sum was way to high for any possible additional charges. In the end this led to the fact, that this sum was blocked on my credit card for almost ten days after check-out.Dear ziggycop,We are delighted that you chose to stay at Estancia during your recent trip through California. It is wonderful to hear that you enjoyed your suite and the unique ambiance that our resort provides. Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback and please accept our deepest apologies for the inconvenience you experienced due to the issues with your credit card. Please look for a private message from us regarding this incident. Once again, thank you for staying with Estancia. We hope to welcome you back again soon!
1	Great staff and fabulous views. My husband stays here so regularly the hotel is practically his second home but it was great for me to come and experience it too. We have Executive club access so that always makes a stay very enjoyable and the staff in the lounge were particularly helpful. The hotel has recently been refurbished and while still very Marriott in style is has more personal touchs that I have seen in other properties. Big plus points are the location, loads of great restaurants in easy walking distance, wonderful friendly helpful staff at all levels and a new thing was the little market shop by reception which was fantastic, not only the sweets etc that you would expect but drawers of everything from new shirts and ties to aspirin etc plus although pricey not unreasonable - my 4 headache pills were 3 but a necessity at the time. The only reason I am not giving the hotel and excellent is the very long wait for room service on Sunday night, Our pizza took forever to arrive and we had 2 or 3 phone calls to see if it was there or not which didn't inspire confidence that it was ever coming!
1	Thank you. Staff was friendly and out going. Room was clean and received room service while out with the family. Very happy to have stayed at this place. Only thing i did not like was I could hear everything going on outside beyond closed doors as it woke me up each time I heard someone speak or doors slammed. Perhaps better insulation would help with that issue. Other than that, everything else was great! Thanks for a good stay! It was a pleasure hosting you and your family during your recent travels to San Diego! We hope you had the chance to enjoy some of the sights and attractions our city has to offer. Your encouraging words to our friendly staff members will be shared with the team to ensure they receive your recognition. Thank you for choosing our conveniently located accommodations for your stay and for taking the time to let us know how we are doing. It saddens us to know anything was less than perfect and you experienced some high noise levels. During your next visit to the area, we hope to be given the chance to better accommodate you and ensure you receive the restful night you deserve. Once again, thank you for choosing Ramada Limited San Diego.
0	Horrible service! Dirty, grimy smelly! Avoid!. Called the hotel prior arrival to get more info but each time I get someone that's so rude over the phone. When we arrived at the hotel there was a huge line at check-in. The front desk agent was cold and didn't even make eye contact or greet us. We checked into the Annex side of the building...OMG how disgusting the Annex is!!! Better off at Motel 6! The elevator is so old scary...looks like from a horror movie. The hallway leading to our room was dark and dingy with broken lights. We couldn't find our room 205 because there was missing door on our door...we just guessed which room it was and stuck our key in and it worked. The bathroom was a nasty pink color with musty mildew around the dirty gray tub. Bathroom tiles on the floor was old, scratched, stained chipped! I found tiny hairs around the base of the toilet and sink. The carpet wall in the room were full of stains as well. We wore shoes at all times trying to avoid stepping on the stains. We asked for a wakeup call at 9am but they nevered called to wake us up. We woke up late at 10:30am and missed breakfast. Called the front desk to complain about not recieving a wake up call got Garry over the phone he implied that maybe we overselpt the wakeup call...His implications were RUDE obnoxious! I asked him for a late checkout and he offered extra 30min...How cheap stingy is that! Most hotels in AC have a 12pm checkout time... this place offers 11am checkout with 30mins late checkout! CHEAP! CHEAP! CHEAP! Tropicana offered me 4pm late checkout once FREE of charge. I will never stay at this disgusting place again! AVOID at all cost!
1	Hyatt House is pet friendly. We always use Hyatt for all inclusive vacations but this time traveling through the US we decided to try Hyatt House. We were traveling with our 2 dogs - we were a little taken back by the non-refundable pet fee of 75 for nights 1-7, we were only staying one night and thought this was a little steep. However, after checking in and seeing the cleanliness of our room, being a pet friendly room you expect to find at least one sign another dog had been there - Nope! Immaculate! Great cleaning staff! This location is very convenient and we will stay here again. The hot breakfast was delicious. The staff very accommodating. Nice place all the way around. 5 stars!
0	just better than sleeping in your car if it's raining. Dirty, old soap on floor of shower, real thin 2 towels, only 1/2roll TP, bed real soft lumpy, no water glass, smelled moldy, the AC Was so noisy whenever it decided to cycle would wake up Rip VanWinkle. I looked for Cheep and I got it.
1	Great Hotel, Great Staff, Excellent Stay. My wife and I stayed at the St Regis for 8 nights in June 2018 as part pleasure part business trip. This was our second time at the hotel and we cannot fault it. The staff were exceptional and made our stay very memorable. The hotel's location made it great to get around the City and the friendliness of the staff made our time there very enjoyable. Janelle in the fitness centre was a particular favourite of ours as she made going to the gym in the mornings a very welcoming and friendly experience. We will definitely stay here upon our return to New York CityDear GK1708,Thank you very much for taking the time to review your recent stay at The St. Regis New York. We are very pleased to hear how much you enjoyed your stay, and especially your experience in the Athletic Club. We will share your kind comments with Janelle and the team, and we look forward to seeing you again soon.Kindest Regards,Senih GerayGeneral Manager
0	Beauty is not the best. We booked this hotel as it offered close proximity to the the centre of New Orleans and it offered disabled facilities in 'superior' rooms. We arrived late because we took the Amtrak from New York 36hrs we arrived at 21.30, very tired. Expecting a decent night sleep we were told they did not have a double room with a disabled friendly shower but a single room on the 7th Floor(they had elevators) with the correct shower. They asked was this acceptable We were so tired we said yes Ok. We were then informed that we would be charges an additional 50 per night for 12 nights for 'extras'. Extras we asked what extras/ Food, movies, drinks, breakfast.We were so tired we said OK. They then hit my card for 3000 - before leaving London we had agreed with our card company that no transaction would exceed 2800 as we had had stolen/lost cards in the past. We had forgotten this limit and the receptionist said the card was rejected. We could not work out why this had happened. So we paid for 1 night with the intention to sort the problem in the morning. However when we went up to the room we were delighted with the bathroom and felt that the size of the room was just about adequate. I was still upset about the card being rejected so I called the 'local' number of my bank. They confirmed there were no problems but reminded me of the limit I had set. As the room did not have a fridge or safe and as we were so tired I decided to deal with the problems in the morning. The following day I went to reception and the manager (i presume) allowed me to pay the bill account on 2 cards saying he understood why this had happened. I asked anbot a fridge he said it would be delivered. There was no safe available. I was not asked to pay the 'extra' this time so payment was made of a further 2200 split on the 2 cards. We went out and on our return found a fridge of 3ft square in the bedroom - so large that it hampered access to the bathroom. We had eaten out so thought we would watch a movie. The TV in our room refused to show us what was available so I rang reception - only no the line was still connected to my European Bamk on the local number. This phone call connection lasted 3 days.and paid 17.98 3minute . So, in spite of my disability I went down to reception and was told that they did not offer movies! As i had paid I could not afford to move and so we were stuck in this hotel. Finally on our last day no one helped with the luggage. I would write a lot but no more room We're glad you found the room size adequate and were delighted with the bathroom. I'm sorry to hear your bank gave you so much trouble with your credit card but happy to hear the desk manager was able to work around it. The reason you didn't have movies is because the 50.00 per night hold for incidentals (like movies, room charges, etc.) was waived due to the issues you were having with your bank and the monetary limits you had set. Also, (and again, in an effort to make you more comfortable) a fridge was placed in your room. I'm sorry to hear you thought it was too large but it's the smallest one we had. Additionally, your phone charges were waived when you didn't disconnect the International call. I am truly sorry to hear you did not enjoy your experience at the Whitney Hotel but it sounds like the staff went above and beyond to serve you and you were satisfied with the room so thank you again for mentioning that. If there is further information you would like me to review, please don't hesitate to contact me. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
0	Stay Away. We made reservations on November 9, 2011 for a stay on the night of May 16, 2012 and specifically asked for a non-smoking room. When we arrived at 11 p.m., the desk clerk casually told us the only room left was a smoking room. No explanation as to what had happen to our reservation for a non-smoking room. No apology. She couldn't have cared less. The smell that greeted us when we opened the door to the room was unbelievable. I slept with a clean towel on my pillow to avoid the tobacco smell that permeated every inch of the room. Not going back there anytime soon.
1	Great place to relax. I have been staying at Estancia for over 10 years and it is a lovely property in a quiet, but central location in La Jolla, near San Diego, around many beautiful beaches and golf courses. The hotel offers nice, manicured gardens, comfortable rooms, a Spa, excercise room, swimming pool, and two restaurants and bars. The beakfast buffet is quite good. The service is helpful and the hotel has valet parking. The guys that park your car are very friendly and helpful with directions and general information. It is a beautiful hotel, but it is not luxurious! Don't expect the 4 Seasons! My tip is to buy a package including breakfast and car parking. Although the price goes up, there is no unpleasant surprises at check out and you can order whatever you want for breakfast without worrying about the cost. The hotel is a lovely location for weddings and there are always several taking place on the weekends. Thank you so much for the review and for staying with us for nearly ten years! It sounds like you enjoyed nearly all of our amenities during your recent trip. We are happy to hear that one of your favorites is the breakfast buffet. Great tip on going with a package! We hope to see you again soon!
1	Very impressed! I already want to come back!. This was one of the most memorable hotels I've stayed at from it's eclectic and fun vibe to the gracious and friendly staff. We were greeted by Angel who was top notch at explaining the hotel re-image as well as was incredibly thorough on explaining the room we reserved, it's accommodations and the awesome tablet that is a connection has everything you'll need from room service to tourist information. I will be coming to Phoenix more often in the coming years and this hotel will be where I will be staying. The room was clean and gorgeous. We were taking pictures for the first few minutes of arriving because the set-up was so appealing and balcony view of downtown Phoenix was breathtaking. We stayed in the balcony king suite and for the price-point it was such a great value. I will be recommending this hotel to anyone visiting central Arizona. Thank you to the staff and management for making a quick one night trip so much fun. You all did a superb job at conveying what your ideology for a great hotel is. P.S. The amount of charging/usb charging ports you have around the room make a techy like me giddy. James! Thank you for making out day! We're so happy to hear you loved the hotel and enjoyed your stay. We appreciate you taking the time to share your experience with us. We do hope you will come back and visit us again soon.
0	Four Points. There was a free breakfast buffet, but the hotel did not let us know the hours of it. When we showed up at 9:32, they said it closed at 9:30. We reserved a king sized bed and got a room with two doubles. They told us we were not guaranteed the bed choice that we wanted. There is no restaurant, lounge or bar as it says on the website. The shuttle was good to use and runs pretty much every 30 minutes up to 4:30 ish. If you need to return to the hotel after 10:10 when the shuttle stops, take a taxi. The cost was 7.50 and it was worth it. The nearest metro station is too far from D.C. Next time I will stay at the Virginian Suites in Arlington again.
1	Great Location for Conference. Recently stayed at the Renaissance Hotel Waverly in Atlanta and was impressed by the professionalism and friendly attitude of the staff as well as the accommodations. Room was large and quite spacious with wrap around windows that offered a nice view from the 7th floor. King sized bed and desk and complimentary Internet. Clean and looked to be recently renovated. Good location near shopping and restaurants and about 30-40 minutes to the Airport. I'd recommend this location for large group gatherings too as the atrium area makes for a nice visual with lots of space to get together.Thank you for the post regarding your stay with us, we hope to see you back soon!
1	Not really handicapped accessible. We called the hotel directly and were told we would have a walk-in shower, and that handicapped parking was directly outside of the handicapped rooms. We were given a non-handicapped room the first night, and parking was not close. They provided cones to block-off a space to allow for close parking and moved us to a handicapped room. The staff was very professional (other than one who swore in Spanish). We would probably stay again if they decide to create more accessible parking.Good Morning,I appreciate you taking time to review your stay with us here through TripAdvisor. I apologize the wrong information was given when you made your reservation. Our general manager is looking into converting two of our parking spaces into handicapped parking spaces because of comments like yours. Thank you.I'm very happy to know you were happy with the accommodations that were done to move you into a walk in shower room and reserved the parking in front of your room. Once again thank you for staying with us. We hope you come back and stay with us again!

0	Bad area . Dirty. This is a one Star hotel . Dirty , smelly , in bad area . Definitely will not chose BW in future
0	Not for a Tourist. Old and out of date.. Trip was Oct 16-18. Hotel is not suitable for normal tourists. It is adjacent to and connected to a hospital. It may be suitable for patients or their families, but it is not something a tourist would want. The hotel is very old. There is a skeleton staff. The web site shows a nice food service area or restaurant. During our stay, there was no restaurant at all. These photos should be taken down. They are misleading at the least. There is no parking with this hotel. The desk will refer you to a public lot around the corner. The public parking has issues: (a) it has limited spaces for public use and you may be out of luck on a busy time (we did find one available) (b) it is not cheap (c) the main complaint here is that there is no in and out in this public lot. So, this is not like a valet parking where you pay one day and can go in and out. You park and are stuck or risk additional fees etc. The rooms are very small. The bathroom is tiny (one person only). The furniture in the room is old and not comfortable. Two chairs and a small table. You must be in the bed to view the TV comfortably. Food: as noted, there is no restaurant in the hotel. The food - - aka room service actually comes from the hospital kitchen. There is an elevator connection to the hospital, and you can eat in the hospital cafeteria. Otherwise, there is no food in the hotel. The staff was one person at the desk. No bell man etc. There may be ways to get a wheel chair into the hotel, but I did not see them. I saw several elderly ladies in walkers have a very difficult time getting up the 6 to 9 stairs at the entrance. The owners have put no money to update this hotel. If you call one of the room service numbers, the first prompt is for you to provide your glucose tolerance numbers. Quite a shock for a tourist with a first time in Seattle. On one occasion, I called the front desk. Let it ring 15 to 20 times. No answer. When I went down, I asked: why was no one answering the phone at the desk The answer: I was out for a moment across the street. It is also worth noting that there is only one elevator in the hotel for guests. Not a problem as long as few people are in the hotel. It was very slow a few times when the Seahawks game came closer. This is not an upscale neighborhood. There is a nice breakfast place about a 5 minute walk away. Starbucks an easy 10 minute walk (Well run Starbucks). From what we saw walking down to the ferry would not wise. There are good number of homeless folks down closer to the Seahawks and Mariners stadium (a Salvation army facility is quite near the stadiums). I did not feel it was unsafe for myself, but would not want my wife and I to walk that way. In summary, THIS HOTEL IS AN HOSPITAL ADJUNCT. It is not a place where a tourist would want to stay unless were the dominant concern and staying downtown was required. It is simply a very old hotel with limited staff, no food (unless you like hospital food), misleading photos on the Trip Advisor site showing a food area, no parking, and nothing to show that the owners have put any at all to improve it. I booked on hotel.com and was disappointed. For the price one does not expect a 4 star facility. But one would expect more than what this hotel provides.Thank you for your review. We are sorry to learn you did not enjoy your stay with us. The Inn is older. . .many of our guests find it charming and comfortable. The setting is more residential, off the main shopping/activity corridor but convenient enough you can still walk to Pike Place Market or the Convention Center. We are very close to opening our restaurant and I apologize you did not enjoy the room service selection provided on our menu. We are very proud to be a part of the Virginia Mason Medical Center campus. About 40 of our guests are tourists and 60 of our guests are here for medical related visits at one of the three major medical facilities in the area. And we are happy to welcome everyone. We wish you safe travels!
1	A Great Stay-. Stayed 3 Nights. Hotel Ruby of Ponderay has a great appearance. There are many wide parking spots. It is nicely kept with a very open and modern looking lobby that includes a common area TV and dinning facility. The Staff is friendly and kind. Breakfast, though basic was good and satisfying with the bonus of a waffle maker (Which I always like). The room was very clean and the bed was soft and comfortable. Temperature control worked great. The room was not as spacious as other hotels rooms can be, but there is also no wasted space. Wifi worked very well and has several routers depending on what section of the hotel you are in. The pool and sauna were nice too. And did I mention the price. Best deal in town price wise. If I ever return to Ponderay, this Hotel would be my first choice.
1	Great Hotel. We were pleasantly surprised when my hubby had to go to a meeting and this is where they put us .. The hotel was very clean and quite.. We went down to the pool and hot tub and we were the only ones using it and it was so nice... The staff was friendly and very helpful ...Thank you for posting your nice comments and letting us know the staff was friendly and helpful during your visit. I am pleased you enjoyed our pool and hot tub without distractions. I myself find it very relaxing to have a nice swim or soak in the hot tub when traveling. We hope you will be able to visit us again the next time your travels bring you to Atlanta.
1	Friendly, Helpful Staff a Good Deal, But Sketchy Area. You get what you pay for this is a great deal if you don't mind the area. Staff was very friendly helpful and rooms, bedding bathroom was clean. Here are some tips/info you should know: It is right across the street from a facility where the homeless get services they are always hanging out there. The closest BART station, Civic Center, pops up in the middle of what could be called a homeless tent city. As a woman with 3 children traveling with me, all wheeling airport bags, we were very out of place walking to the hotel the kids were terrified. I felt much safer walking to the hotel from the west side-Van Ness street where there is great access to public transport.I wouldn't rule out going back to the Monarch on another trip if I needed a budget hotel, but I wouldn't bring kids there I'm not sure I'd go alone.Erica H,Thank for such a well-thought out and kind review. We always appreciate when a guest has taken the time to be so thorough. I am glad that you enjoyed stay at our hotel. We aim to provide comfortable, pleasant stay at a very competitive price. Thanks again for your stay and we sincerely hope that you visit us soon again next time you visit San Francisco.
1	Great boutique hotel in the heart of SF. Had a wonderful deluxe king on the 7th floor (room 709) in the back of the building so it was nice and quiet. (Remember that in downtown SF, any room in any hotel that faces the street will be loud and noisy due to the noise on the street--no hotel can guard against this.) The room decor was nice and modern with a dash of whimsy. Plenty of hangers in the closet plus a small safe for my iPad and other valuables. Fabulous slanted bar glasses in the room--I want to find them for my home. The bathroom was huge with a private WC. I loved the PURE bathroom amenities--will also need to shop for these for my home. Staff was very friendly. They are doing some remodeling but it never bothered me. It is targeted to be done in September 2016. Great location near Union Square and BART/MUNI stops. Starbucks is right next door as is a good upper-scale Mexican restaurant with a great bar.WOW! Thank you for sharing your 5 star Diva experience with us! We are delighted to hear you found our rooms wonderful, staff friendly and location great! We really appreciate you taking the time to review us and look forward to seeing you again in the future!
1	Convenient and comfortable. Having a full kitchen is a great feature and breakfast included is a nice way to start the day. Our room was close to the office and that worked out well for us. Our only complaint was that the bathroom door, room 202, did not lock. All staff were very friendly anf helpful. A schedule for the shuttle would have helped and notification that there is a senior rate for the shuttle.We are delighted to have been your chosen hotel during your recent stay in Anaheim. It wastruly a pleasure to serve you.We appreciate your business and value your honest feedback. Your comments have been shared withthe hotel team as a critical way of understanding how we can continue to deliver exceptional serviceto guests like you.Thank you for staying at the TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium and we hope you choose to create more memories withus whenever your travels bring you back to Anaheim.Sincerely,Edgar RiveraGeneral ManagerTownePlace Suites by Marriottedgar.riveramarriott.com714-939-9700
0	Can't believe we paid this much for a room here!. Was trying to find a room last minute and the hotels in our price range were booked. A room at the Econo Lodge opened up so I grabbed it. Had I read the reviews here I may have reconsidered. When you pay 139/night you expect something decent. When we pulled up around 10 pm to check-in the lobby was dark... More
1	Excellent. Everything was great. The workers at the front desk are all nice and very helpful. All the rooms are suites and they are all very clean and spacious. The best thing about it is the proximity to Angel Stadium. We went to go watch the Giants play the Angels for two days and the hotel is literally across the street from the stadium. They even let you choose what you want from their continental breakfast when you check in and have it ready for you to pick up in the morning in the lobby. There are also places to eat very close by and although we didn't get in (not enough time) the pool it looked clean and like a nice place to relax. I will definitely stay here again whenever I am in Anaheim, great hotel for a great price.
0	Terrib;e. For some reason according to the front desk the regular queen room booked from Hotels.com gave us a handicap room. I stayed at a wonderful Red Roof Inn in Boston a few years ago. Since then i have been to 2 in Pennsylvania. It is definitely not the same. Won't be staying at red roof again
0	Close to beach, but old and dirty. Sink had leak, which soaked the entire counter top. Given rags to wrap around the faucet and told that no maintenance person available. Given option to move on last night there. Outlets do not work, plugs fall out. Coffee pot never cleaned out. Towels received were stained. On first arrival, toilet had some poop floating in it. Phone did not work, no dial tone, no way to contact front desk. Went to continental breakfast, and muffins were covered with ants. She put them away, but next morning, the muffins served were stale. I believe she saved them and served them the next day.
1	If i could afford the flight i would definitely go back to the Luana. At first we were disappointed at our room being on the 2nd floor but it still had great views and possibly the best balcony in the whole hotel. The one bedroom apartment we stayed in was lovely and had all the equipment you could ever...MoreAloha elainebarden, Thank you for a perfect five-star review and Mahalo for taking the time in sharing your experience with us! We are glad to hear that you enjoyed the one-bedroom suite and your vacation with us. Mahalo for commending our concierge, Tyler. Thank you...More
1	awesome stay. I love this hotel. It was cheaper than the ones - Sheraton and Marriott on Canal - where a conference I was attending was held. The decor is beautiful (Erykah Badu-like art on the wall and retro galore with a bit of artisan flare). My room was at the end of the corner and I didn't hear a thing, a privilege when traveling in a major city. The front desk manager called later to see if I had a good stay. Shout-out to Kavana at the front desk who was kind up my check out and departure as well as the people working in the first floor restaurant. The endive salad and fish was a perfect meal. The roof top bar looked like a lot of fun, but aside from a quick snap shot, I didn't stay as I needed to decompress from my travels. But I shall return. 12-15 minute safe walk to the Quarter. Take Rampart or any parallel street to Canal and head toward river.Thank you for taking the time to review our property and we are delighted to know you had a great stay with us. It sounds like every part of your experience at our hotel was perfect which is music to our ears. We certainly appreciate you staying with us and look forward to having you back as our guest whenever your travels bring you back to Nola.Best regards,
0	Bugs Bugs Bugs. Other than the staff, this was the worst hotel experiences I and my traveling companions have ever had. Per the hotel manager there was an ant infestation they had resolved, they had not. Both my sister and I received several bug bites. Hoterl staff was nonesistent. We came back after being out and the one trash can was empied but sittting in the living area, the toilet paper had not been stocked and towels were left on top of our luggage as opposed to hung in the appropriate area, the toilet overflowed the first time we used it. And finally and most disgusting was that a used condom was ound in one of the nightstands (ewww). Now on to the facilities. The levator was out of order one night, unruly and unsupervised children were left to run roughshod over the pool area. We were subjected to splashes in our face, yelling and our belongings being knocked over (staff did not come to check even though everal adults complained). We spent a total of a half hour of our 3 day stay in the whirlppl finally giving up to sit on the sun deck in order to have some peace and quiet. Only issue with staff was when my sister went to the fornt desk to ask for a hand towel so that she could wipe the sweat of her face(August in Virgina is hot as Hades) and the desk personnel told her that they did not have any and gave her a bat mat instead. To reiterate, the entire experience beyond the pleasant staff was horrific... DO NOT STAY HERE!!!
1	Nice stay. Close to where we needed to be good breakfast, staff was great price was ok internet a little jumpy and had to ask for wash cloths bath fan stopped working but otherwise good stay would stay again.Lots of places to eat close.Thank you so much for your positive feed back we appreciate it very much. We do apologize about any inconveniences during your stay and we will work on any matter that needs service as soon as we can be of service. I'm glad you enjoyed your stay and was able to eat at near by places that suited your convenience. I'm pleased to hear that your breakfast was enjoyable and that staff gave you a great feeling. We always strive to give the best customer service to our guests and I'm glad you felt your stay was great. Thank you for your business and we hope to see you and serve you again soon.
1	Great hostel near Michigan Avenue. This is a well priced hostel, only a couple blocks off Michigan Avenue, The Magnificent Mile, the main shopping district of the city. The Hostel is very modern, feels safe, is clean, with lockers in your room for your stuff, free wi-fi and the beds are comfortable. The bar on the main floor has a great selection of drinks and is very welcoming. The staff are all very friendly, and are willing to help with any questions you may have. A great hub for exploring the major city sites, and restaurants, and is considerably cheaper than getting a single room in any of the major hotels nearby.If you're good with hostels, and their atmosphere, I really cannot recommend anywhere better to stay in Chicago!Hi MattSRob, Thank you for staying with us and for reviewing your stay. I am so glad to hear you loved your Freehand experienced and found our location and value to be excellent. I am also glad to hear you had a chance to enjoy the Broken Shaker during your visit and that our staff took such great care of you. I hope we can see you back again very soon.
0	Would not go here again, next time Red Lion. First night was okay, there a band aid was in the pool, my gf pointed it out and we left to our room. Second night a water pipe burst causing water outage for the whole building and damaging their computer area. Our room and our friends adjacent room had ants in it. The phone in our room was not connecting to any inner hotel numbers so we couldn't have notified them of this issue or any medical emergency even if we wanted to using their phone system. When we left Sunday morning I notified the front desk of these issues and they said hotel GM would be calling me to try and rectify the situation. This never happened. After waiting a week I contacted the hotel for a refund for the one night and they informed me since I booked through Expedia I would have to contact them. After getting a hold of Expedia they contacted the hotel and were able to retrieve 1/2 of the cost of the night. I was amazed the hotel would not refund us our entire night considering the conditions of the rooms and lack of basic services. We could not go to the bathroom for the entire night (verified this at 10 PM, and again in the morning at 10 AM, the water in the toilets were backing up after one flush) and had to drive down to Chevron a few miles down the road to use their facilities and purchase drinking water. I can't even begin to comprehend how refunding half the night for these kind of inconveniences is fair to anyone who stayed during this time. I cannot recommend this place.
1	Enjoyed the stay. We stayed four four nights in July on a mini vacation. The room was clean and in good shape however it was a bit dated. I got the feeling that the clientele may have been suspect in the past as there were signs informing you that you'll be charged if this or that is missing form the room. The AC controls require you to put a room key in a slot next to the door which is odd and our room the AC was out on night one. Maintenance quickly fixed this which ended up bypassing this key card interlock so it was a non issue. The wifi in the room was unusable due to low signal. Not sure if it is better by the pool as I never tried but that was disappointing. The location is excellent for beach access although at night it's not exactly family friendly on the street side of the hotel. The staff was very friendly and responsive to our needs. The common areas were very nice and clean. They had beach toys for use and showers with hot water at the entrance form the beach so you can wash off the beach in comfort. The pool and hot tub worked as they should albeit a bit out dated and the poo was in need of repair. No big deal but the water line tile is in need of replacement. That said the pool clean and clear and maintained daily. The hotel supplies towels for the both the pool and the beach which is a really nice feature just make sure the beach towels come back as if they are missing they are 50 each. Overall the hotel was nice, the staff was excellent, and the location very good. Updated rooms with better (read quieter) AC units and useable wifi would garner an excellent review. That said we will look to this property again next year on our annual beat the heat of Phoenix trip to San Diego.Thank you for the review! We're sorry to hear about the WiFi - someone regularly checks the signals, so we'll go back and make sure something wasn't missed. And rest assured, charging guests who take home our nice beach towels or bath robes is standard in the industry - it has nothing to do with the type of clientele here at the hotel!It sounds like you had a very enjoyable vacation here in San Diego. You'll also be happy to know this fall we will continue renovations of our rooms, so when you're ready to escape the scorching desert temperatures next year, check us out again! See you soon!
0	Disappointed with the Service. The Hotel itself is nice and fairly clean. However, booked the hotel months ago and when we arrived, which was late and after 12am, we were told that our twin room was not available, they had sold it, and we could have a double room with 1 bed. They were going to put up a portable bed, but took them a while to find it. We were offered to go to other hotel, but they were fully booked too. The hotel changed the room the following night, but no compensation, apart from a free drink which we had to fight for as well, were offered.
1	Efficient, Modern Hotel. I stayed here for four nights while at a conference at a hotel down the street. The Aloft is centrally located, the staff were extremely helpful, and the room furnishings were streamlined and nice. The only issues I had were with noise (the walls are a bit thin, and on Saturday night the noise from upstairs and nextdoor neughbours was a bit much) and with housekeeping. They give you the option to decline housekeeping by-the-night in exchange for a 5 voucher or rewards programme credits. You indicate this using a door tag. I declined the first night, but didn't put the tag out on the other nights because I wanted housekeeping to come. Instead, I found vouchers under the door both days and no housekeeping had been done. This didn't put me out overly much, but it was a bit annoying.
0	Fresh oil? stain on pillow. This hotel looks new and appears to have been newly updated. The breakfast area is very nice and has a homey feeling yet has a very contemporary style. The service at the front desk was speedy and very professional awesome reception with the friendliest staff. The rooms layout is very traditional going back to the older times. Even with some signs of upgrades, it felt to be a very old room. I think the dcor needed to be better and the appliances upgraded. The first thing I spotted entering the room was the throw pillow on the bed with what appears to be a large oil stain (hoping it is oil or grease) in the smack center of the pillow facing right at you. That sight alone made me think that the rooms upkeep was not up to par. I cannot understand why the pillow was even left for display in the room. The bathroom did not have a fan, showering in it created a very steamy room that made the rooms mirrors useless. Water pressure was awesome and the fixtures are all brand new. There was no complimentary bottled water in the room. There is no vending machine in the hotel however, there are candies for sale prominently displayed in the main lobby. The breakfast offered was good and plentiful. As I was getting ready for a biscuit, the lady refilling the biscuit tray rearranged the biscuits with her BARE hands and then with her BARE hands placed new biscuits into the tray. After seeing it, I changed my mind about having the biscuit.
0	Stolen camera in the lobby. This is by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. As a loyal platinum member I was hoping the general manager Anonio Demarco would be able to assist my husband and I with a huge dilemma we encountered, which was our camera (SLR) , stolen inside their lobby while we were checking out.we were instructed to file a police report and were somewhat assured to have access to the security tapes to find the culprit. Antonio was inconsiderate, rude, and simply lacked empathetic skills while speaking to us. He told he will not show us because he does not have to, blamed us for our item being stolen. never stay here! They have zero security outside and inside, lobbies are empty anyone can walk in and out and steal your luggage. Poorly designed rooms, thin walls, you can hear your neighbors literally whispering. Hot water was not even hot. Poor hotel and poor management. Extremely dissatisfied and regret booking.
0	Not what I paid for or expected.. Well first off, I paid for a King with a sofa bed Non-smoking. When I arrived and checked in, once in the room I discovered I had been given a full size bed. I immediately called down to the front-desk and the manager said she was all out of Non-smoking King rooms and that she didn't know why Hotels.com booked me and charged me for that room. I told her I had paid for it already and was told that I would have to take it up with Hotels.com. I was extremely upset and she offered me a Smoking King room. I wasn't comfortable with that but because my two small boys wanted to stay in the hotel (just for the pool) I agreed to the king room smoking. We all have allergies so I was a bit uncomfortable staying there but did it to please my boys.
0	I work for choice hotels and I am absolutly ashamed to have this place has a chain of our hotels. Place is so dirty and not well kept, but what got me the most is how unprofessional the night auditor was!!! He had such a bad attitude I even said to cancel my reservation cause I didn't care for his attitude. After I said that he immediately worked on my reservation faster and made sure I stayed, so I did.... More
0	Trip with grandson. Or stay was just okay, hotel in need of some work.
0	Horrible!!'. This hotel has bedbugs!! The staff acted like it wasn't a big idea!! Don't stay here!!
1	Got the job done. Didn't stay long enough to really review things, but the room was pretty clean, even though I think my toilet was leaking. Speaking of toilets, you kinda have to jump over it to get to the shower which has a really low shower head. Not good for a 6' tall person. Be wary of the elevator, it's kinda creepy. Didn't get to check out the pool, but it looked decent enough. Friendly front desk service. Not the best location as far as traffic goes, but it's 15 minutes from most anything (amphitheater, beach, etc) so it was a pretty good spot to spend the night. If you're wanting an ocean-view, look elsewhere. It's worth the price I paid.
1	Great Service. Great Experience.. We where a late check in and Juliana was so accommodating. I spoke to her a few hours earlier to ask if someone can set up the sofa bed on the room since we where running late and going straight to bed. She did that for us, which I really appreciate. Thanks. The breakfast was delicious and the two attendances where so sweet. I don't remember their names, but I just want to say thanks. The lady that speaks noticed my puertorrican accent and told me that she hopes that everything is good with my family back in the island.

1	Modern and affordable. Highly recommended!. My boyfriend and I stayed here a weekend in July for our anniversary. Wanted to visit Baltimore but not pay the prices for the Inner Harbor hotels. This hotel was perfect. It was extremely affordable for a 2 night weekend stay and surpassed our expectations. It was only a 15 minute drive to Inner Harbor. The staff was very friendly and the room was great. Room was spacious, updated and SO clean. Felt like a mini apartment. Also one of the few hotels we found that had an outside pool. I would definitely recommend this hotel!
1	Quiet, comfortable hotel. Spacious and clean room. Very comfortable and firm bed with down pillows and comforter. We had no problem connecting to the free WiFi. Little luxuries in the room included a Keurig machine, k-cups and a mini fridge. We arrived after 1:00 AM and someone was still at the front desk to greet us. There is a nice little area next to the front desk where they sell snacks, drinks (including beer) and basic toiletry items. The indoor pool is open 6:00am - 11:00pm - didn't get to experience it but it looked very nice - there is also a hot tub. Made reservation for a smoking room however, the entire building is smoke free FYI. There is breakfast served next to the lobby area in the morning - there is a continental breakfast (6.95) or a breakfast buffet (9.95). We had the buffet and it was very good - you can order custom omelets and they had biscuits, sausage gravy, bacon, sausage, grits and eggs all hot and ready. There is also milk, juice, and soda available. We also liked the late check-out time (12 noon) since we got in so late. We would definitely stay here again - overall, very happy we picked this hotel!
1	napa stay. first trip to napa and chose hotel on location, price, parking, breakfast and free internet. older property but clean, safe, comfortable bed. internet worked well. at time of check in, they had special for breakfast at denny's next door if member of best western rewards or if willing to join. am member best western rewards and we took advantage of hot cooked to order breakfast at denny's. very good. convenient to downtown napa for restaurants and to wine trailAnita2412 - It sounds like you had a successful first trip to Napa. We are conveniently located close to everything Napa has to offer, just a little over a mile from Downtown Napa and it's famous restaurants wine bars as well as just a few minutes from the closest winery. We hope to see you again soon!Thank you, Genafer -Director of Sales
0	Enjoy the city elsewhere. We were looking for a last minute day trip for the president's day weekend and because it was last minute our top three choices were booked, so we decided on this inn. We booked a suite and the rooms were clean, had fresh towels and coffee throughout the stay the microwave and small fridge were also nice.On our 3rd night someone walked right into our room at about 2 in the morning!! OMG scared the living heck out of us informed the management in the a.m. he didn't seem too concerned, actually he seemed annoyed.Yes it is within walking distance of all the best places, but the breakfast is laughable, and I swear there are working girls/men or druggies who frequent this hotel, there is just too much foot traffic on the balcony at odd times of the night,the management is just plain rude, once you have paid your money you are out of luck and they don't care. Do yourself a favor stay elsewhere and enjoy San Francisco it is a great city!!
1	Great hotel with lovely staff. We stayed here basically due to price. It was excellent choice! The hotel is charming with comfortable beds and within easy walking of just about everything. The staff were helpful and accomodating as we were first timers to NOLA. It has a lovely pool and garden area. I'd happily stay here again and upgrade to one of the rooms with a balcony. The only suggestion I would have is a bit of improvement on the breakfast might be beneficial but since NOLA is full of restaurants there are innumerable other options.Nancy, we are so pleased that you enjoyed our charm, comfortable beds, great location, and price tag! Our courtyard pool is our favorite oasis in the French Quarter. We look forward to hosting you again for another luxurious stay soon!
0	Vacuum the carpets!. When we walked into our room we found bugs dead and alive in the room. When we searched further we found more dead bugs. They should do a better job of vacuuming the rooms including behind beds tv and fridge.
1	Four night stay. Entire staff was both accommodating and extreemly pleasant. Room was very clean and quiet. I recommend this hotel and plan to stay there when I visit Atlanta later in the new year. The only thing that could be improve upon is to serve a full breakfast buffet YUM!I want to thank you for taking the time to post a review of your stay. It is pleasing to know you were well accommodated by our staff and that you would recommend our hotel. Thank you again for your review. It would be our pleasure for you to repeat your experience with us in the future.
1	Excellent everything. I have only great things to say about Orchard Garden Hotel. The location is ideal and the room was spotless (it's not very often I feel comfortable taking a bath in a hotel but I did there every day). The staff was helpful and very friendly, made me feel very much at home. Wifi worked well. I would stay there again.We're delighted you were able to relax with some cozy bath time, Denise! Vacation is all about feeling calm and comfortable while you explore a new place. We'd love to have you back someday!Wishing you all the best,The Orchard Garden Hotel
0	disgusting. we didn't even stay there , we had friends drive by 3 days prior to our stay and they told us the place was in disrepair , screens out and filthy. we tried to call them for 3 days to cancel our reservations and they did not answer the phone. On the day we arrived we tried to call again and they finally answered the phone we told them our problems with the hotel and they yelled to late to cancel and hung up on us . They are now charging our credit card UGH you should take them off your site deplorable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1	Nice hotel for the price. Good location for getting around the San Diego area. Priced fairly. If your a couple and you can, get the king room. Nice pool area and bar lounge. Decent restaurant on site. Don't go for the fitness center.Dear Robert S.:Thank you for choosing the Best Western Seven Seas in San Diego for your recent stay! We are glad that you enjoyed our convenient location along with the value received. It is delightful knowing you appreciated our nice pool area, our infamous Zacks Bar and onsite restaurant, Seven Seas Caf, open from 6am-10pm serving breakfast, lunch, and dinner for our guests convenience. We are disappointed you did not care for our poolside workout room which contains a treadmill, elliptical, and stationary bike and apologize for not meeting with your expectations. It was our pleasure to provide you a great experience overall and look forward to welcoming you back. Most Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff
1	Absolutely perfect for my needs. I was attending a conference at the River Hotel (January 30-31, 2016). This was purely business so I wanted to minimize my stress by staying at (or near) the conference location by being able to fly in, then shuttle to from O'Hare airport and yet have plenty of dining options within walking distance of the hotel. The River Hotel found me a small room for a VERY reasonable (unbelievable) rate. Yes, I have read the reviews about the small rooms. This one was small. There was one queen sized bed, a desk, a pull out work station, and a full (shower) bath. Period. No extras. Yet it met MY needs (listed above) and my usual criteria of CLEAN, COMFORTABLE, and SAFE. The staff was EXCELLENT. I received friendly, efficient 5 star service for a 3 star price - from every single employee shift - both day night. I received free bottled water from a water station in the hallway. The vending machines were reasonable. My 17th floor small room, overlooked the river, the Trump Tower, the River Walk, and the city lights and sounds only added to the ambiance. I took the elevator down, crossed the lobby, took another elevator up to the conference (the two elevators - activated only by your room key card - ensured that the guest rooms were secure from being accessed by non guests). Even the conference was well prepped and attended by the hotel staff with fresh coffee, tea, and complimentary sodas that were refreshed at every break. I could continue... But suffice it to say that I was IMPRESSED. YES. My room was small. However, the break in price was compensation for this and (since I was only needing work space sleep) I did not NEED more. That said, if I am ever in Chicago again - for work or vacation - I WILL be back. NOTE: The hotel has an on site Italian Restaurant called Bella Bacinos. I will review it separately. For now, suffice it to say the food was DELICIOUS, the service was also 5 star, and the price - while not as inexpensive as I am accustomed to - was as affordable (more so) than comparable places nearby. Just be aware that a small is a medium... a medium is a large... etc. Yum!Dear John S,Thank you for choosing the River Hotel and for your detailed review of your experience.We are so proud of our staff services as well as our prime location and are delighted you were pleased as well. There is nothing I like more than sharing great comments with the team and I will certainly pass along your kind words.We are beyond thrilled to know we are your hotel of choice when visiting Chicago. We will look forward to welcoming you back soon!
0	I liked the beds but the smell of the hall ways were of arm pits. I had the suite on the 2nd floor. Every time some one walked on the third floor suite the entire room sounded like a stampede. My girls cried until the people went to sleep. The floor boards need to be redone. The staff were top class and very accommodating for us. I would stay there again but I would need to make sure I bring fabreeze and even more disinfectant spray.Please fix the leak in the ice room.My daughter liked the flower pictures on the guestroom walls.Dear 746tabithal,Thank you for your kind words regarding your stay at the Hawthorn Suites Dallas Park Central. We were glad to have you as our guest, and appreciate you taking the time to comment regarding your visit with us. We have gone over your review, and have address the issues you expressed concern with in the halls, and ordering new Ice Machines. As a hotel that was built in 1997, we are looking into ways we can minimize or soften any noise between floors, and are addressing with the hotel's ownership. We look forward to the opportunity to host you again the next time you are in the Dallas area. Thanks again for being our guest! Best regards, Charlie Westhoven Operations Manager Hawthorn Suites Dallas Park Central
1	Our stay near Mission Bay. This is a very nice motel near the park at Mission Bay, and just up the street, there are restaurants and some shopping. It is not with a lot of other development, as far as shopping malls or tourist endeavors, but right near I-5 and easy access to points of interest from there. It is a clean, quiet motel with pretty much everything you need. It also has a nice breakfast. It doesn't look spectacular from outside (not bad, just not fab), but it is clean and more than adequate.Good Afternoon,Thank you so much for taking the time to review our hotel. I'm so glad to hear you had an excellent stay! We do our best to provide you with excellent service, and your feedback is greatly appreciated.If we can be of assistance in the future, please don't hesitate to contact us anytime at 619.275.5700. Thanks again and hopefully we will see you next time you're in the San Diego area!Sincerely,MadisonGuest Services Agent
0	Unhappy. On arrival my husband and I needed to walk through the overgrown shrubbery to get to the front door and it had just rained. Needless to say our pants and shoes were wet.

0	a complaint against the night shift staff. his name is em. when i checked in, I told him many times that I will settle my bill with cash when checking out. he still charged my credit card.cockroaches were found in my room and outside the balcony.it is unbelievable that the room has no fridge.
1	Ideal Location. The location is fabulous! I looked at many of the hotels in the area right on the beach and most were about the same price as this one. I stayed with my family and the room was a great size especially after the hotel we came from in Santa Monica the previous night. I loved that we received breakfast so you have that option for something quick. The front desk service was great though the housekeeping was mediocre. The housekeeper tried getting in our room at 4:30 in the afternoon when my daughter was returning from the beach. The towels that they offer you for the beach and the pool are a joke, just a bit bigger than a hand towel. I would recommend bringing your own beach towels or you will need to purchase them when you get to the beach. They do offer you to use 2 beach towels that you can use but if you have a family you need more than that.Awesome feedback Heather! We are glad you chose to stay with us during your recent trip to San Diego. Youre right about most of the hotels in the area being about the same price. What sets us apart from the rest is our location as well as the fact that we offer a hearty complimentary continental breakfast and we offer the lowest price for secured parking in the area. We know that there are many options when staying in the area, but we strongly believe that we offer the best value for the price. Our housekeepers are usually cleaning rooms until 5:30 pm and we do try to get to our in house guests as quickly as we can. As for the beach towels you will be glad to hear that we recently upgraded to bigger, thicker towels for our guests to use at the pool and the beach. Thank you again for your feedback and we hope to see you again soon.
0	Disgusting. This hotel was beyond disgusting. The walls and ceiling were covered in mold and crumbling, there were gaping holes in the walls behind the fixtures, the bathtub was clogged and the faucet dripped. There were roaches crawling on the floors and walls in the bathroom. I will NEVER stay in a Days Inn ever again. The photos on line when I booked were very deceiving!
0	The Price is Right, But.... We had stayed at this Days Inn several years ago, and it has gone down hill since then. The breakfast was minimal, and the equipment in the fitness room did not work. The sink in the room was outside the bathroom, which was inconvenient. The room was clean, however, as was the corridor and hallway. The location is good with... More

We will be further investigating these claims to ensure that our staff gives 110 to each and every one of our guests. We greatly appreciate you bringing this to our attention and will work to make...More
1	I would stay again just because of the staff!!!. Everyone, from Rebecca at check-in, Deborah at check-out, the ladies during breakfast (I didn't get their names) and Carlos from maintenance were more than accommodating, super friendly and pleasant. They made sure we got what we needed and the adjoining rooms we needed were provided. The hotel itself was clean, quiet and modern, but the customer service is what made it perfect.Dear Guest Tina M, I would like to thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to write about your experience during your stay at the Hilton Garden inn Orlando Airport.

Sincerely,Alex BlancoGeneral Manager
1	VERY CLEAN BEST VIEW IN TOWN. This Hotel was very clean and very convenient within walking distance to all attractions and to the Cruise Piers. They are located directly across the street from the Space Needle so our view from our window was spectacular. Would recommend this to anyone visiting for a few days prior to going on a CRUISE. Also close to the Monorail that will take you into the city.reneeo784,On behalf of the staff, we truly appreciate you choosing the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown. Your comments about the cleanliness of the rooms and unbeatable location next to the iconic space needle and Seattle Center has the team proud to be members of the hotel. We hope you can join us again for your next trip into Seattle!Sarah Junge
1	Great, new hotel. This appeared to be a brand new hotel. It is extremely clean, bright and modern. They have a guest laundry on the 3rd floor that you can do yourelf. It costs 1.50 to wash and also to dry. The only complaint I had about that was there was no change machine in the laundry room, so I had to make a trip downstairs for that. They have a computer off the lobby where you can easily get on the internet for free. That was great to check emails, print out maps, etc. The breakfast there is included but ends at 9 a.m., which for vacationing families seemed very early. The breakfast was OK, but the same every day. The lobby is great, (you actually eat breakfast in the lobby area.) The workout room was very nice. It was large and actually had free weights, not just the usual treadmill. My son and I swam in the indoor pool one night and were the only ones in it. When you first walk in the pool area, it feels like a sauna, but is very nice to feel when you get out soaking wet. The location is right off 264, and it took us only about 10 minutes to get downtown and the same to get to the beach. There are really no restaurants real close by except for Ruby Tuesdays which is basically in the parking lot. You can walk there. The rooms are huge, plenty of room for a family to spread out. The furnishings are very pretty (artwork, lamps, curtains). They have music playing in the hallways near the elevators (which are very large as well.) Overall, this place was great.

1	Good Business Hotel. We stayed at this hotel since the convention we were going to was taking place at the hotel.All of the staff were extremely nice. The rooms were fine and the beds very comfortable.They have a small indoor pool, which I enjoyed early in the morning when it was empty. Though I didn't use the rest of the spa, it seemed to be clean and well equipped.The only thing that really bothered me is how they nickle and dimed you. 14.95 for internet (which we were lucky to get free as part of the convention rate) and 5 for a bottle of water that is out on the table with an invitation to refresh yourself... That said, when I checked in, the front desk offered me a cold drink, which was a nice touch.I am glad you enjoyed your visit at the Waverly and appreciate the feedback. We continue to monitor the pricing of amenities such as internet and water to ensure we remain competitve and will adjust as necessary. Thank you again for sharing your experience with us!
0	Just plain cheap. Sorry..guess you get what you pay for...but a: NO hangers in room b. 1 chair (2 adults) c. No continental breakfast d. No pool It was 100 degrees when we checked in...at least the air-cond worked. Internet pass word was long enough to be aq security code for an IBM missile..
0	Do Yourself a Favor and Stay At Another Hotel!. I booked my reservation on Motel 6's website. Upon arriving I requested to see my room before checking in. The hotel clerk refused my request and stated that it is the companys policy NOT to allow a person to see a room until after checking in first. (This should have been my first clue to leave.) The hotel clerk stated that after I have checked in that I could inspect the room. Furthermore, the hotel clerk stated that if the room was not satisfactory that I could leave without being charged. Both the room and the building were not satisfactory. It was 90 degrees in Atlanta on my visit and my room as well as the hallway in the building was hot and was not as comfortable as it should have been. The ice machine in the building hallway was in desperate need of repair because it was making an extremely loud humming sound that could be hear all the way down the corridor. The sheets on the bed needed to be changed. The hotel clerk refused to change the sheets and stated that if I wanted them changed that I had to remove the sheets myself. I have never heard of such nonsense. Lastly, the amount of money that the hotel wanted to charge me was 18.00 higher than the amount I was quoted when I made my reservation. Thus, with the bad conditions as well as the bad attitude of the staff, I left Motel 6 the SAME DAY and checked into the Marriott for just 7.00 more than what Motel 6 was charging per night. However, the Marriott gave me a free breakfast each morning compared to Motel 6 only serving coffee.The Motel 6 hotel clerk did not refund me the full amount of the charge to my credit card account. My credit card was charged for one night's stay. I wanted to get out of there so badly that I did not argue with the hotel clerk. I just disputed the charge with my credit card company and received an instant refund. So for the reasons cited above is why I would not recommend this hotel.
0	Pictures make it better than it seems. Unfortunately the place was pretty old, even though they had renovated it a few years ago. When we first got to our floor, we heard a mom who was pretty upset saying they were getting the out of there. Another guest returned to room 421 saying, Pack up, we're changing rooms! And yet another guest went to the front desk to say the floor was wet when they checked into room 103 or 105 they were moved to another room too. We had four people in our room but only two sets of towels and one set of toiletries. There wasn't a safe in the room, though that was not explained I had to call the front desk to inquire, as the information card had directions on how to use the in-room safe (there aren't safes in The Annex, but there is one for all to use at the front desk). The TV didn't work for awhile, so i also called the front desk for that, and Maintenance came up the outlet it was plugged into was busted, so they just plugged it into another one and then it worked. The pool was okay, though we came down for one final dip before checking out at 11:30, but it was being cleaned -- at 10 on a Friday morning! No warning or any indication that it was going to be cleaned then, and a few guests besides ourselves were also waiting. There was also no mention of the beach chairs, umbrellas and towels, which I knew we had from the LivingSocial deal that brought us there to begin with only after asking the Concierge and going to the beach at 5 p.m., did we realize the service was only available until 6 p.m. The bathroom was the part of the room that showed the most age, especially the tub and shower, which ran at very low pressure and the temperatures were incorrectly labeled hot was cold and cold was hot. Room temperature was consistently cold too I had it at 85 degrees and it was still freezing.Now for some positives: The hotel's diner-type restaurant, Teplitzsky's, was awesome. Melissa was our waitress both at dinner and breakfast the following morning, and she was attentive and efficient, as well as very personable and friendly (she was also the only waitress at dinner, and one of two at breakfast). When we asked for more shampoo and conditioner at the front desk, housekeeping ended up delivering three more sets of toiletries, which was a nice surprise, though they were haphazardly thrown onto the counter in our bathroom (the sink of which was peeling off). Any time I dealt with the Front Desk, they were courteous and helpful. I thought I had left a ring upstairs after checking out, and they reprogrammed my room key to allow me back in. The jacuzzi was AWESOME, I have to admit wish I had more time to enjoy it, but I was with an 8-year-old so we were mostly at the pool. The retro decor in the lobby and hallway between the lobby and pool/restaurant were nice, as well as the Sea Spa's, but otherwise The Annex was just old. Oh, and it was great to have free wifi.Overall, it was a decent stay, but I doubt I'll be back, except maybe to try another part of the hotel, just not The Annex again. Either way, I would definitely go back to Teplitzsky's it was delicious and a great value, and they let us sit for as long as we wanted, which was great.
0	Hotel not up to standards. The room was not clean my wife had to clean the tub in the bathroom,and around the toilet the carpets were dirty, the t.v. kept blanking out and the WiFi didn't work.
1	Excellent Hotel- Great location!. We spent two nights at Orchard Garden. Excellent location and helpful staff. Room was well appointed and very comfortable. Ricky at concierge is very friendly and extremely knowledgeable. Tai was also great. Be sure to ask for them. Looking forward to our return!!!Our number one priority is the satisfaction of our customers, so I'll be sure to pass along your compliments to Ricky and Tai -- I know they'll appreciate hearing them! As for the room, it's great that you felt your room was a comfortable place to come back to after a day out in the city. Looking forward to welcoming you back again soon!Safe traves home,Collins C., Front Office Manager
1	Family trip. Close to the French Quarter without the noise. Walked almost everywhere. Breakfast saved a lot of time cost. Parking was on site so less loading and packing up. Pool was quaint. The hotel has an elevator. Needs a microwave to keep the family happy. Thank you Guest for taking the time to review our hotel. We appreciate all the great comments to help our future guests know our prime location. Having on-site parking does help our guests with convenience and our pool and courtyard are a great place to sit back and relax after a long day of touring. I do apologize for not having microwaves in our rooms but we do always have our microwave available to guests in the breakfast area. Thank you again and we hope you come back and stay again soon.
1	This was a very good hotel, but I had ants all over my laptop that was set up on top of the work desk!. This was a very good hotel, but I had ants all over my laptop that was set up on top of the work desk inside my room. I arrived Sunday afternoon and checked in. The agent provided excellent customer service and gave me my room key. I immediately went upstairs and left my luggage, set up my laptop and left for a bite to eat. I returned back to my room around 7:30 to change and head downstairs to watch MNF at this nice sports bar grill. When I walked over to my laptop, I noticed very small ants al over my keyboard. I immediately contacted the FD and notified them of the issue. The agent immediately apologized and offered to change my room. So, I had to gather all my belongings and head back downstairs for the new keys (it would have been nice to have a bellman meet me at my new room) Overall, the property is nice with a descent mall nearby.Thank you for taking the time to give us this feedback, I will be sure to follow through with my team and ensure the issue you experienced (ants) has been addressed. I hope that we have the opportunity to have you back with us soon to ensure you have a perfect stay!
0	Worst Ever-ROACHES. We stayed for 2 weeks in December,2014. If I reviewed this prior, I had tried to be positive but due to the lack of follow up by the management at this location, Corporate after sending a certified letter and supposedly a Regional Manager that was to contact me I no longer care to be nice about our trip. The truth: I totally agree with anyone that says: ROACHES, ROACHES, ROACHES, ROACHES,ROACHES,ROACHES,ROACHES,ROACHES EVERYWHERE !!! In the kitchen(stove,frig), in the toilet, tub, sink, coming out of electrical outlets ! The critters have been there and although they sprayed (twice) it must be so infested throughout the place as obviously the problem still exists into 2015. This location caters to long-term live-ins rather than the vacationing or transit clientele. Our entire bill should have been refunded instead of a token portion. We were offered another room which we turned down not knowing what else we might run into. My husband I will never stay at this location again--we're done.Hi, Laura. We're sorry to hear that you, too, had some insect issues. We are an extended stay hotel and we do have guests who stay for long periods of time and that prepare food in their rooms but that is not an excuse for why this may have happened. We will continue to monitor for and treat any bugs we find and we appreciate you sharing with us that you had an issue.
0	Don't Book in Advance Here!!!. I had made reservations 4 months in advance and had it held on my card because I had a conference going on and booked guests for conference her. When I check my reservation I find out the manager of the hotel cancelled my hotels without warning because of an Indian wedding! I called in order to find out why and... More
1	Don't tell too many people or we won't be able to re-book!. The girls at the front desk were efficient when we arrived, but by the time we had booked in, the 11 or so behind us didn't look too happy as only 2 girls were there and the queue was growing very fast...Decor throughout the main part of the hotel is dated, but well maintained and clean. The motel style units looked well worn out, but we were pleasantly surprised at the fresh decor and up market linens and drapes in our room, which was spotlessly clean and cleaned every day we stayed there.The pool and spa pools are beautiful. I didn't use the fitness room as looked a bit 'testosterone laden' with too many men working out for me, but the pool was clean and warm.It's in a strange situation on 'the Hotel Circle' which literally is a circular route of hotels with an elevated highway running alongside them, about 3-4 miles from downtown, so there is a bit of traffic noise, but Downtown hotels are ALL on the flight path of either the Navy airstrip or the international airport! If you are a light sleeper, ask for rooms in the 210-224's as these are quietest and not poolside either. We slept okay.
1	The Right Location and the Right Price. Lodging is expensive in New Orleans, but this place offers everything at a reasonable price. It's located on the edge of the French Quarter, so you can be in the action on Bourbon Street after a five minute walk. And when it's time to come home, you can get away from the action to relax in the peace and quiet of your hotel room. We were delighted to get upgraded to a suite, but really did not spend much time in the room taking advantage of the hot tub or other amenities. There is so much to see and do in town and the tour buses will pick up visitors right at the front door of the hotel. A nice bar is available for a leisurely drink and a free breakfast is offered featuring a variety of the usual fare. Parking is hard to come by in town, but it's available on site for hotel guests (for a nightly fee). The staff is exceptional, so just let them know if you have any questions about the area or need some recommendations.
1	Walking Distance to the Washington State Convention Center. There are two big reason I stayed at this hotel. First that it was walking distance to the Washington State Convention Center. However there was a very step hill going down up before arriving there. Need to be in somewhat of good shape. Second was the price was the best for the location to the near the convention center. The trade off for the price, is this is an older hotel. The bathroom is very small, with a small door way. The room I had was a good size, and had a kitchenette. The room was very clean internet was free. The only problem I had with the room was the refrigerator was leaking on the floor, which made the room smell odd on the second day, and carpet wet. I should told the management.I will probably stay there again again next year, because of the price location.Hi Traveler - Thanks so much for your kind review. We always enjoy our convention guests and hope you enjoyed Seattle during your stay! Please come back and visit us again soon! Safe travels!
0	Expected more.. What a disappointing stay- fell far below expectations, which weren't so high to begin with. The only thing this hotel has going for it is the excellent location. Otherwise, I found the front desk to be mostly unprofessional (with a few exceptions) and a little too casual.The room was comfortable and generally fine, in terms of condition, apart from the surprising lack of a safe! Having to store valuables with the reception felt inconvenient and outdated. The room was also a bit noisy due to a parking garage across the street that sounded a small siren noise every time a vehicle exited. Surely the hotel can negotiate this to be removed or install better noise insulation on that side of the buildingBut my biggest beef was the breakfast, which was simply mediocre at best and unreliable from one day to the next. Two of the three mornings, there was no fresh fruit to be had... and there was generally no healthy food to be found. The overall quality of the food reminded me of a school cafeteria and was very limited in choice.
0	Not Great. We stayed there one night in October. When we arrived the person at the desk was very friendly helped us get our luggage to our room. The bad though outweighed the good. We had booked a king and they sold out of those so we had 2 queens. The room was clean but was very tired looking. The new... More
0	LIpstick on a PIg. While the outside is what draws in the crowd, the restaurants and snazzy bars keep the walkers inside, once you put that key card into the door, and go rest to relax, you quickly realize the executive suite that you booked, is nothing more than a run down Motel. Taking away from the fact my reservation was for a King,... More
1	Great value and helpful staff.. Last weekend I traveled to San Diego for a memorial service. From the time I made the reservation with Len Regan until I checked out early Monday morning, I was treated like a valued customer. Len upgraded me to a suite without any prompting on my part. He provided excellent, concise directions to public transportation as well as provided a coupon for a Trolley Tour of the city. The Lamplighter, while an older hotel, is very well maintained and super clean. It's third generation American family owned. The landscaping is lush, the breakfast is more than a continental and very tasty. The team spirit among the employees and staff was most noticeable. I observed an array of elderly folks who seem to be frequent guests and discovered many have been coming for two to three month stays for many years. There are good restaurants within walking distance. All in all, I would highly recommend this Best Western.
1	Fabulous, eccentric and downright wonderful.. I cannot express enough how much I love this place. I was a little hesitant because of some of the reviews, but the price point was perfect so I figured I didn't have anything to lose.As soon as I walked in, I knew I had made the right choice. Sleek and modern decor combined with incredibly friendly service made me feel immediately at ease. I booked the Executive King sized room and requested a room NOT facing Geary so that I could enjoy some quiet time. It's 312 sq feet, which was plenty of space. Yes, the bathroom is small, but I don't require much room. Surprisingly, in spite of others saying the dark grey paint made the rooms dim, my room was incredibly bright (I arrived at 3:00 pm). The bed is quite possibly the most comfortable hotel bed I've been in and the bedding was so soft and luxurious. I felt like I could lay in bed all day.You have to remember that this is a boutique hotel that was beautifully sprung from an old apartment building. So yes, the floors creak, and you can hear people outside your door. If your style lends itself to a traditionally upscale hotel, this may not be the place for you. If you like hip, modern, eccentric styles, Hotel Diva is perfect.Hello Pamcakes1979,Thank you for sharing your experience at Hotel Diva with Trip Advisor. We truly appreciate your kind words. I hope you had the chance to enjoy the complimentary amenities we offer: wifi, busines center, fitness center, tea lounge, Perrier lobby water service and our sake hour from 5 to 7pm. We look forward to welcoming you back at Hotel Diva.Best regards,Virgil LopezHotel Manager
1	Good option in great location. PROS:-This is a fantastic location near Union Square with easy walking distance to the Ferry Building, Financial District, SOMA, and Civic Center. -The lobby and rooms are comfortably decorated and noise was not an issue.-Front Desk will store luggage and most of the clerks are very friendlyCONS:-Valet takes at least 30 minutes-No pour it yourself wine reception, must go to the bar and request your complimentary glassDear climbandtravel,Thank you for your feedback - we do appreciate it. I'm glad to hear you enjoyed our location, comfortable setting, and a free glass of wine. It typically takes 15-20 minutes to retrieve your vehicle, but at times of high volume and heavy street traffic, it can take longer. We're constantly working with our valet company to make this process as efficient as possible, so I thank you for your comments. Please come see us again soon! Regards,Eric
1	About 10 miles from interstate, but really quaint.. We were on the road, and booked this right before midnight. Really the only hotel available at that time. Quaint hotel in an adorable town, but we had a truck with 18 foot trailer - no parking! We parked 3 blocks away on the street! No problems! The hotel has a few bars and there was defiantly some parting going on, but you could not hear it from our room! Hotel had elevator, but was not working at that time and we had to climb one big set of steps! Room was clean but 'old' and charming! Think we had a 'spirit' that messed with my night lite, but was 'friendly'! Nice breakfast in the AM - coffee was amazing! Food was nicely prepared and fresh! Desk clerk at midnight was very nice and accommodating (forgot his name!) sorry! Would love to come back to 'explore' this town and would defiantly stay here again!
1	Friendly, Clean. Due to airline difficulties I ended up in Orlando for one night. Room was booked same day. Arrived hungry, frustrated and tired. Check in was friendly and quick. Room was clean. Ate a quick meal at the grill, chef was friendly, food was fresh. Bartender pleasant. Bed comfortable. I always sleep with earplugs so noise wasn't an issue. I did hear planes when I awoke early the next morning. The shuttle driver was a pleasure to speak with on my ride to the airport. Overall I was very pleased. It was a pleasant respite from an otherwise stressful day. We appreciate you taking the time to write a wonderful review about your recent visit to the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport. I was sorry to read that your flight was cancelled, as it can be very annoying to find rooms at the last minute and be unsure as to what to expect when you arrive. I am glad that we were able to turn this situation into a pleasant experience. We work hard to keep our facilities clean for our guests and always provide excellent service with a smile. I will share your gracious feedback with my team, especially with my desk team and bartenders. Thanks for being our guest, and we would love to welcome you back, under better circumstances, the next time that you visit Orlando. Sincerely,Michael GoldwasserGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport
0	DIRTY!!. I don't ask very much more from a hotel than to have clean rooms, and for a hotel that is new the maintenance obviously lacks. The bathroom had hair from previous people. The bedskirt and in between beds had so much dust and dirt and even old chewing gum wrappers, it was obvious that it had never been cleaned. The carpet hadn't been vacuumed and the carpet in corridor was stained and dirty. It was very dissapointing but it was too late when we realised it, it all seemed okay at first sight. The hotel also overlooks I4 which I didn't care for.
1	Great location, Nice hotel.. The hotel is located in an excellent location, central for walking everywhere. The front desk staff were pleasant, although not terribly knowledgable and we had to ask for information regarding the hotel rather than being offered information about internet access, gym, etc. The rooms are not the biggest, but they are clean and decently appointed. The bathrooms are spacious. The bed is very comfortable with fluffy duvet and plenty of pillows. We've stayed here once before and would definitely stay at this hotel again. It's not fancy but it's clean, comfortable, and a great deal for the price.
1	We had a good stay. We had a good stay. The location is a little bit away from the French Quarter. I would have liked to be just a little closer for safe walking, but we were fine . There are always taxi cabs right outside. The pool was nice and refreshing . A nice courtyard to sit at. The breakfast was good. It was clean. A little dreary but good for the price and location. Inside parking for a price 21 dollars . Limited though , on a first come basis . No microwave in room , but one in lobby to use. Frig in room and a coffee pot . Bar in the lobby. Good air conditioning! We would stay again if passing this way again.
1	Plush hotel conveniently located by the convention center downtown.. The hotel is perfectly located downtown, near the fish market and other tourist attractions. It is next to the convention center, and a block from a major public transit hub (which connects to the airport as well as other areas.)The rooms are large, clean, and luxurious. The bathroom is larger than a double hotel room I stayed in in Denmark, and has a large soaking tub as well as a comfortable shower stall. The only oddity is that the sink seems to either produce warm water or cool water randomly, with little relationship to which tap I turn.The bed is comfortable, and the desk is spacious. There are power outlets in ask the places you'd want them. The wifi seems stable and reasonably fast.The staff have been helpful and pleasant. Check in was easy, and they have given me helpful advice getting around town.This is not a cheap hotel, but i am happy to be here.
1	Family stay. This hotel staff were all very friendly helpful--from front desk to breakfast room and cleaning staff. The rooms were clean met our expectations given price point. The pool area is nice. We were impressed with the beautiful flowers.Dear Joyce, Thank you for taking the time to share your review with our TripAdvisor community.

1	Central and fun place to stay in Boston.. Bad: The only draw back is the noise at night from th people coming in and out of the lounge and adjacent nightclub. Though it didn't bother us personally. Good: I loved how central the location was. The hotel is in the theatre district. We walked to the harbour as well as Shopping and all the parks around us. After a long day of walking around we enjoyed A massage at the Bliss spa. We also enjoyed having a drink at the lounge before going to bed. It was a great experience for us. It might be too noisy for people who want peace and quite. I also had the best sleep in those beds. I would recommend staying at the W Boston.
0	Insects. I guess they don't care about the little critters that creep around the room. We informed the front desk and all they said was, hum. We usually have the rooms sprayed! Found two centipedes and spiders crawling around.
1	Well located hotel, close enough to walk to everything and experience Honululu. This hotel offers everything you need for a seaside stay without the huge crowds at the other hotels. A 2 minute walk to the hotel strip, it's location was top notch and the staff so friendly and helpful.Aloha Ian402014,Thank you for staying with us! We are so happy that our top notch location as well as our friendly and helpful staff exceeded your expectations. It was our absolute pleasure to accommodate you and yours during your Hawaiian holiday. We appreciate your 5 star review and please come see us again. Happy travels!Mahalo,Jerome YapchingAssistant Front Office Manager
0	Not good, disapointing. Decided to stay here on the spur of the moment. Not worth what we paid. It was cleanish, but extremely outdated. I think original dcor from 1967. The bathroom sink looked like an airplane sink. TV Stand, the drawers would not stay closed and there was a bottle cap and folded up paper under one leg to try to make it level. Bed not very comfortable. No windows in the room we where in. The room door barely opened and closed. If all you are looking for is a place to sleep off a hangover and don't care about anything else it would be ok. Not a romantic stay. I wont stay there again
1	Nice Solid HGI. This Hilton Garden Inn is well managed, clean, and close to the airport. In fact it is so close airport it is directly under one of the runway approaches - which is very cool if you like plane-spotting. That being said the noise from landing aircraft was minimal inside the hotel. Good bar and friendly bartender. Breakfast was good and nice attentive servers. The bed was VERY comfortable and room was nicely appointed.Thank you for choosing the HIlton Garden Inn Miami Airport West for your stay in Miami.We appreciate you taking the time to share your review on this site and we lookforward to welcome you back.Kind regards,Amanda GrahamFront Office Manager
0	Business Hotel, Not for family-environment hotel. I spent two nights at the Metro Points Hotel. The Hotel Guests was somewhat in some of term is seemed to be helpful. The reasons I took points off because Breakfast Foods were awful. The chef used pre-packages on most of the buffet foods. The hospitality of the service was very negative. 10 charged for using microwaves is ridiculous! There is no another way to heating up my foods from take-out place. Not the best family hotel to book it. Probably more for last minute business trip. .
0	Wouldn't recommend.. 1st the air didn't work. 2nd the bolt lock didn't work. 3rd there is a very sickly looking boy cat who someone should take to the vet, they said it has lived there 10 yrs and its super skinny, its skin is dry and bumpy and its missing hair. The rooms were dirty, pub on the toliet seat, black specks of something on the sheets. One of the people in my group burned their hand on the waffle maker and the front desk didn't have a first aid kit, told me to go to gas station next door. Wouldn't recommend it.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for your constructive feedback. Our intent is to give great quality at minimal cost to you our valued guest. We ask that you please bare with us as we continue to improve the quality of our hotel while we are undergoing renovations. Our ultimate goal is to provide all of our guests with enjoyable, and memorable stays! So we look forward to having an opportunity to make your next stay just that! Thank you for your patience once again and we hope to see you soon.
1	We LOVED The Diva!. Everything about the hotel was great! The location, our rooms, the staff, the rate -- it was all fabulous! :) We came for a concert and had previously booked at three other hotels but went with The Diva due to it's prime location and we couldn't have been happier.They offered a AAA rate and their junior suite was perfect for the three of us. The murphy bed was sooo much better than a foldout or rollaway would've been. I personally loved the file cabinets repurposed as a bureau and the mini fridge in the room was great for left overs as well. There were plenty of hangers in the closet, the HVAC all worked lovely without any noise and the televisions worked great as well.I've traveled the world over and stayed in all different qualities of hotels, motels, B Bs and inns and The Diva had everything we needed.Parking wasn't a problem and with unlimited in and out privileges it worked out great for us. I would definitely recommend The Diva to anyone wanting to stay in downtown San Francisco and I will absolutely stay there again the next time I am in the city by the bay.If there was one thing criticism it was that the sink in my room didn't have a stopper or anything to stop something from falling down the drain. That didn't happen, but looking at the hair caught down in there was unpleasant to look at and nasty to think about. I know it's a pain but staff should really keep that clear. Other than that it was perfect! :)
0	Disgusting!!!!!!. We stopped in here for a night's stay due to the fact they had a vacancy. We had already been in the area for 2 nights but our hotel was already booked when we wanted to extend our stay! We stopped in the office to check the rate for the night and the gentleman who I think is the owner... More
0	get what you pay for. bad water pressure in shower, found cockroach in room, breakfast was terrible....
0	No Pool on a Saturday. Wasn't impressed with anything beautiful bldg on the outside but the staff inside needs a lot of work unfriendly not knowledgeable at all did a early check in room wasn't ready C the front desk person made no eye contact no smile ok we walk to the mall until the room was ready in a hr ok I was also caught off guard by all the fees they don't tell you online when you reserve it but ok we're already here finally checked in then the elevators where down some emergency not sure what it was but after a long flight and day we just wanted to relax the room had a bad stinch mildew because I have asthma and when there's mold around it sets my asthma off thank goodness I had my inhaler the room was basic dated no trash can liners not enough towels n washcloths the water didn't drain out after taking a shower fitness center and pool was great I also ask several staff members about the amenities and services their answer exactly 3rd floor so the last person I ask I said look this hotel has 30 plus floors and the only place I can get a Pepsi is in the hotel lobby this can't be true then the front desk person told me to go online to see what the hotel offers and amenities oh ok so since I made a trip to the front desk you don't know what's in your hotel point taken I told her I will never stay here again and I've stayed at other Marriott Marquis downtown Atlanta and their staff was friendly knowledgeable had information about the amenities and services this one by far is the worst I will never recommend or come back here I will go back downtown if your into the Mall and shopping great location other then that overpriced bad serviceI very sorry for your disappointment in our hotel. We pride ourselves in exceeding our guests expectations, our attention to detail and our service levels. Obviously we failed you and I would like to express my sincerest apology. I would love to talk to you directly regarding your stay. Please feel free to contact me if your time permits. I do hope that you will give us the opportunity to regain your trust and confidence.
1	Beware of the locked parking lot. Apparently the parking lot is locked at 7 PM. You would not know this unless it was locked and you were looking at the sign on the locked gate. I had an early AM (5:30) checkout after a one night stay for an early flight. The desk clerk did not tell me the gate was locked. As I was loading the luggage in the car, the security guard walked by and did not tell me the gate was locked. When I got to the gate, I found it locked and had to run around the hotel as I had no key to get in the back and then had to wait for the security guard to drive over to unlock the gate.
1	Two night stay awaiting Alaska Cruise. My family I stayed two nights at the Inn at Virginia Mason. We had 3 rooms. The Inn was very old and part of a hospital. Our rooms were very clean comfortable. When looking for 3 rooms in late May for two nights, the Inn provided me with the best prices I could find in Seattle. If when I travel to Seattle again, I will more than likely stay at the Inn at Virginia Mason again. Hi Jonathan - Thank you for your kind comments on your stay with us before your cruise. We are so happy to hear that the price was right and the rooms were clean and comfy. We look forward to the opportunity of welcoming you again in the future. Until then, safe travels!
1	Comfy!. Very nice hotel! The employees were all very helpful, the rooms were very comfortable and clean, and everything in the rooms, the pool, and the lobby looked clean and up to date. The rates were really good and the location is the perfect driving distance from all the restaurants and stores. This hotel definitely aided in providing us with a positive Key West experience. The only negative thing that I have to say is about the the breakfast. There was no fruit! The only thing they had fruit wise were oranges. It would have been nice if they had fruits like bananas and apples paired up with those oranges. Other than that everything else was A plus.Dear natalianieves22,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel and providing your feedback. We are Happy that you had a Positive Key West Experience, and enjoyed your stay with us. Also thank you for letting me know about the Fruit. We do usually have Bananas as well as cut fruit on the buffet and I will be looking into it so it doesn't happen again. We hope to see you back in Key West again very soon.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager
1	Oasis in the Valley. First time guest at this very pleasant hotel. Grounds are well manicured and nicely layed out. Rooms are spacious and comfortable with a trendy decor. Bathrooms a little dated, but very clean. I usually stay at BW Plus hotels, but this property offered all the amenties I've received in the Plus hotels in a great location for my business trip at an attractive rate. Close to mall, restaurants Quallcom Stadium. Close enough to the airport, without the airport noise. Multiple 2 story walk up buildings. Recommend rooms on the first floor, although car lights could shine into the room if your drapes are open. Staff was friendly, courteous and very professional.
0	Room smelled of smoke Very basic motel. Remodeling now. No elevator. Far from buses.. This Rodeway Inn was recently converted from a TLC. For some reason the people who worked there wouldn't admit it had been a very recent change. The lobby has been retiled and the halls are being repainted. Breakfast was very basic-although a it included a waffle machine. The whole hotel is supposed to be non-smoking, but we were uncomfortable because... More
0	Lipstick on a Pig. We had high hopes for this place and were sorely disappointed. The bathrooms are TINY which is ridiculous as there are two closets so why when the did the rehab didn't they widen the bathroom into the closet The shower is 2 feet wide and you need to stand at an angle to the sink to use it because there is no room. The toilet is wedged between the sink and shower.There is only a desk chair, no comfortable seating in the room. I had a decent street view but the window was painted shut.Despite being in the Tenderloin I like the location, easy access for the Ubers and far less touristy than Union Square, there is a great breakfast place across the street called Farm:Table. But all in all I would suggest a full service Marriott nearby for an extra 20Frederico1st - We will like to sincerely apologize about the inconvenience you faced during your recent visit and we are also disappointed that you did not enjoy your stay. We will certain address your concerns with our ownership. Thank you for staying with us.
0	Not Again. Hotel is dated and needs updating. Free continental breakfast was a disappointment. Will not stay here again.
0	Absolute last resort. First of all, I'll warn you that there are no refunds, no exceptions. Power went out and a guy who just purchased a room 5 mins prior was denied a refund when we were all informed it could be up to two days before it was turned back on. The owners of this hotel are an Indian family, and I... More
1	Great location, great hotel!. We had a great stay at Best Western Mission Bay. It is located right off the highway and in a great central location whether you plan to visit Mission Beach/Bay Area, downtown, or even Coronado or La Jolla. The front desk was very friendly and our room was super clean and comfortable!Good Afternoon,Thank you for sharing your trip experience here at the Best Western Mission Bay. I am glad you were happy with our accommodations and staff. Thank you for your compliments to our location, just within walking distance to Mission Bay and five minutes away from Sea World. Should you return to San Diego area, please feel free to contact me directly for all your reservation needs. You can reach me at 619-275-5700 ext 393 or Lpradohotelpros.bizHave a wonderful week!Leidy PradoFront Office Manager
0	Not Happy. the restaurant was overpriced and not very good. The wall of mirrors in the rooms is awkward when you are sharing a room with your mother, although I think it would have been weird if it had been my husband and I too. The bottles of water in the room for 2.50 a bottle seemed a bit much since the next best western offered a complimentary bottle of water for their guests. With the price I paid for the room, for them to charge for water we thought it was ridiculous. Plus I stayed at a lot of hotels on this trip and this was the first one to charge a 75 dollar hold for the room in case we caused damages. We drove to san diego from Portland Or, because we couldnt afford to fly we had a credit card with just enough money on it for the room, which we had to get because my brother was graduating from Boot camp, and we had to scramble to find a card to put the money on which took out of our gas money. The king sized bed was actually a queen and the queen beds were double beds. There was hair in my bed the first night and part of a sticky note the second night. The shuttle driver the first night was kind of a jerk he made everyone get on the first shuttle so he didnt have to make a second trip so people were standing and crouching in the aisle and then he told everyone if they can drive they should so they dont have to be on the shuttle. Maui was a great driver but we did not like this other guy. I also had to get my key reactivated 3 times because it stopped working. I will be letting the Marine admins that recommend this hotel to visiting families about this stay.
1	Location, Ambiance and Great views. Recently, enjoyed with my family and grandchildren 3 nights at this quaint beautiful centrally located hotel. Our room was beautiful and although facing the front of the property, we had a beautiful view of the mountains. The flower boxes were so beautiful hanging on the small patio opening of our room. Hummingbirds flew on the window boxes taking nectar from the petals. It was very wonderful to see. The rooms are large and all accommodations were much like a 5+ hotel. Beautifully decorated we were very pleased with our rooms. We especially enjoyed the valet parking and Eric who was so helpful. The check in process was easy and accommodated our early check-in wishes. The European style breakfast was enjoyable with plenty of food to fill you up for a early day of shopping sight seeing and photo opportunity. Walk literally out the door and you are welcomed by the abundance of shopping and restaurants. We will most certainly book this hotel again.
1	Great getaway!. The hotel was great and the staff were very accommodating. The pool and room were very well maintained. They had put us though in a room right near the pool and was a bit loud at times, especially on Sundays at the pool party. Would recommend requesting a more secluded room if you are looking for a more chill time. Overall, I would recommend this place. The pool has a nice bar and the restaurant at the hotel is delicious.Thank you for your review and I am sorry that your room was a bit loud. Some of our guest like to be in the middle of it all. Please be sure to request a more private/quiet room on your next visit.
0	Overcharged. They double-charged us for valet parking. For 2 nights we paid over 260 and they have yet to reimburse us. Expect to wait over 45 minutes to have your car fetched from the valet and pre-arrange for them to retrieve it before check-out.
1	Great place to stay on Seattle. The Grand Hyatt Seattle is a great place to stay when visiting Seattle. The light rail goes from the airport to west lake station, just 2 blocks from the hotel. Given Seattle's terrible highway traffic, having a hotel that can be easily reached for a fee of 3.00 on the light rail is a huge plus. The hotel is within easy walking distance of all of the tourist sites, museums, cruise ship and ferry docks, as well as many bars and restaurants. If you are planning on spending all of your time in downtown, you will not need a car if you stay here. If you decide to venture out of the city, there is a Hertz car rental office located in the hotel parking garage. The hotel itself is very nice. The rooms are spacious, clean, and modern. The staff is very helpful and eager to make sure that your stay is stress free. If it happens to be raining, be sure to ask the front desk for an umbrella. They provide complementary sturdy and large umbrellas for guest use. We asked for a room with a view of the water. We had a room on the 25th floor that looked straight down Pine street to the famous Public Market sign. The view of Puget Sound was fantastic. I highly recommend this hotel.
1	Our team strives to provide service that makes every guest feel at home. I got a 'thank you for staying with us' email with the above words in it. On my last trip I had just left the Suncoast and was talking to a slot attendent at the Mirage who also likes the Suncoast. He asked why I liked it so much and I said I did not know - now I know - I feel so comfortable here. I stay at the Suncoast for 2-3days every 2months as part of a longer10-11 day holiday. It is not the Strip but it is still a nice casino - a locals casino with bowling, a cinema and bingo hall. But it also has a conference centre / banuet hall. You do not look out over the Strip but you can look out over a golf course and their nice pool area. When I stay on the Strip I actually ask for a Mountain View room - rather than a view of McDonalds and Walgreens! Even though I am a semi regular I am treated as a local. If I room charge I do not need to show ID - that's OK - we know you. The Cocktail waitresses even remember what I like to drink. They like my English accent! I had changed the dates of mt stay and the receptionist spotted that my dining credit had not been carried over so she corrected that. They now have sofas for the rest of your party can rest while you sign-in. The area is smoke-free - for those not used to casinos but I still say I do not recognise the casino as being smokey. I like the buffet for breakfast (8.50 inc tax) but then Du-Pars for Dinner where I can sit and have the food brought to me. The wine is 5 a glass 4-7pm - a nice end to the day. I'm interested in trying PengZu. The menu is on the Suncoast website and has some interesting dishes that attract this 61yo white guy. For burgers etc they have The Game sportsbar or the bowling alley snack bar - I have enjoyed both. Some days I do not feel hungary but I am tired so I get a Subway and a bottle of wine from the Gift shop (Glen Ellen Cabenet 4) and retire to my room. There is a refrigerator in the room. Du-Pars do the room service but the menu was missing from my room the last two trips. At some hotels that would be an issue but not at the Suncoast. My next trip will be in May with a suite at NYNY, a room at the Suncoast and a suite at the Mirage. I have asked for a Tuscany suite on eStandby. If I do not get it I will be happy with my 550sqft Suncoast room with floor to ceiling windows. I can get a bus from outside NYNY (or the airport) to the Suncoast for 2 - the Westcliffe Express (WAX). The bus can take me back to the Strip and somedays it has taken me to Downtown to visit the Suncoast's sister properties.Awesome! We love to see five-star experiences. We are glad our mission is fulfill through you experience with us! Thank you for visiting us! See you again, next time!
0	Won't stay here again.. Only staff that was friendly was the evening desk person. The Red Lion Inn Suites Manager McMinnville, OR is very VERY rude! Crystal!! We attempted to cancel our second night due to changes in our travel plans. A few hours after we checked in we were told checking out a day early was no problem so we made a reservation at another hotel a few hours further south in OR. When we went to check out we were told by Crystal that we would not be getting a refund for the second night because we were a pre-pay. She insisted that it was Expedia that would not permit the refund. She also said it was hotel policy that since it was a prepay the second night could not be refunded!! I called Expedia, and they tried to get the Crystal to release us from the second night and they were told NO, and Expedia had no choice but to honor the hotel policy. So now we had two hotel reservations. Fortunately Expedia was able to cancel the reservation we had made at the other hotel (without penalty). We later checked the hotel policy on-line and it did not say anything regarding no refund for cancelling a second night, only first night or no shows!! We brought this to Crystals attention, and she just said hmmm, Ill check into that. No apologies, no managerial flexibility in resolving our customer dissatisfaction, and she talked to us as if we were children. Red Lion did not care about our needs, only about selling out the hotel!! We doubt we will never stay at another Red Lion.
1	Good hotel, noisy lifts. We enjoyed our stay here at the start of August. The room was spacious and had nice modern touches like lots of USB charging points, fast wifi, docking stations and the likes. The fridge was also useful. I'd definitely stay here again.The only downside was that our room was directly opposite the elevator. It pings twice every time the doors open which is extremely irritating when trying to sleep. (Of course, there is no option to take the stairs, it's lift or nothing, so it's in use all the time.) The hotel were happy to move us to another room which was near a lift that was out of order. Sadly it started working on one of the mornings so we still got disturbed. It wouldn't out me off staying here though.It's close to Fisherman's Wharf which may or may not suit. Accessible from SFO by BART and then on to F-line. We took an Uber back to SFO though and it only cost 10 more for two of us. Much easier.
0	Crack House Living. When we first got to the Hotel I was parallel parking and A bum try to pretend to get hit by me. Then asked me for money. Then we checked in an that was painless. We got to our room and I felt like I was in a crack house. Our reservation said a balcony which there was not. The windows were so high that you couldn't see out side unless you stood on a chair. It felt like we were in a dungeon but we were on the second floor. No fridge ,no safe. It looked like someone stole the fridge.
0	entering at own risk !!. late arrival....spent about 5 min in the room. Dirty towels and bed sheets. Found 2 bugs in the so called bathroom. TV from the 70*s and a carpet where you would prefer to keep you shoes on. Thankfully the clerk gave us our money back, as he could see the bugs himself. When we left again....saw notice from a public... More
0	Sucks, Nosy Staff. Horrible
0	Sketchy Performance and too many dogs, disappointing snacks but still free wine, except Sunday.. We showed up early and expected to wait. We had driven 500 mi. so a couple of hours wait for our room, reserved a week prior, was no problem. The receptionist assured us that he would try to speed up the cleaning process and would let us know when our room was available. That didn't happen. I noticed that generally... More
1	Great Stay at Hotel Allegro. Great centrally located hotel, but the highlight is the customer service. Shoutout to Caitlin from the concierge team, super helpful before my arrival. Every team member was super helpful and the room was well appointed. Clean and great bathroom amenities. There is construction happening, but did not experience any noise during my stay. They were proactive and placed a letter and ear plugs in the room to help. Great to see a hotel try to get ahead of an opportunity outside of their control. Another added bonus was the complimentary coffee station the lobby each morning, simple and nice touch. Very happy with this stay and will return again when heading back to Chicago. Thank you for taking the time to complete this review! The Allegro is fortunate to have such a friendly and helpful staff to accommodate guests. We really appreciate your comments about the construction, as well. We are constantly thinking of new ways to ensure that this city-mandated project does not negatively impact the guest experience we provide. If your travels bring you back to the city, we hope to welcome you back!
0	Bad Night's Sleep. The HVAC did not work properly leading to both of us having a restless night's sleep. The location was great and the room and layout were also ideal. It is a beautifyl new hotel however, I always sleep through the night even when away from home, and especially after walking over 3 miles at Epcot that day. Was unable to get comfortable, even though I brought my own pillows too. Checked out after one night's stay so would not have another restless night. Expressed our disappointment to the front desk and no alternative was offered, such as moving to another room, or fixing the unit in the existing room. Also, there was no mention of the 100 satsifaction guarantee, so I did pay for the one night.Dear Gary A,I would like to first take this opportunity to apologize for the late reply and to also express my sincerest apologies for not following through on our 100 Hampton guarantee with you during the time of your stay. We ensure all of our guests who come to our property, If you're not satisfied, we don't expect you to pay. I am thoroughly disappointed that we were not able to exhaust another alternative or fix the problem immediately and make your stay more comfortable. I would love to help make this right. If you would so kindly, please send me an email with your full name and the night of your stay at nickhamptonorlando.com so we can take care of you.
0	Pet friendly....kind of. Came here this past week with the kids and dog. Booked a pet friendly room on 2 different nights. There was a nice small dog bed and dishes in the closet for you to use during your stay. If your pet is more than 20 lbs the bed will probably be too small. There is a 25.00 extra charge per... More
0	Worst hotel ever in AC. Our stay was very bad . It started off with waiting to check in for an hour. Then when we got to our room our bed sheets had a whole in it and not to mention our Toilet would not flush . When I went down to complain about it the front deal receptionist had an attitude . For Over 200 a night I would expect to be treated better and the hotel to be updated . I would never ever say here again .
0	You get what you pay for. We paid for a cheap room and we got it. The place seemed kind of sketchy. Had my husband not had a concealed license and been carrying his gun we probably wouldn't of stayed here. We only needed one night to sleep. We did check the beds first and slept fine. We would not go back to this motel though.
0	Awful!!!. Stayed there for a few days while working in Orangeburg, SC. The place is a dump. No mini fridge, microwave, half the lights didn't work, roach sighting at least a few times a day, etc., the list can go on and on. Was told by Front Desk staff that the hotel has been foreclosed on, and is now bank owned,... More
0	Don't do it. They quoted me 83/night the rate was above the per diem. The room was very old and outdated with a horrible air conditioning unit. The bathroom was also bad. The front desk was rude and not friendly.the only thing good about the hotel was the lobby. Breakfast was not included either. SmhFirst of all, thank you for taking the time to leave your comments regarding your recent stay with us. I'm sorry to hear that you did not have a positive experience. We always try to do everything that we can to ensure a positive stay, and I apologize that your expectations were not met. Thank you again for your review, as it will help us to better our property for the future. We hope you'll stay with us again the next time you're in town!Best regards,
0	Excellent place to stay...if you are desperate!. Lets see...where to begin. Perhaps it was the dust storm created on a windy day by the unpaved lot next door that created a scene from the Grapes of Wrath as the Joads outran a duststorm that literally almost obliterated the hotel. Perhaps it was the bathroom, urine smell that greeted you as you entered the lobby the 1970s carpets,... More
1	Great Place away from Noisy strip. I stayed here mid May for a large planned Birthday Party. I arrived at 2:00 pm for a room which I had pre-paid for and they were out of rooms so they can me an upgrade to a 10th Floor Penthouse suite at no extra cost, it was amazing and very large.I had come a few years later for a weekend function but stayed next door at the Marriott. Suncoast is almost as nice but far cheaper.Sunday Brunch was OK but a good deal for 19.00 ( you get a discount at all restaurants if you get their free membership card). I didn't try other restaurants. They are building a lot of Shops and restaurants across the street.I like the area as well, quiet and close to Red Rock Canyon.
1	Highly enjoyable stay. I found this hotel online, and it came highly recommended. It was convenient to everywhere in the city I wanted to go, though its location on Poydras street did mean the mornings were a little noisier than I expected due to the traffic, but you can't fault them for that. I had occasional difficulty with my room key working but still always got into my room. I didn't realize at booking that the hotel doesn't have a bar/restaurant and the room didn't have a refrigerator but that was my fault for not checking. Overall the staff was incredibly helpful, friendly, and made my stay. The hotel is very unique and original due to its history and not like every out-of-the-box hotel you find these days. It was nice to stay in a place with such character. Res877, Thank you very much for taking the time to share your comments about your stay with us at The Whitney Hotel.

1	AWESOME RESORT. The location is awesome. We listened to the waves breaking each night. Wonderful!! The staff is the greatest. Everyone we met was courteous, polite and very friendly. Eager to please. The one person that made it so wonderful was Chelsy. She was superb!!. She helped us pick just the right room and even showed us the rooms for our next visit, which we have already booked. You can't go wrong staying here.Greetings Donna S,Thank you for taking the time to review Pantai Inn. First and foremost, thank you for recognizing our teams efforts to ensure your complete satisfaction. I cannot agree with you more - Chelsea is a rockstar and she does a wonderful job looking after our guests needs. We appreciate you letting others know that they cannot go wrong staying here! On behalf of the team, hope to see you again soon.Cheers! Mike
1	Not a typical Courtyard. I recently stayed 2 nights at this property on a business trip. My room was nicely updated, comfortable and quiet. The staff were friendly and helpful. Rather than the typical Bistro set up in the lobby for food and drink, there is a full service restaurant and bar. The downtown location is excellent with easy access to multiple restaurant options. This is a good choice in downtown Philly.Dear StevefromKaty,It is so nice to read your wonderful review about your business stay at Courtyard Philadelphia Downtown! We are thrilled that you had an excellent experience, and we appreciate you highlighting our service and location. We would love to welcome you back the next time you are in the area. Thank you, David Kidd Assistant General Manager
1	Super Stay. Very pretty hotel. There was Wonderful lady at the check in desk and she handled everything with ease. We had a little bit of an issue but she was so great she didnt make it an issue. The room was spacious and quiet. Everyone and I mean everyone was helpful and friendly. The rooftop bar called The Monkey Board was so terrific. Saturday night was a fun dance party and Sunday afternoon we enjoyed the sun and had some of the most delicious crawfish i have ever had. Thank you so much for this fantastic review of your stay and please know that it has been shared among our team. Chef Dana will be thrilled to know how much you enjoyed his crawfish and its always nice to hear when the team exceeds all expectations of our guests.We appreciate you staying with us and look forward to always being your hotel of choice in New Orleans.Best regards,
1	Great value with points for Disneyland Visitors. I tend to be pretty loyal to Marriott brands and built up quite a bank of Marriott points, so when I went to book a room in Anaheim for a trip to Disneyland using my points I booked the Towneplace Suites for three reasons: (1) It was a much better value than any of the other Marriott properties in Anaheim, as it was a Category 3 for points redemption while the others were at least a Category 5.(2) It was the only Marriott property in Anaheim that did not charge a daily parking fee. (3) Free continental breakfast. I tend to be pretty cost conscious, so I would much rather fill up on a free hotel breakfast than pay for fast food or worse pay Disneyland food prices.I still had a few doubts, but I went into the stay with an open mind and wasn't disappointed. My biggest concern, the location in relation to Disneyland, ended up being a non-issue. The Anaheim Resort Transit shuttle ran like clockwork and I could be to the parks in less than 20 minutes. At a cost of only 12 for a three-day pass, it was much cheaper than parking at Disneyland and probably a good bit quicker as well. Even though the hotel isn't within walking distance of Disneyland I wouldn't hesitate to book again. The location was also a plus when I went to the Angels baseball game, as the stadium is about a half mile walk from the hotel. The room itself was more than adequate. The full size fridge and kitchenette with a dishwasher and stove was impressive but probably unnecessary for most hotel guests, however with the microwave and stocked dishes it would be very easy to prepare simple meals in the room to avoid the expense of eating out. The sleeping area was a totally separate bedroom which made it feel a little small, but it is probably about the same size as you would find in other Towneplace and other Marriott suite-style hotels. I think it is just the lack of openness that makes it feel small. Everything was nice and clean, no complaints there.I see that someone else complained about the breakfast, but I think it was as good as should be expected for free. I have seen fancier, but during my stay the breakfast included cereal (6 types), bagels, English muffins, yogurt, fresh whole fruit, instant oatmeal, and boxes of raisins (quite honestly I grabbed a few boxes each morning for snacks while in Disneyland). My only criticism would be to wait a little while longer to start shutting the breakfast area down, as 9:30am is still pretty early and most of these folks are on vacation after all.My only other complaint would be the toilet paper. I don't necessarily expect the nicest paper out there, but the stuff in my room was the roughest single-ply toilet paper I've ever seen. I think most gas station bathrooms have higher quality toilet paper than this. It just seems pretty ironic that while there was shampoo and conditioner by Paul Mitchell the hotel couldn't spend a little more for a decent two-ply. Overall I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel for anyone going to Disneyland or to an Angels games, although I may encourage them to bring their own TP.
1	Wonderful stay at the Hotel Monaco. The hotel was beautiful, our room was clean and well decorated - however the true gem in this hotel is the staff. Everyone was friendly, and extremely willing to accommodate any request, including a last minute late checkout and the need for extra umbrellas. Strongly recommend if you're in the Philadelphia area, as it's close to the train, the liberty bell, and a whole host of restaurants and bars.Eliza D -Sorry we couldn't keep the rain away! We tried our best. But happy to help you stay and linger a little longer. Hopefully we'll see you again soon!Best -Mark
0	America's Worst Value Inn. I hate writing reviews like this as a guy that owns a business, but you really shouldn't stay here... I knew going into this that i was getting a worker's hotel, but I didn't expect the used condom left in the garbage in my room, or the window that didn't have locks. I appreciate the new carpet and counter and... More
0	I don't recommend.. The room smelled musty and sink was located outside of the bathroom. We got better rooms for the same price. Very disappointed
1	Nice La Jolla resort. Stayed one night in January a week before the Farmer's Open. Hotel was bustling but the service was excellent. The rooms were in top shape. Nice bathrooms, comfy beds etc. Service is their specialty which begins with the bellman. Very nice group of employees. Didn't get a chance to try the restaurants but I heard they were good.Dear notoftheworld, It was our pleasure to welcome you to Estancia La Jolla. Thank you for highlighting our dedicated staff, especially our bellman. It's always a pleasure to hear when our team leaves such an impression. We hope to welcome you back soon to enjoy our Baja-inspired cuisine.
0	Not worth it. We have traveled to all areas of the US and realize high tourist areas such as this are normally higher priced lodging. However, when you pay a higher price for a hotel you expect the establishment to provide an equal value for your dollars. Not the case here. The front desk staff, both in the early evening and in the morning, have very poor customer service skills. We felt we were disturbing them any time we approached them. Also, the walkways and exterior areas have not been cleaned in months. The breakfast was bad! Never again!Dear Don G,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. We take all of our reviews seriously so we can better serve our Guests. Reading through your review I see the we fell short of your expectations. I apologize for the service that was provided. I will be sharing your comments with my staff, so that we can learn fro our short falls.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager
1	Its a Grand Slam kind of stay at a Luxury Hotel.. Upon my arrival here and stay for the night on a business trip I checked out this place online to see my value and what it had to offer for me. Walking into this place I was greeted with such respect and helpful people. I was very impressed with the lay out mostly the front door takes you right in front of the elevator so that I don' have to walk around to find my room or look for the elevators to take me up to the 6th floor. Once in the room I was very impressed with the mattress set they had to offer. Taking me to a deep and very comfy sleep. If there is one thing that I like to make sure hotels have to offer me is to have full 4G cell phone coverage on all floors, so that I can stay connected with my business partners and family while on the road. I have noticed in certain locations I did not have my full strength coverage as needed. This could be a very big improvement for any type of guest that may raise their customer experience while staying here.Thank you so much for your feedback, it really helps us understand what is working well and where we have opportunity. I will look into the cell phone strength and see what we can do to ensure we offer the best connection. We look forward to seeing you back with us soon!
1	Great amenities and pool service. This is a great hotel to relax. The landscape is beautiful. The pool is very nice but be aware there are a number of kids around the pool area (this does not bother me but I'm sure it will influence on the decision of many people who reads this review). Hotel restaurants are good and fairly priced.Service is not at the same level you'd expect from large hotel chains. Whatever you request will get eventually done... so relax and enjoy. You will leave with fond memories of your stay!Thank you for this excellent review! We truly appreciate the time you took to provide your comments and feedback. We apologize if our service did not meet or exceed your expectations. Please note that we are looking into this issue further. We look forward to your return, and hope to see you and your family soon!
1	Southern Hospitality in the Big City. Mission: To celebrate a 14th birthday in styleBottom line: Much thanks to Rory, Yolonda, Tania, Sonya, housekeeping and room service for making our stay a memorable one. Even numbered rooms for great view.The goal was to have a fancy room, be treated as if we were special along with hours of shopping. I called in advance and talked with Yolanda a very pleasant receptionist who transferred me to Rory the concierge about ideasWell this hotel went above and beyond. Upon our arrival, Tania at the front desk placed us in rooms 1821 (corner room) and 1806 (standard). Rory had chocolate covered strawberries, chilled sparking water, a balloon tied to candy, and a personal birthday card addressed to my daughter which many of the staff had signed already waiting her arrival. Our rooms were clean, spacious, didnt have lingering smells hotel rooms often do so obviously the housekeeping staff is on the ball. The corner room was spacious and beautiful, but the view wasnt as impressive and outstanding as our 1806 room which looked directly at downtown Atlanta. I suggest to anyone to get standard rooms on the even numbered side of the hotel. We shopped all day and then to dinner (Atlanta Fish Market), spent a few hours at the spacious Roman like pool, and slept in extremely comfortable beds. I want to add even the complementary shampoo actually had lather to it. Room service for breakfast provided a fabulous meal and even the coffee in the in room 4 cup pot wasnt too bad. My only adverse comment about my stay and this is being picky because the hotel had an event going on was I called ahead from my room for our car, about 10 minutes, and when we got downstairs they still had not brought the car up and we barely made our dinner reservation. I also was not too thrilled with the 30 dollar overnight parking fee. On check out Sonya at the front desk was very pleasant as well and having a great and personal attitude towards guest especially during busy is a real plus to me
0	Hotel near BWI airport. Parking lot not cleared of snow. Paths and road very slippery with no salt applied. Front desk not helpful. No hot water for shower in morning. Other guests had same issue. Front desk said there is no hot water problem and then told it is an old boiler which has issues.
0	They Forgot Me. After arriving at BWI, I called the hotel for a shuttle. 45 minutes later, I called again. The shuttle had never been dispatched, so I had to wait another 20 minutes before it arrived. No apology was forthcoming. There is no business center at this hotel and the restaurant needs a major upgrade. The room, however, was well maintained and comfortable.
1	Excellent Stay, tremendous location. Located right across the street from the Space Needle. The complementary breakfast buffet was excellent and much better than the Residence Inn hotels. There are several restaurants within walking distance for dinner. For the more economical meals, there is also a McDonalds across the street from the hotel. The Duck Boat tours also start from next to McDonalds.The rooms are of decent size and comfortable. They also have a complementary shuttle to the Pier 66 from where NCL ship departed. Will highly recommend it to people and will be my personal choice of stay in Seattle in future as well. The front desk staff is exceptionally polite and helpful (particularly Nate), and so are the shuttle bus drivers. Prices for the hotel are on the high end side, but so are most of the Seattle downtown hotels.ChandraHSGBI,We are thrilled to hear the Hyatt House met your needs and appreciate the positive feedback. Im glad you were able to take advantage of our 24 hour shuttle and the complimentary breakfast spread in the morning. Its wonderful to know when guests have a comfortable stay as we are grateful of the comments. We look forward to your next visit in Seattle!Sarah Junge
0	close to inner harbor.. After finding the comforter was stained my husband asked the front desk for another blanket and they gave us one. It appeared that a lot of people actually live at the hotel.
1	Wonderful stay!. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! The location is great, right on the beach and boardwalk. It was awesome to sit on our balcony and enjoy the ocean and people watch at the same time. I will mention that there are homeless people around but they are very unobtrusive and leave you alone. I never had one ask me for anything. The room was clean and the bed was comfy. There are boogie boards and sand toys that you can borrow which is nice so you don't have to waste your money and buying something you're going to have to leave. A couple suggestions for the hotel: 1. Breakfast...it would be nice if you offered gluten free muffins or cereal. Yogurt and hard boiled eggs get old fast. 2. Towel racks...More towel racks in the bathroom would be helpful. Drying swimsuits/towels and such would be much easier. Plus it would free up counter space to have the towels off of the counter.Thank you for taking the time to provide us with some helpful feedback! We greatly appreciate the helpful suggestions and will take them in to consideration. We are glad you enjoyed your stay with us and we hope to see you again soon.
1	Accomations. Very accommodating staff. Competitive pricing for downtown N.O. convenient location. Comfortable room. Good food in restaurant. Broken exercise equipment. 'fitness club' is a bit of a misnomer. We can recommend this to anyone else for a good place to stay with great location for many attractions.Thank you very much for your comments about your most recent stay with us at the Whitney Hotel! We are working on getting updated exercise equipment and I'm sorry it wasn't ready for you by the time you arrived. I am happy to hear that you had such an enjoyable stay overall and we hope to see you again the next time you come to New Orleans!Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
1	Dilemma Value/Location Vs Lack of Sleep. We chose this hotel based on the price and location. It certainly lived up to our expectations. It was by far the best value for money I could find with most other hotels almost double. Given we would be out and about most days we just wanted something decent we could get a good sleep in and was clean.River Hotel check in was quick and easy. After a long flight we asked for a quiet room that had a great view when we woke up.We got a room with a view of the alley way and some kind of air con vents outside (1011). Whatever the air con thing was outside had a constant hum and it would drive anyone crazy.The air con in the room was the only thing noisier! Impossible to sleep with it on even with the supplied ear plugs. It's not the city noise that's the problem it's these two things.We loved the free filtered water and bottles.So overall looking back on this trip I think the value and location win out ever so slightly. Maybe a different room would make a difference to this review overall of the hotel.
0	GROSS!!! Stay away!!!. I was so disgusted and disappointed with my stay here. The room was dirty and dusty (cobwebs, grime along floor boards, bugs in windowsill), the shower was FILTHY, the entire room was EXTREMELY outdated (carpet all over the walls - floor to ceiling), an accordian door on the bathroom, the sink was loose on the wall, dirt/mildew ring in the...

1	Excellent Stay. Great View, Close To Lake Restaurants. I stay at a lot of different Marriott properties and this Courtyard was one of the nicest of the Courtyard brand i've stayed at. It has a big lobby with plenty of seating and a dining area for the Bistro that is very nice. The front desk staff was as usual very friendly and accommodating. They had a room ready for me at 10am when I checked in. Starbucks coffee is served at the Bistro and they have a nice food menu as well. The room was immaculate and the bed was comfortable. Air conditioning was nice and cold. The view of the lake was excellent. I happen to be in Seattle on some beautiful weather days. Clear skies and no humidity. If your doing business downtown and need to see Amazon this hotel is a 6 Uber ride. You could walk to some nice restaurants on the lake or take a short taxi ride for 5. I would suggest Uber from the airport as opposed to a taxi. Uber was a 39 ride and the taxi was a 50 ride.Hi Thomas,Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful experience at Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union. Much appreciated for the comments on commute fairs and the positive feedback about our hotel and staff. Thank you for staying with us and we hope you see you again on your next visit to Seattle.Sincerely,Dan PhamGuest Service Representative
1	Weekend before cruise. Hotel is great and will stay here again! Located in the business district.Cab ride from airport for 3people is a flat 15pp. 2 people is 36.Day manager Kyle was fantastic and always made time to ask about our day.All staff was friendly and very nice.Free breakfast was very plentiful and decent choices.Evening free buffet was also plentiful plus you get 3 free drinks!Pool was nice and hot tub was large. 2 washers and dryers near the pool area.Beds were very comfortable and rooms were a good size.We had 2 queen beds, desk with business chair and a sitting chair.Our room also had a mini fridge and small microwave.Elevators will only work with a room key so that was nice for security.Located about 4blocks from French quarter it is a straight walk to bourbon street.St. Charles trolly stop just across the street that heads towards the French quarter so you don't have to walk if you don't want to.Cab ride back from French quarter was anywhere from 5 to 10My only drawback would be our room did not have a safe but other than that had no issues whatsoever and will look to stay in a Drury Inn again if it's in a city we are traveling to.
1	Another great stay at the Drury. My husband and I spent another weekend in NOLA recently for a college football bowl game. We chose the Drury for their consistency and great location. This time we were able to take advantage of their evening wind down happy hour. While the drinks were not of great quality, it's still a nice amenity. The hot dogs and nachos were a nice snack before our big game. The breakfast was most enjoyable. As always the room was very clean and comfortable. The staff was friendly and accommodating. The location is perfect for Superdome events and not a bad walk from Canal and Bourbon street activities as well.
0	Good location- friendly staff, shabby rooms. This dog friendly hotel has a wonderful web marketing team. Hotel is actually a barely updated 1960's era motel. Room was at or below motel 6 quality with tears in carpet, old unfilled holes in desks and tables. Bed and linens had been upgraded or I would have been too weirded out to stay. I got the sense that this... More
0	The most repulsive place I have ever had to lodge. This room should have been advertised for 19. I can't believe I spent 80 on this place! For starters, the sheets looked unclean, and when we pulled the blankets back the pillows beneath were -covered- in an assortment of straight and curly black hairs. I'm sure they haven't been laundered for centuries. There were moth wings melted into the insides... More
0	Consistency is key..had better experiences until today.. Adrianna was ghetto. Jay was trying to be professional in his t-shirt and jeans, even trying to correct my English. I've stayed at this property several times and was pleasantly satisfied. I simply needed a place to sleep, wash, and change for conferences that keep me out of the room more than in. Unfortunately, this session was horrible. I'm currently on the line with customer service seeking resolution. Again, before this stay I've never had these concerns. (Side note: the rate was higher than I've ever paid this time. I would think they customer service would match). Jay told a lie to the customer service agent and said he gave me time to make arrangements. He said he could lie because I lied on his front desk agent I simply shared how she acted.Mu, Thank you for sharing your concerns. Please know the service issues you describe are an exception to our guest commitment, and as such, we apologize. Our staff aims to provide the highest level of hospitality to our guests through our customer service, but with your experience, we have fallen short and would like to apologize for the service issues you describe. We invite you to contact our Guest Relations at 1-855-787-9864 to record the details of your visit to help us provide a better guest experience in the future.
0	Slightly scary, poorly maintained but v.cheap. We were delayed on our flight back to the UK by 6 hours and decided to book into a motel to wait. Days Inn was first we found and under 50 for a night. So v. cheap with free Wi-Fi and coffee machine. However, the lift was not confidence inspiring and creaked and crashed, the room was not as clean as it may be, we were pleased not to get in the beds and the general environment felt a bit rough/unsafe. We were fine though and had no real issues. Free Wi-Fi dropped constantly and the a/c would not stay on - kept cutting out. I would not stay overnight or at least not more than night and would only do so as a single traveller. Not quite an avoid but go with eyes open.
0	Dirtiest hotel I ever found. The most dirty hotel I have ever seen! I wonder if Choice Hotel group does any inspection for hotels owed by the company. Every inch of the hotel is unclean. If you want to enjoy your trip and cherish the natural beauty of the Estes Park never think about to stay in this hotel
0	You get what you pay for, sometimes less.... My family travelled to Anaheim for the winter break 2014. Now I know we only paid an average of 119 per night and i do not expect luxury at this price but I do expect things to work and the room to be clean. The room was gross. The outlets were falling out of the walls. They obviously do not... More
0	Poor cleaning service. This is my second review- the first one didn't pass the censorship of TripAdvisor. That's totally okay, I am feeling much nicer now. I am going to keep this short and simple.The location was great- 2 blocks from Jackson Square and so close to everything that I wanted to experience in the French Quarter. 5 stars from me on that one.The room itself was very large and for the most part comfortable. We had a windowless room, so it was very quiet- however disconcerting since we didn't have any idea of the time unless we checked a clock. The front desk staff was 50/50 for us- some of them were great, others acted like we were a big bother.Do not book this hotel if swimming in the pool is anywhere on your list of priorities. It really isn't any bigger than a hot tub.Now for the reason for my 2 star rating...Cleaning service came in on the second day and when we returned to our rooms were found hairs on our toothbrushes, and not the hair from my head.... on both of them.... so.....Anyway- my one attempt to speak to the front desk, I had one of the workers who seemed like she was bothered by everyone, and there was quite a line so I decided to just throw the do not disturb on the door and finish my last 2 days at the hotel without cleaning service. I had pre-paid for the room otherwise I would've made a bigger deal about it- but it just boiled down to what was worth my time and not being able to prove anything. And also trying to find a new hotel for the last 2 nights of my stay. I will not be returning to this hotel, and cannot give it a good recommendation on my experience.Typically housekeeping gets high marks for exceptional service - wasn't aware (during the visit) that there was a problem. Front desk is busy at times, but generally very responsive and cordial.
0	Falsely Advertised Services and Poor Customer Service. Shuttle only available if someone working at the time can drive it, which was never over 4 days there. Restaurant nearby is a Taco Bell in the parking lot. When spoke with front desk about problems, I was simply told the staff would be talked to, no effort to make up for poor service and misrepresentation.Dear lssnoopy2, Thank you for your review. Were sorry we didnt provide the quality of amenities and service you deserved during your recent stay at our hotel. We apologize for the issues with shuttle service availability, and we are working with our team to ensure these situations dont happen again. Your feedback is genuinely appreciated as it is the first step in helping us improve our services. If you return to our area, we hope youll stay with us again.
0	service is everything. this one has NONE. I didn't stay here. the place looks decent from the outside, but the inside....well, I never got that far. first, I entered the front desk area to have 2 men behind the desk. One just standing there, the other answering the phone...over and over the phone rang. he wasn't very plesant to the callers either. and after getting off the phone, he would mock and make fun of them. from the TV not working to the faucett leaking to the front door lock not working. his answer seemed to be maintenance isn't here, I can't do anything. really after about 10 mi9nutes, he got to me. I asked for any room, I'm not picky. he said sure we have one for ya...then I mentioned the corporate card I travel for business on and was told, he would see if he had a room.(card is for discounted rates like AAA) I then mentioned that I had a rewards number I wished to use and he handed me back the rewards card and said that the rewards points would not be awarded on discounted rates. (I have received rewards points on EVERY hotel I checked into with this same card including BW plus, Holiday inn, comfort/quality...every one! ) he then answered the phone again and interupted our conversation without even saying excuse me or anything...and after a few minutes of being ignored I left and told them i would find another hotel that was friendlier.I went a little farther toward the jobsite and got a room at another Best Western in Santee...where they are friendly and I really liked the empolyees and the location. (and I got the reward points like I have at all other hotels.)these guys were jerks, and I would rather sleep in my car than stay here. I will never stop here again.
1	Just like home. The staff are great. Breakfast pretty good. Convenient to airport. You can walk to loads of resturants. Far enough away from all the Disney to not be over crowded, but still closs to most attractions.Dear guest Robert A, I would like to thank you on behalf of my team at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport for your kind comments on our performance and your experience on your stay. We know that when traveling our guests have many options to choose from and we value and deeply appreciate your loyalty and support.

Sincerely,Alex BlancoGeneral Manager
1	Nice hotel for a short stay. We enjoyed this lovely hotel. It was nice to go to breakfast and look up and see the beautiful architectural details. The bank vault of course was extraordinary. We learned that the hotel is still attached to a working bank. The restaurant was lovely and the bacon egg and cheese croissant was fresh and delicious. The room was nice enough and clean enough. We would definitely stay here again for a quick stay.Thank you for your recent stay with us at the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans! We greatly appreciate your kind words and look forward to hosting you again soon. If we can be of further assistance, please don't hesitate to contact us directly. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
0	Unprofessional --- charged me for an immediate cancellation!!!. I called the hotel from the Atlanta airport where I was stranded. They could not find my business account on the phone---even though I have a corporate account and are one of the largest companies in the world. I was too tired to keep asking the operator. I booked and then immediately---and I mean immediately called twice to cancel as I didn't understand how far away the hotel was from the airport. I called twice and my question was brushed off. Both operators were very professional, but were obviously trained how to brush off those questions and immediately ask if I wanted to book something else. I have stayed all over the world for decades and have never, ever been charged a no show for cancelling within a couple minutes of booking. Heck, I've even been refunded airline tickets when I immediately cancel. You can tell me it was your policy, but the hotel seriously lacks the desire to do the right thing. I have stayed in another Aloft before and have been a faithful SPG member for many years. I assure you that I will avoid this chain and will spread the word within my company to do the same.Dear TampaDude2, We sincerely apologize for your dissatisfying experience while booking your stay. Its our goal to provide excellent customer service to our guests throughout the entire booking process, and we are very sorry we fell short on this during your cancellation call. We completely understand your frustrations, so we would like to rectify your experience by refunding your cancellation should you decide to personally contact us with your confirmation number. Please email our General Manager, Terry Hitt, at tery.hittaloftatlantadtn.com, to further amend your situation. Again, we are very sorry for your experience, but we hope you will consider staying with our hotel when you have more time to visit the Atlanta area. All the best.
1	Diamond in the Rough. This was a very nice hotel. Great location. Staff nice and professional. One stood out for me and was very helpful and fair. Her name is Sarah- Sarah Smile. She upgraded my room due to my room was not ready after the check in time. She was also so helpful with telling us where we could walk to for a great meal. We were able to walk to the Casino, Bourbon Street, Canal Street, etc- it is really a great little hotel in a perfect location. Oh yeah, the roof- we thoroughly enjoyed. Nice mingle spot! Good drinks and food! Don't slip- I heard about and purchased thru Hotwire as not known until I paid for it- great choice-but will book direct next time. I do recommend to your review readers and I will stay there again.Thank you for the wonderful review and recognizing the efforts of our hard working team here at The Troubadour. We appreciate that you took a few minutes to share your experience for others to appreciate. It's always nice to read what our guests have to say. We look forward to your next visit.WayneGeneral Manager
1	Charming and affordable!. My husband and I stayed here 3 nights in May 2011 after a cruise. The staff was friendly and helpful, and our room was comfortable, spacious and clean. The building has old-style class and charm. When we reserved we requested a small refrigerator with a freezer unit (to re-freeze cooler pack for my husband's insulin) it was present when we arrived, but not freezing properly -- it was fixed promptly and worked fine the rest of our stay. The breakfast buffet was much nicer than average and includes do-it-yourself waffles. (Make sure to get to the breakfast within the stated hours -- they are serious about shutting down on time.) The free drink and snack time each evening was a nice perk, though we were only present for it once -- too many other things to do in the area! The rooftop pool and hot tub looked great, but the weather was a little too cool to make use of them while we were there -- go up for the area view even if you don't want to have a soak.
1	another good stay. great location especially to Georgia Tech and the restaurants in mid town. Nice lobby with a terrific wine hour during the week (including Friday). This trip the valet was well staffed so people were not waiting for vehicles for a long time. Rooms were nice and clean although door to bathroom was very difficult to move (better than last trip when it would not stay closed at all). Rooms were quiet and beds comfortable. Breakfast was superb even with full house during a football weekend. Would surely return. Only issue was that our bags were given to the valet at 2pm and at 6pm they were still sitting in the lobby--nothing stolen but this lack of security or follow through is not what one would expect from any property. lighting could also be better in the bathrooms.Thank you for taking a few minutes to share your feedback. I think you stayed at our sister property in Mid-town based on your comments, I will be sure to share them with that team. Hope to see you back in Atlanta soon!
0	Gateway to Hell. Employees rude, not helpful. Drugs run amuck here. permanent residents are evil, carry guns, sell drugs, immoral sexual acts. Older property without updates. Air conditioning didn't work during my stay.
0	Dirty, uncaring, and run down. I DONT SUGGEST.... Our window was broken, luckily we were on the third floor but it got very cold, and the heat had only one setting which was 80 so then we got heated out, heard sirens all night and loud cars, and they wouldnt move us to another room. Phone didnt work so each time we had a problem we had to walk all the way over to the office. Needles and homeless people all over the stairways. Elevator smelled of urine so bad we could never take it. No hot water, and very low water pressure. It was in downtown SF in which is another story, of course tons of homeless sleeping everywhere around the hotel. Lobby workers very rude and uncaring.
1	A decent place to stay only 15 minutes from UCF. This hotel is a step above comparable discount hotels on Colonial drive. The rooms were in good shape, clean and everything was updated and worked well. The free breakfast was above the standard breakfast typically at budget hotels and the pool was clean and in good shape.Thank you for choosing our property for your most recent stay. I would like to thank you on behave of our staff for the positive feedback you've provided us with in your review. We hope that you will choose our property again and that you will enjoy staying with us in the future.
0	Got What I Paid For.... I stayed at this hotel a month ago, and I got it on Hotels.com with a coupon. When I arrived, the night clerk was not too friendly, but was fast in completing the check-in process. The room was on the ground level, and had some noisy people walking past it throughout the night. On the good side, the bed and pillows were clean and comfortable, and the were plenty of lightning options in the room. I got a good night's rest. It also had a flat-screen TV, but I didn't watch it, so I can't comment on whether it worked or not. On the bad side, the shower did not have any hot water, and the sink faucet did not produce any water at all. So I had to take a cold shower and had to wash my hands, brush my teeth, etc. by turning on the water faucet in the bathtub and washing in my hands and moistening my toothbrush in the resulting flow of water. There were also none of the freebies you expect at a hotel, like toothpaste. Another downfall was that hard to step in and out of because the outer wall was high. I almost slipped when I got out of the shower.The morning clerk was friendly and completed the check-out process quickly. Overall, I would only stay here for a night at most. And ask for a room with running water in the sink and hot water in the shower.
0	Horrible breakfast, horrible customer service. The manager was arguing with another guest in front of everybody when we arrived. Our room was not ready at check in time. The elevator stopped working, breakfast was horrible. Our bathroom was clogged up when we arrived and we have to call guest services.
1	Fantastic Location, Great Staff. The hotel is ideally located in center city across the street from Reading Terminal market. They did a nice job modernizing this hotel. It is also very clean. Check in was great. I was in town for the night and booked a room last minute. I had 4 adults in one room and when I booked the only available option was 1 queen and 1 sofa bed in a room. I asked if they have any rooms available with 2 beds and they were able to accommodate me last minute which was great. Also at checkin they provided 2 cold bottles of water which was a nice touch. The room was very clean nice. The rooms have a full refrigerator, sink, microwave, dishwasher, coffee machine. The bathroom is simple, my room had a standing shower with a glass door. The pool was simple and on the smaller side. Parking like every other hotel is expensive and you will find better options searching on your phone to park yourself. The complimentary breakfast was solid, they offer waffles,yogurt, juice, prepackaged omlets and breakfast sandwiches that were very good. I have been to Philly many times over the years for Eagles games and stayed at 20+ hotels in the city and Home2 Suites would definitely be in my top 3. I highly recommend it!Dear Matthew,I would like to thank you for choosing the Home2 Suites by Hilton Philadelphia for your recent stay. I appreciate all of your wonderful comments and I am glad you enjoyed your stay with us! With so many choices here in center city Philadelphia, we greatly appreciate your business and look forward to welcoming you back soon, until then...With Hospitality,Jason Bloom General ManagerHome2 Suites by HiltonYour Second Home Away From Home
1	Garden District Convenience. Great place to stay - very convenient location - right on St Charles Avenue - streetcar stop only steps away. Breakfast was excellent, room very comfortable - really liked the two separate sinks and in-room safe. Parking included - a real plus. Staff was very friendly, cheerful, and helpful. I prefer the quiet atmosphere and beautiful homes of the Garden District.Donna,We are so happy that you enjoyed your stay with us. Our staff members try very hard to make sure guests have a comfortable experience when they are away from home. Please consider our hotel again the next time you're in New Orleans!Melissa Albert, General Manager
0	lost. They lost my resveration, I gave them a copy and they still took half an hour to find it. When they did find it, they said they already sold my room because of the late check-in I PAYED BY CREDIT CARD ON LINE! I reserved it at 5pm and showed up at 7pm!!! Then they said they could sell me a room that cost more... it took me another 15 minutes to get them to give me a simular room. simple right... 2 beds smoking guess they don't get it. When I got home I found out that not only did I pay for it on-line, I also payed for it twice with them. The ONLY thing this place has going for it is that it is clean, but pay in cash or over pay!Hello Ms. Sara,We apologize for all the trouble you faced at our hotel. We looked into your matter, it seems the confusion was created because of our new hire. After reading your review we are going to put more effort in training our new employees so that our guest don't go through the same trouble you did.Thank you for appreciating our clean rooms. We hope to see you again, so that you would experience ease of checkin that your deserved.Sincerely,Veronica
1	Home in the garden district. This is not a luxury hotel. I give it five stars because of location, parking, cleanliness , but most of all for the staff. Sitting in the lobby is like being an honored guest in someone's home. Great breakfast, fruit and cheese or fresh baked cookies in the evening. Great veranda for watching the world go by. I have stayed there two times and will again I hope. Street car stops in front and takes you to canal St to explore the French quarterThank you for taking the time to review your stay Ann! I'm glad your group enjoyed your time visiting the city and our hotel. Our lobby and veranda are great places to relax after exploring the city all day. Let us know the next time you are ready to stay with us! We will be here to help you plan your trip!Kathleen Davis, Front Office Manager
0	Do Not Recommend. The A.C. in our room was broken, the toilets and refrigerator ran all night long, and the floors were very dirty - visible enough to where I would not walk barefoot on the carpet. We got in late and the kids were exhausted so it was too inconvenient to request a different room. It was super warm all night long, and for 300+ a night, was completely unimpressed. We mentioned the issues our room had at the check out desk. The clerk responded, I'm sorry - I'll add these issues to the list our maintenance guy already has for that room... So they gave us a room knowingly had problems.Terrible customer service. Would not recommend.Hello,We apologize for the experiences you had during your visit. Please feel free to contact me at the property directly. Thank you,Devin H
1	Fantastic Location!. Overall I was quite pleased with the River Hotel. The location alone makes this hotel worth it. Its located right by the Chicago river 1 block from the Magnificent Mile. There is even a Double Decker trolly stop right near the hotel.The rooms were smaller then normal but there werent uncomfortably small. The bathroom was a decent size and the room had everything I could have wanted.Maid staff was fantastic and left extra towels as requested.Bella Bacino restuarant is located within the hotel and we had a fabulous Chicago style deep dish pizza there.My only concern with the hotel was its hard to see when driving down Wacker drive. Its well hidden. If you cross the Magnificent mile you have gone too far. As well when checking in we had reserved 3 rooms and they were showing a record of only 2 rooms. They did work towards figuring things out but it did take some time. Once we were given our rooms we were told we had 3 rooms with a queen size bed and a sleeper chair. Unfortunatly 2 of the rooms didnt have sleeper chairs so we had to go back to the front desk and be relocated again. It was a bit of a pain but nothing terrible. They did have a secured area on the 3rd floor to store luggage after checking out so that we could still tour the city.All in all a great expericen for the price.
0	A Good Place to Stay, If...... This hotel gets the job done. It gives you a place to sleep... that is, unless the staff decide to give your room to someone else, like they did during my stay. Imagine my surprise as I lounged on the bed with my fiance watching TV when someone unlocked our room door and walked in with her luggage! Of course that meant we had to reset our keys. The hotel also gives you a decent breakfast the night after your stay. Unfortunately each of the juice containers dispense juice along with black residue that settles in the bottom of your cup, so you'll probably want to stick with one of the two hot tea options. Try to get a room on the upper floors, as there was a religious concert of some sort complete with electric guitars and full drum set on the bottom floor at 8:30 am Sunday morning. If you're trying to relax in your room after waking up, beware that it might not be that tranquil as the cleaning women yell at each other down the hallway for about 45 mins-1 hr as they clean your floor.
1	Great Property - Excellent Staff. Consistent and convenient. This is a great place to rest in Orlando! We always book here when we are traveling to Orlando whether it be for business or for pleasure! The Staff is very efficient and always helpful. The Breakfast is awesome! And the Restaurant Staff is very attentive, they are the best!Dear Guest Steven K, I would like to thank you on behalf of my team at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport for your kind comments on our performance and your experience on your stay. Every single employee of this hotel prides themselves in the quality of their work striving for 101 to exceed our family guest's expectations every day.I want to thank you for your loyalty and support. We are looking forward to welcome you, family and friends to once again provide you with an outstanding level of service and nothing less. Sincerely,Alex BlancoGeneral Manager
0	Nice Casino/Terrible Management. A nice clean casino with affordable restaurants. However, the service you get from the hosts and managers are nothing short of Unacceaptable. Being one of the newest casino in Summerlin area does not give management the right to have a chip on their shoulder. Unlike other casinos who treat their guest as if they would want to be treated, the Suncoast management don't care if one has a pulse as long as one bring in revenue to their casinos.Their compensation for players is Zero. You can be sitting there for 5 hours and end up with a 10 buffet voucher, which they will write it off on their expenses. I stop an executive host to ask a question about the table action and he purposely ignored me and walked away. I have been to this casino in the past and swear to my family and friends that I will never make the drive and step in this casino AGAIN. Suncoast management should understand that they are not the only casino in Vegas and they are not close to being the best. I would rate them bottom of the barrell.Suncoast management: Go back to the basics and treat customers well and they will come back for more action.
1	Wedding Anniversary. We are from New Orleans and decided to celebrate our wedding anniversary by staying in the French Quarter and having dinner at Galatoire's. We choose the Bienville House because of its location and the reviews on TripAdvisor. The hotel lived up to its reputation - excellent. Very welcoming staff - large, well appointed room with antique looking (maybe the real thing) furniture - terry cloth robes. This was one of the best hotels I have stayed in anywhere - New York, Chicago, Dallas - anywhere. And, all for a very reasonable price - a great value.We are so glad you had a wonderful wedding anniversary stay with us at Bienville House! It sounds like you had a great trip. Please come again soon for another great stay!
1	Definitely recommend Hotel Abri!. The location and price of this hotel were exactly what we wanted...1 block from the BART and 2 blocks from Union Square. The hotel is very well managed, clean, and comfortable. Great showers and comfortable beds. We weren't in the hotel much as we were on a vacation and were busy running around but we looked forward to coming home to our hotel each night and finding dinner at all the local restaurants. It's centrally located to everything you'll want to see. We're very frugal people so we vetted many, many hotels. And finally settled on this one. So glad we did! Anytime we go back to San Francisco (which now we want to make a regular thing out of it) we want to stay at Hotel Abri. We even looked into their enrollment program to earn free nights...and we never do that. When we were initially debating whether to stay in the Fisherman's Wharf area or Union Square, we ultimately decided we wanted to be in the city...not a tourist attraction, so we went with Union Square. It was great to visit touristy areas but come back to local life. That said, Union Square is a huge shopping mecca so you could argue that its a commercial area. But the vibe feel much more local. This hotel is like staying Union Square in NY versus sleeping in Time Square...exactly how we wanted to experience San Fran.
0	Ok for 40/night, wouldn't stay again. Hotel conveniently located off of interstate 40. This hotel is very run down. It appears that there has been attempts to remodel parts of the premises. In my room The carpet was very old and disgusting. There was stains and it smelled unpleasant. The hallways reeked of tobacco and the air conditioning in the rooms was turned off making us... More
1	Clean and tidy.. Clean, tidy and convenient for the airport. Shuttle service very prompt and courteous. Impressed that front desk staff loaned umbrellas to guests making their way out to their cars in the thunderstorm.If you are eating, I recommend the BBQ chicken flatbread.Thank you for your complimentary words regarding your recent stay at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport. It is great to hear that you loved our location close to the airport along with the convenience of our shuttle service. We are so glad to hear that you were impressed by the hospitality and service delivered by our front desk staff. We appreciate your business and look forward to serving you again. All the Best,Debra Thompson-FrenchGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport
1	Wedding + mini vaca. I love this property! Absolutely beautiful grounds! We attended a friend's wedding and even though we live locally, decided to stay overnight and enjoy the resort. Each and every one of the staff was so nice. We received extra special attention by Brenna, who took time to make sure our stay was perfect. I can't wait to come back!Thank you for taking the time to share you 5 star feedback with us as review like these are simply the best to see! We are delighted to hear you so greatly enjoyed the grounds and that you had such a wonderful experiences with the staff. Your review will surely be shared to not only Brenna but to the entire team. We hope we have the pleasure of welcoming you back in the near future and thank you again for such a lovely review!
0	Room condition. We were the only people staying that night. Across the road the hotel had many guests for that night...tells you something, does it not. Also our room had a noisy fan and the heat was hard to control
0	There are worse places BUT. I made reservations online through the Wyndham rewards website and when I got to the hotel the desk clerk informed me that he would have given me a better rate but since I booked online he couldn't change anything. The hallways of the hotel reeked of cigarette smoke. There was a loud argument going on down the hall from our... More
0	So bad it needs to be Closed during Renovations!!!. So I've actually written good reviews about this hotel before. I first started going here 7 years ago and back then it was great. During the years they kept getting bought out by new companies and every time it went under new management it would be more and more cheap and the quality would go down each time I visited... More
0	Worst Hotel I have ever stayed in and NOT SAFE!. I stayed at this hotel in October for 2 nights and it is run down, there wasn't even a glass in the room, nothing in the kitchen, carpet dirty, tub dirty and the room smelled. The second night I stayed there I went out the next morning to get into my truck and my tailgate had been stolen. I was a single woman traveling alone and felt very unsafe staying here. When I went down to the front desk to report it and check out there was only a maid working the front desk and it took 30 minutes to find someone that could help me. I filed a police report and after several tries I finally got to speak to a manager, that did no good as he just lied to me and finally the insurance company called and said they weren't paying for the tailgate. A hard lesson learned! Please, please do not stay at this hotel you are not safe, I'm just thankful I didn't walk up on them in the process of the burglar.
0	Dissatisfying for the dollar charged. We arrived at the hotel feeling positive about the location and warm-ish greeting at reception. This feeling did not last long. The pillows were really uncomfortable, both of the taps were hot, the AC was so loud and made a buzzing noise (we asked twice to have this fixed and nothing changed), the fire alarm went off at 3am and there was never really an excuse given as to what was going on, then (because we'd had no sleep) we put the 'do not disturb' sign on and the cleaner banged on our door repeatedly shouting 'housekeeping' until we answered. The water was shut off one evening from 11pm-3am which meant that when we had to go to the toilet it sat there for hours. No one informed us where a smoking area was so we assumed there was not one... this meant that we smoked out the front and got disturbed, bugged and pushed by homeless people asking for money, cigerettes, etc. It really was just one thing after the other. The cups were so rubbish that they leaked, my oartner hit his head on the shower because of a stupid bar across the top and they charged 50 dollars a night for a hold This was not really made clear at the beginning and I was left wondering why I was missing so much from my account. I have stayed in many hotels, hostels, bnbs over the years and had just stayed in 4 other places, all were LESS money and gave a better, quality experience.
1	Good Hotel, Great Location. PROS: Amazing views from lake view rooms worth extra 10! Great location close to Space Needle and great restaurants in Lower Queen Anne. We walked to Space Needle and City Center in 15 minutes, it's about 1.1 miles. If you include parking, it is faster to walk. The newly completed MOHI is right across the street, which is well worth the price of admission - we spent half a day there. Great, friendly customer service from front desk staff (Marriott 800-number, not so much.) Now that construction is complete on Mercer access to downtown and the freeway is a piece of cake. Free evening (after 9am-4pm) and weekend parking right across the street (vs 27/night garage parking). CONS: Marriott reservations gave me a hard time trying to get a cheaper rate that came available. Water in room is 3.00. Candy bar in market is 3.50 and they have removed the vending machines. Two cans of beer in market were 14 (the price of 12 a the store). Bistro menu is pretty short. We were not sure if there was any breakfast room service because there was only a dinner menu in our room. Power button on TV remote did not work, but channel changer and volume did.WEIRD: I have never seen a green flushing toilet that used so much water!!! The flushes were torrential. More than my standard toilet at home by double.Thank you so much for taking the time to share your recent experience at our hotel on Trip Advisor! I am happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us, particularly the view from your room! We love the changes that have been taking place in the South Lake Union neighborhood, particularly now that the roadwork is complete. I did want to share that while we do offer room-delivery for dinner, our breakfast is only available in the Bistro. However we are happy to package anything on the menu to-go if needed!We hope you will choose our hotel again next time your travels bring you to Seattle.Sincerely,Rachel PackardFront Office Supervisor
1	Great hotel, great service, great everything.. My boyfriend and I were taking a road trip to Las Vegas (starting in MI), and we planned to stop in Chicago for a night. I found this hotel online and after seeing the location as well as the price, I was sold. When we arrived, the valet personnel were extremely helpful. They gave us a map to where we could self-park if we weren't interested in using valet, which was only about 2 blocks away. While he parked, I had someone assist me with our bags. They were quick and very friendly, telling me all the things we should do during our short stay. When I got to the room, everything was nice and clean, and though previous reviews say that the room is too small, I found that it was just what we needed for a night. The bed was comfortable, there was enough room to put our multiple bags/suitcases. The bathroom was very clean and the shower had a hand-held shower head, which was nice. We were visiting family that evening, so we wanted to bring a dessert to them. We asked (who I believe was) the manager there where the nicest/closest bakery was, and he told us about Magnolias. The desserts were incredible, a very good recommendation. The next morning, we ordered room service for breakfast from the restaurant downstairs because we were too comfy to even get out of bed. The food was brought up very quickly and was not too expensive at all, plus it was delicious. The only downside to the stay was that you have to pay for parking once again if you choose to leave and come back. However, everything else was great. There is a Starbucks right next door as well as several shopping stores within walking distance. The hotel staff that we had the pleasure of interacting with were all very kind and helpful. We will definitely be coming back for our next trip to Chicago.
0	RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN FROM THIS PLACE. I had booked this room through Travelocity so it was paid in full. We decided to book here because I wanted to treat my family to TWO king beds and had booked this type of room. We arrived at 5:00 pm after traveling all day and was told our room was not ready even though check in was at 3:00. Told the manager that was unacceptable and he offered a one king/one sofa room. Told him this was unacceptable. He then offered a two queen room. After some haggling I asked for a discount and he offered 30 or 40 and would email Travelocity to adjust my price. Later I ran into him and he asked if I needed anything and I said an email from Travelocity with my refund which he said I would get in 10 minutes. By morning still no email so I called Travelocity directly who was WONDERFUL and called the manager while I was on hold and got the refund processed. Had I not called I am certain there would not have been a refund issued. As for this place: Run as fast as you can. There are people here that must rent by the month and are quite shady. Lots of garbage built up outside rooms, the parking lot has thousands of cigarette butts, lots of partying and ruckus during the night. Our bathroom had dirty footprints and there was literally a hole in the wall where the cable line is and we could see straight through to our neighbors room. The grounds are a mess. Breakfast was a complete joke. Make your own eggs in an electric fry pan. But there were no eggs, only 4 pieces of toast and a few mini muffins left that I put on a plate for my still sleeping family and got yelled at by the scary looking front desk worker when I arrived at 8:00. Yes, there was a sign that says no food out of the breakfast area but at that point I did not care about following the rules. A nice lady eating breakfast after me dug through the cabinets and found an extra container of muffins and a box of frosted flakes but according to other people eating they forgot to go shopping and that is why they were short on food. The dispenser for the juice was not filled---instead you poured your own from the jugs they had from the store that who knows how long were sitting out.
1	Nice Stay, Well Located. I had a nice 5-night stay at this hotel. I was originally supposed to stay for 4 nights but my flight got cancelled and the hotel, graciously and without hassle or fanfare, allowed me to stay in my same room for an extra night and for the same nightly rate that I had booked when I was making my original reservation online. My room was located on the ground floor towards the back and the only disturbance was the restaurant next door late in the evenings. However, I'm not a light sleeper so once I went to bed, it didn't bother me at all. The legendary cat greeted me when I was checking in (around midnight) and he allowed me to pet him. I only saw him once more during my stay. This hotel is very well located - there are 2 cafes within 5 minutes walk and another 1 about 20 minutes' walk away - and there's a barbecue place right next door, a diner around the corner and a gourmet pizza place across the street. I sampled them all and was happy with my meals and coffee drinks. The hotel serves a continental breakfast. It's nothing to write home about but it will hold you for a few hours and I liked the convenience of not having to go in search of breakfast first thing in the morning. Ponce City Market is very nearby so there are a tonne more food options within easy reach. My room was well kept and very clean. It looks pretty dated but is very well maintained. My only problem was that the hot water took more than 15 minutes to really get hot and since I'm not a big fan of wasting water, I ended up taking tepid/warm showers most of the time, instead of really hot the way I like it. The staff were helpful when needed but not overly friendly. I had a good stay and I would return to this hotel if I needed to stay in that area again. Oh, and there's a Publix behind the hotel, about a 3 minute walk, which was very convenient when I needed cold medicine.
0	Low Budget. You can't expect much for 50, however our room was clean, although the furnishing are well worn. The bathroom was large and AC worked. The area attracted homeless folk which may put guests at ill-ease. Doors did triple lock.
1	Wonderful birthday weekend. I headed to Chicago to celebrate with friends all of our September birthdays and the Central Loop Hotel was amazing. Great location, great service and so comfortable and clean. I would describe it as a New York style room - small but certainly roomy. The beds were amazing, the pillows so soft and fluffy and my entire experience (3 days) was great. The staff was incredibly helpful and found me a room that was ready for an early check-in. I really liked that on each floor at the elevators they had a purified water station and empty, sealed water bottles for the guests use. What a great idea. The attached Elephant Castle was a great spot for a cocktail or breakfast.
0	nice for family. We pick this place to stay in Anaheim, price is what we can afford and it is clean and comfortable. It is a half mile walk to our destination and an easy walk. We don't have to worry about the high parking rate at the Convention Center.Thank you for your recent stay. Thank you for taking the time to provide us with feedback. We look forward to your next visit to Anaheim.
1	Nice hotel. My wife booked this hotel for our conference. The room was nice and service was great if we requested anything they were quick to help. We didn't use the pool as it was usually raining when we would have used it. It would be nice to have a restaurant in the hotel although there are several places to eat nearby. The front lobby is kinda cool. Beds were comfortable and we had a good sleep. We wish not all lights were on one switch.Just another reason for you to return nothing better than a rooftop pool on a sunny day!Thanks for staying,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations
1	You get what is advertised. When you see a hotel in a great location in Atlanta costing about 80 per night, you know it's not going to be the Holiday Inn. I saw the bad reviews, but none of the complaints proved true, the hot water worked fine. Other than the seam in the carpet being visible, a most uneven floor, and a TV a little far from the bed, there was nothing to criticize. The room was clean and large with a sofa, small fridge, microwave, and comfortable bed. Some may be offended because the bathroom is small and the lavatory is in the room. Virginia Highlands is a great, downtown neighborhood with great restaurants. One block away is the very nice and reasonably priced hipster Sweet Auburn BBQ which is not traditional BBQ, but good. Within a few blocks are residential streets listed on the historic register because of their unique architecture. The neighborhood feels safe. The King Center, Carter Center, and Fernbank Science Museum are no more than 5-10 minutes by car depending on the traffic. For the same price you can stay at an econolodge near a mall at an interstate exit with newer carpet. Thank you for taking the time to leave such an extensive and wonderful review of the hotel. We love that you appreciate our uniqueness and that you were able to truly experience our neighborhood. Please come back and visit us again soon!Best wishes, Kristin Anderson Assistant Hotel ManagerThe Highland Inn
1	Everything is awesome (except the free wifi)!. Stayed here for 3 nights with my girlfriend. We loved San Diego and this hotel was in a great location. Walking distance (and safe walking day or night) to the Gaslamp Quarter and to the Harbour. And the street does not get too much traffic so uber/taxi/shuttle pick up and drop off is easy (10 minute drive to the zoo and SeaWorld and Petco Park). The room itself was fantastic. We got a room with a great view of the city and bay. The room was very clean with great air con, comfy bed, and hot shower. I really wanted to give this place 5 stars but I couldn't because of the wifi. It's free, but it was useless. Could not stay connected and when I could it was awfully slow. But we still had a good time and this hotel overall, only enhanced our stay in San Diego. We will be back! (hopefully the wifi will be improved by the time we do ) )EN4C3R- Thank you for your loyalty to the Westin San Diego. We are so thrilled you enjoy our location, breakfast and the Westin Heavenly brand products. We are also currently planning our CAT6 wifi upgrade throughout the entire hotel and will be very excited when this is completed. We look forward to your return to sunny San Diego and getting that 5 star review from you next time!Be Well, Alyssa Turowski, General Manager
0	Overpriced Hotel with Meager Ammenties. Room was adequate, but the hotel needs maintenance bad. Porch deck was dirty, the outdoor carpeting was awful...don't walk without shoes! The weeds at the hotel entrance were an indication of how they maintain the rest of the hotel. Breakfast was granola, milk, OJ, and store bought stale cake...no fruit or anything. Staff goes home early so don't have a... More
0	Scared for my life. Before you read: This hotel is so bad, that I had to create an account on here and tell about my experience here. This is from the eyes of a 16 year old boy.

1	Excellent hotel. This is a very good hotel, with a professional and friendly staff, large and very clean rooms, good breakfast and a nice pool. Location was perfect for us, close to highway, but still quiet at night. Parking was always available and close to our room.Dear Jos R., We wanted to take this time to thank you, and let you know how grateful we are for you 5 star review. Its because of honest testimonials like yourself that helps other hotel shoppers find us. Our rooms range from standard hotel room size to apartment size suites depending on your personal taste. We have a good selection of food in our continental breakfast from hard boiled eggs, yogurts and fruits to waffles, pastries and bagels (just to name a few). Since its the most important meal of the day we encourage our guest to join us every day from 6am to 10am. We are centrally located in the college area and like you mention we are near the highway 8, which is easy access to all fun attractions San Diego has to offer. College area is well known for its college student living nearby of course. We are glad you were able to experience the nights are calm and quiet helping you enjoy your night sleep without any interruption. Again, we would like to thank you for choosing to stay with us. We hope we can be of service to you again in the future. Yours in hospitality,Lily Evans Front Desk
1	Eccentric Bar - Hidden Gem. Went to Broken Shaker on the tip from a friend and so glad we did. The bar is almost hidden in the back of the Freehand Hotel/Hostel in Chicago. It is small and intimate and warm and inviting. There is so much to see in this small bar from the Hand Painted Octopus mural on the wall (and hidden on the 70's wallpaper) to the macram wall hangings. It definitely feels like you are in your parent's basement in the 70's - but cooler. The cocktails are delicious. We had the B*tch Don't Kill my Vibe and the margarita with chorizo salt. Another friend got their famous Cocoa Puff Old Fashioned. All were delicious. We didn't eat at the Broken Shaker on this visit, but saw some food being brought out and it all looked wonderful. We will definitely be back!Hi Casa1234, Thanks for visiting us and I am so glad to hear you LOVED the Broken Shaker. We are so excited to be able to welcome people into our amazing space and we can't wait to welcome you back for some more cocktails and food!!
0	Very disappointing. We booked 2 rooms because of the excellent price. We have always been huge fans of Microtel hotels, but this one disappointed greatly.

1	Superior Service and Fun Atmosphere. I must begin by thanking the guest services staff who worked pleasantly to return a jacket I accidentally left in my room closet! Michael and Bridget were beyond gracious when I phoned to ask if the items could be found and then shipped to my home. Their attitudes and attention were lovely! Our Thanksgiving weekend was very pleasant due to the fun atmosphere and beautiful Gatsby-ish decor along with the great staff. We enjoyed prosecco and hot toddies in the evenings and wonderful continental breakfast at the hotel restaurant. Our room on the 12th floor was quiet and the elevator service was great. We simply cannot praise this hotel enough! There were many nice conversation areas sprinkled around the lobby which were inviting and provided nice areas to enjoy the holiday decorations! Be sure to join the Kimpton Rewards program for free WiFi and credit for the minibar! Dont hesitate to book this great downtown/theatre district hotel!Thank you for taking the time to provide your feedback. It is great to hear that our staff was able to assist in returning your jacket to you! And we are happy that you enjoyed your stay overall - from the 20's style lobby and Prosecco hour to our Italian restaurant and convenient location. We hope to welcome you back soon!
0	Was probably a nice hotel at one point.. Nice staff, room almost too small to turn around in. Kind of dirty feeling, bed should've been replaced five years ago. Can hear every noise next door and in the hall.
0	Avoid the water. My two daughters drink water out of the tap and both became ill with stomach aches. If you have to stay here do not drink any of the water.I am sorry about your daughters but Water from city of Cleveland,OH
1	San Francisco Fave!. I've stayed here three times! All of which have been splendid and memorable! The staff make you feel like your coming home! There are a lot of choices when it comes to hotels in San Francisco, make it easy on yourself and pick the St. Regis! Dear sullyontv,Thank you for sharing your review of The St. Regis San Francisco. I am delighted to hear that you have enjoyed your experiences, and sincerely appreciate your high recommendation of our hotel. Please do not hesitate to contact me directly prior to your next visit, as we hope to welcome you back soon.Sincerely,Andre BroseHotel Manager415-284-4057Andre.Brosestregis.com
1	Great San Fran Hotel. St. Regis are consistently luxurious and expensive. This one is no exception. Small lobby, but great service, beautiful rooms, great workout facility. It is a location that's not overly ideal for the touristy options (Wharf, bridge, china town), but if you want class and can afford it, this is the place.Dear JoesueFree ,Thank you for taking the time to share your review of your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco. I am pleased to hear that you had an exceptional experience at our hotel and that you enjoyed our fitness center and amenities. Please do not hesitate to contact me directly prior to your next visit as we hope to welcome you back soon.Sincerely, Anthony Duggan Hotel Manager 415-284-4057 anthony.dugganstregis.com

The staff is wonderful, willing to help with anything they can to make your stay here awesome. The pool is crystal clear and the hot tub is at the perfect tempature.

1	Conveniently located. This Westin is conveniently located into San Diego's downtown. The room was standard, clean and pretty quiet. The bed was really comfortable and we didn't run into any kind of problems during our stay. However, I didn't like the bathroom sliding door (sometimes it was hard to close) and a vent is really needed in the bathroom. Friendly staff. Marco L - Thank you for choosing the Westin San Diego. I am happy to read you enjoyed your stay with us and most importantly, found our location to be convenient and our beds to be really comfortable. You can't beat a great night sleep in the Westin Heavenly Bed.I am sorry the bathroom pocket door didn't operate properly for you and will have our Engineering team take a look. There is a bathroom exhaust vent in all bathrooms which exhaust to the roof. While you do not hear a fan, the vent is pulling air from the bathroom. We hope we have the opportunity to welcome you back again on a future trip to San Diego. Kind Regards, Alyssa Turowski, General Manager
0	THE BREAKFAST WAS A JOKE. GRAB AND GO. THE WORST BREAKFAST OF ANY HOTEL I'VE EVER STAYED AT. WE HAD TO GO OUT EVERY MORNING FOR BREAKFAST. ROOM HAD DOG FOOD PELLETS ON THE FLOOR. POOR CLEANING OF ROOM. THE VOLUME CONTROL OF THE TV DIDN'T WORK. THE HALL WAY TO OUR ROOM WAS EXTREMELY COLD. I WILL NEVER STAY AT AN EXTENDED STAY HOTEL EVER AGAIN. ALSO, NO POOL.
0	Huge disappointment. Thought from reviewing this hotel that it was a winner! We got there and the room was awful!! it was in need of a facelift! And the square footage was smaller than advertised. A real downer and the front desk team was not helpful at all.
0	Worst experience of my life. At one point I was a loyal repeat customer to this place. Although most would complain about the tacky decor or the dirty burn marked sheets and blankets im not one to make a big deal about it. But until yesterday after I had requested no maid service for my room it was entered by the maid and my stuff... More
1	Enjoyable stay!. Room bathroom were very clean.. Beds very comfy! My room facing the busy Poydras street. Noise wasn't so bad at nite I did sleep soundly but awoken pretty early by street noise..suggest room not facing the street.. There is a happy hour I missed unfortunately as I believe the hours were 5-7pm .. I did make it for popcorn sodas which was great we arrived pretty late.. Distance It is about 2-3 blocks to French quarters .. It really is not far but when your tired and it's 1 am it's far ! Area is safe.. Hotel locks up doors elevator at nite must use room key to get in which I liked felt a little more secure. Hotel folks all very friendly helpful. There is fridge, microwave , small mini hairdryer (not attached to wall) all very handy . Breakfast was ok did the job. Parking pricy 25 plus 3 parking tax! but guess that's pretty standard parking price for French quarters ..
0	Toilet got clogged the first day, we got help on next.... Toilet got clogged the first day, we got help on next morning. Imagine what the family of four with two little kids will go through. The intercom is not working, the best no buttons in the intercom. All buttons are broken. Ice in the cake, sleep with cockroaches!! Our vacation screwed
0	Renovated but not as advertised.. Booked a double king two bedroom suite only to be placed in a king/full suite. Staff was not engaging and made excuses for things that were advertised on the hotels website but not offered. Won't be staying again.Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. While I wish you had a better experience, it is feedback like this that we learn from and use to improve. We work hard to deliver an exceptional guest experience, and it's apparent in this case that we fell short. If you give us a chance to earn back your trust, I can assure you that we will do our best to give you the great hotel experience that so many of our guests have grown so fond of.Sincerely,Priscilla HargroveGeneral Manager
0	Do Not Stay Here!!. Where can I start. We stayed here for 6 nights to have a grandson attend a course at Emory U. Good location not too far from the school, restaurants nearby and close to downtown Atlanta, but the place was a real dump!! The carpet was terribly stained. The kitchen old and outdated and we had to ask for pots/pans and after multiple requests they arrived the next day. There were only paper products, even though there was a dishwasher. After several requests, real dishes were supplied. Then when I went to use the dishwasher there was about 2 of brown water on the bottom. Ugh! No one every came up to fix this our entire stay. No cooking for us in this kitchen. Since we were here for an extended time I needed to use the laundry. Only 1 washing machine worked out of 2 and the dryers were old and rusty and the clothes were snagged on the cracked drum. Only used them out of desperation. There were 3 of us staying here and i had to ask for 3 sets of towels daily (only 2 were supplied) when we got home and were told towels were not available since they were washing towels at this time and would leave 3 sets the next day. One of us showered daily using a hand towel. Each day the situation repeated. When I was packing to leave a cockroach scampered across the floor. if I had seen this earlier in our stay we would have definitely left immediately. Do not stay here!! Management is pitiful!!Thank you for your review. I apologize that we failed to meet your expectations on your recent stay with us. I will address all the negative aspects of your stay with my housekeeping, maintenance, and front desk staff to ensure that these events do not reoccur in the future. Thank you for letting us know and hence allowing us to improve.
0	Rude Staff. The staff at this hotel are very rude. We would never recommend this hotel. The cleaning people do not speak English. Mildew in the bathroom. The weather was cold down there, the staff kept the air conditioner on in the lobby and hallways and would not turn the heat on even after several people complained.
0	Great Staff, but Terrible Money Management. Stay at the Hotel on Main Street.. I booked two nights at the Inn through Expedia however, I was incorrectly charged to my personal card. If this issue had been resolved in a timely fashion, it wouldn't have been a deal breaker however, after the refund of the mistaken charge, I was once again charged on the 29th of December, a full 10 days after I stayed...

0	Called to Cancel. I called to cancel my reservation because I booked in the wrong place. The guy did not understand what I was saying then responded with we charge already before he rudely hung up on me. I needed to book in Thomson Ga and not Thomaston.Sir Sorry You late call and we busy all most full and I hold room. Thanks Sam
1	comfortable room and great breakfast. My stay at the Cabrillo Garden Inn began with very good assistance at check in. My room on the lower floor was good for access and such but being in the corner of the motel resulted in a lack of exterior light and noise from above on the first night. The front desk staff assisted me with moving to an upper level room with an additional window and a king size bed, thank you! The breakfast was great and relaxing on the upper roof level lounge was very cool.Dear Bill S, Thank you for sharing your comments regarding your stay at the Best Western Plus Cabrillo Garden Inn.We hope to welcome you back again soon!Y Chen General ManagerBest Western Plus Cabrillo Garden Inn
1	Grand, Central Location. We recently had a great stay at the Hotel Allegro. Upon arriving, it is like traveling back in time as you are greeted by a grand staircase! The staff was warm and helpful from the front desk to the concierge to the bell man. Although I had the idea that the rooms were on the small side, our original room seemed smaller (and not accurately represented on their website) than I had expected. I inquired about it at the front desk and the lovely young woman who helped me (I am awfully sorry I do not remember her name to give her recognition!) was amazing. She said although it appeared that the category of the room was correct, she said that she was surprised that we had not been upgraded as Inner Circle members. She immediately switched our room to a much larger king suite. We really appreciate this kind of service! The location of the Hotel Allegro is central: in the Loop, walkable to shopping, Millennium Park, and restaurants, block or so from Clark/Lake Blue Line to the airport. We would definitely stay again!Hello!We're so happy to hear that you had great interactions with our team and that were able to get upgraded and enjoy your sweet suite! We look forward to seeing you again soon!Happy holidays!Rachel RodriguezGuest Experience Manager
0	Disgusting! Quality Inn What a misnomer!!!. We booked this room through Hotwire for 1 night. We paid 162. Within 5 minutes of sitting on one of the beds, our son felt a bed bug crawling on his leg. We immediately pulled back the covers and the mattress pad and discovered 2 more bed bugs. Who knows how many others were lurking elsewhere! So, we called the... More
1	Stylish update to an older building in the heart of Union Square. We stayed 2 nights: New Year's Eve and New year's day, and the location was ideal in the heart of Union Square. Saks 5th Ave is a few blocks away, Japantown is a brisk 15 minute walk...Friendly hotel staff, valet parking (35/night) The hotel is a quirky older building (not a bad thing), with dead-end corridors ending at full-height windows looking out onto the street, glass walls looking down into restaurant/common areas. Personality Hotel Group has added a modern sleek look to the whole place. Blue elevator buttons, stainless headboard that peels away to reveal the wall, Artemide night table swing arm lamps, simple modern shower fixtures all add to the industrial chic. The shower was strong, room had complimentary wireless, filing drawer dresser, writing desk, Swing-arm flat screen TV, bertoia diamond chairs, room safe, separate washsink area. Bathroom was a little small and tiles looked like they could use some cleaning and some grout. The bed was comfortable and room was clean, other than the bathroom tiles.Gym was small and a little depressing-blinds were pulled closed to hide the roof fans, gym door probably could have used glass so it didn't seem like you were working out in a prison gym.Business center was nice-I printed out directions to our Sonoma hotel.There is a Starbucks attached through the lobby and a mexican restaurant (we did not try, but looked upscale)Overall, a nice stay in an older building with some decent modern updates.How we got the best rate: 229 New Year's Eve, 129 Jan 1st. After searching around, we got the best rate by booking early on the Diva website directly.
1	Nice Family Hotel. The room was great!! We stayed in an Executive level room. The front desk staff wasn't very friendly. They had a lifeguard on duty at the pool all the time which was nice. The breakfast was very good with a nice variety of foods. It's very convenient to the metro. Free parking at the hotel was a plus. It is the last stop on the metro which at first we thought was a bad thing but ended up being good since we always had a seat in the morning on the way to D.C. Overall, I would recommend this hotel especially for the price. It's also very convenient to the Springfield Mall which is currently closed due to renovation but should open next year.
0	Poor parking capacity. hard to believe that a Hyatt hotel would not have parking for guests - was directed down the street. Ugh. Should be notified on web page of this. Hyatt should consider removing the Hyatt name from this brandRaymond M,Thank you for staying with us at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown. I genuinely apologize for the trouble you experienced with parking at our hotel and appreciate the time you took to write this review. Please know we continue to strive to meet all of our guests needs and expectations. In the future, we hope you will give us another try and find your stay much improved to the last.Sarah Junge
1	Job done Well Marriott. The JW in the hotel name might stand for Job done Well. And it was during my business trip visit to Atlanta. Location, location, location. So convienent to the MARTA transit line, travel from the airport is quick and efficient. Hotel staff and food during our business meetings was flawless. Lobby bar was a bit pricey, and would make me walk to nearby establishments if more than a drink or two were needed. Rooms were clean and well appointed. Beds and linens were very comfortable. Super staff performance at every level.Dear Don W,Thank you for sharing about your visit to JW Marriott Atlanta Buckhead. We appreciate the kind remarks about our service as well as facilities and are glad you could discover the timeless elegance of our hotel, located in the heart of Atlanta's vibrant business, shopping and entertainment district. Thanks again for your kind words, and we hope to welcome you again soon.Best Regards,Eb MbyeDirector of Operations

1	almost great :-). It's an easy walk to all the crazyness of Bourbon Street yet far enough away to be out of the crazyness, just purrrfic for a couple in their 50's. The room was more than adequate except for the fact that my room overlooked Rampart Street so you had a bit of noise of vechiles on the street at night. The hot breakfast was good, eggs, a different meat everyday, waffles etc..A lot of channels on the TV to chose from, we did have a washout day with 7 inches of rain so staying in the room was more pleasant and free WIFI. One thing that is overlooked by even the hotel is their location across the street from Congo Park now named Louie Armstrong Park, what a beautiful historic, clean large sidewalked area to find peace and tranquility, my wife and I spent a few hours just walking and feeding the ducks in the numerous ponds in the park. It was practically empty of people on a beautiful sun drenched afternoon in Spring Staff was also top shelve probably the nicest BW I have stayed at...I recommend it highly.
1	Very nice. Stayed here for one night on our way home from Alabama. Have to say that even with renovation we enjoyed our stay. We reserved a 2 queen bedroom but none were available by the time we arrived so they upgraded us to a king with sofa bed and included breakfast. The sofa bed was actually quite comfortable, my teenage daughter didn't complain. All in all the room was very nice. Breakfast the next morning was very good. Breakfast buffet offered great selections also omelettes and waffles upon request.Stayed on our rewards points so the stay only cost me, 40.
0	Closet Sized Room. Pros: Solid location, cute old fashioned decor (loved the old school elevator, clean, and friendly service. Cons: Unbelievably small room. I mean comically small. My friend and I literally laughed upon entering the room. There was a twin sized bed with maybe 3 feet of room on all three sides of it before hitting the wall. Bathroom was roughly half the size of the room itself. No air conditioning. Luckily we were only staying one night. If we had paid for a room for two and booked this place for a week I think we would have gone mad. It was a corner room so maybe the other rooms are more spacey but regardless the room we were given should be used for storage.Also the breakfast was very poor. Weak spread, ran out of food and dishes/cutlery. I ate cereal out of a coffee mug. Chose that over toast with store bought pastries and cold coffee. If you get room 410 please ask for a different room...
1	Well run, customer-centric mid-century modern motel!. Having visited San Diego before and not necessarily enjoying the Gas Lamp District (with it's chain restaurants and conference going visitors), I was excited to discover the hip Pearl Hotel in Point Lomo. When you tally up it's affordable price, friendly customer service, inviting bar and pool area, and overall design, it's clear you have an excellent choice when staying in San Diego.The hotel is a short five minute drive from San Diego Airport, about fifteen minutes to downtown or Balboa Park, and conveniently located next to a Starbucks, grocery store, and the harbor on Shelter Island. Limited on-site parking is available for a reasonable 10 a night although it's probably best to ask the hotel to reserve a spot for you.The hotel itself is a converted motel with just over 20 rooms situated around a small pool. The main check-in area and bar feature a hip lobby and modern looking bar which also serves as a place to grab a bite to eat in the evening and a cup of coffee in the morning.The rooms while retaining that mid-century motel layout are remodeled with clean bathrooms, a comfortable bed, and a trendy design. A nice twist is that each room features a goldfish which adds a nice human touch. Our first floor room let in a little more noise than I expected from the common areas, but by midnight when staff were tidying up and closing the bar, there was little noise to keep you up.While we did run into an issue during our stay, the staff were extremely helpful and pro-active in making sure we left on a good foot. Had they stopped there, I would still have written a positive review but their follow up call and gesture proves that this is a well managed hotel that truly cares about their customers.On behalf of the entire Pearl management and staff, thank you for taking the time to leave a kind and detailed review! We truly appreciate it. Your support means the world to us. Please come visit us again soon. Tell a friend.
1	Great value, wonderfully walkable location, polite staff, restaurant beyond excellent.. Bad: Worst bartender ever. Long Island Iced Tea missing a few ingredients, King Alphonse was actually a Kahlua and cream with ice. Ugh. In-room coffee machine didn't work, took two days to get fixed, and then made awful coffee. Morning coffee from the restaurant was undrinkable. Thankfully, Starbucks nearby. Good: Best restaurant for dinner of any hotel anywhere. Entrees superb, bread pudding beyond superb. Excellent security staff -- Cheerfully and efficiently retrieved my forgotten keyboard, assured me it was safe, and FedExed it to me no charge. Decor stylish, cozy room made clever use of small space, room clean, rain shower nice. Non-convention type hotel very appealing. Really great value in accessible walkable location.
1	4 star for hotel-neighborhood would get 2 stars. Nice hotel, clean, great staff.Very friendly and knowledgeable about surrounding area.I cam for a work conf at the McCormick downtown. The show provided a shuttle from the hotel entrance right to McCormick place, so that is a big bonus, as I DO NOT like to drive around Chicago anywhere NEAR morning or afternoon rush. The valets were very nice and quick with your car, but 45 per night for parking seems way overpriced. This alone would cause me to look elsewhere, if I were personally paying for a stay. The Taylor street restaurants were many and varied, Within walking distance (few blocks) had a few decent meals there, but nothing to rave about. This area is a little too close to (actually considered) the west side for my taste. While jogging a few miles, it it easy to see the areas that you should not venture into, simply turn around and head back towards the university. Did not eat at in-house restaurant, prices are about what you would expect from a hotel bar / restaurant i.e. overpriced, but convenient.
0	Disappointing. The room seemed clean and the bed was comfortable but the chemical smell of air freshener was so overpowering, so strong that it burned my throat. The television had fuzzy reception. The soap had an unpleasant scent and stuck to your hands. I'll avoid this inn in the future.
1	Friendly and welcoming. We stayed overnight during a remodel of our house. My daughter calls this Westin the American Girl hotel because there is a sky bridge that takes you right to the store. Upon check-in the ladies at the front desk chatted with us a bit and later that evening delivered the sweetest package addressed to my daughter. There were three brightly colored cake pops, some milk and this letter! I was so impressed with the thoughtfulness.Dear cstanush1, Thank you for staying with us at The Westin Houston, Memorial City and for sharing your review. We are pleased to know you your daughter had a wonderful stay with us and liked our warm hospitality. I hope we have the pleasure of hosting you again soon.Andrew GinterDirector of Operations
0	Really a 4. Room is disrepair, rude manager, average breakfast. Possible mold on the wallpaper! I which some was falling off. Plus I've never seen anyone put drywall over wallpaper. At least the breakfast lady was friendly and it was quiet. Do they buy their reviews
0	Why choosing this place. You can hardly call this a hotel. The neighbourhood is dirty! A lot of homeless people on the streets who make a lot of noise during the night! The rooms are very small, there was no service at all. The showers an dtoilet on the floor, so in the morning you have to wait a while to refresh. During my tour in western States thius was the worst experience! The price FAR to high for what you get!Distance to the town is OK. The only positiv thing on this place if you feel good to walk between the homeless. Bottles, dirt etc...
1	Absolutely Wonderful. My wife and I loved this hotel. Our large room was beautifully decorated...with a super comfortable bed. The ambiance of the hotel I would describe as urban chic boutique-style luxury art gallery hotel. The location is wonderful for exploring the charming neighborhood and nearby downtown. The service was excellent. Brunch was delicious in the charming restaurant. Bottom line - it combines a fun, happening atmosphere with a great stay. I doubt we'd look anywhere else in the future. This is the hotel of choice.Hi Doug K,Thank you for your kind words! We think you're pretty great too! We hope to see you again soon.Thanks!
0	Crime Scene. It is my belief someone was murdered in our room shortly before our visit. With red splatter on the wall, table, lightbulb, and curtains along with what looked like a large blood stain dripping down the side of the box spring (I assume the sheets on the mattress kept it from getting as stained) I am conviced something happened. Perhaps... More
0	LOUSY HOTEL!!! DON'T STAY HERE!!!. If I could give this hotel zero stars, that's what I would do. I thought it was really that lousy. There is no breakfast service, the wi-fi is very slow and undependable, and these clowns gave me a hotel room where the phone did not work. They should just tear down this ghetto hotel and make sure all of their workers are out of a job. They should've given me another room, but no. I am NEVER staying here again.
1	Awsome View - Super Clean Room!!. My wive I stayed for one night while visiting in San Diego in one of their Suites with an ocean view. Gotta tell you, we were impressed. Great View, Clean Room, had everything we needed for a very comfortable beach front stay. The Suite with an Ocean view is a Must if you stay. You won't be disappointed!!Thank you so much for the great TA review! It is great to hear you had a good time during your stay and enjoyed your suite and all the amenities.We hope to have you and your spouse back soon. Thanks for spending time at Ocean Park Inn.
1	Brenda is the Best. The staff here is amazing! We arrived at the hotel super early and they were able to accommodate our room needs! The free breakfast was a huge plus, but the employee Brenda topped our visit off! She was very friendly, helpful and kind! She became our friend over the week. The beds are comfy and the rooms were very clean. Next time we're in Orlando we will definitely stay here. Thanks Brenda Todd!!!-Damisha EdwardsDear Damishaae,Thank you for leaving us your positive feedback regarding your stay at our property. It's great to hear that our hotel was able to be perfect for your needs and that we were able to accommodate your stay. Todd and Brenda are a great part of our team and I will make sure that they are aware of your review and are recognized at our next meeting. We hope to see you again soon.
0	Not what I expected.... We came here for our anniversary and booked a spa suite, it took the water 15 minutes to get warm and once it was warm 10 minutes later you were blasted with cold water. We called down to the front desk to ask for more pillows because they fell flat as soon as your head hit them the employee at... More
1	great location. ask for a good view- particularly, you can get one of several rooms with a direct view of the space needle. the prices are reasonable for a big city, and the rooms are fairly spacious. the rooms are clean, and the lobby and common areas are quite nice. a ruth's chris in the lobby is a plus. service is great. this is convenient to pioneer square, pike's place market.Thank you for your comments. We are so glad that you enjoyed your stay with us. It's so great that our amenities and location make it easy for our guests to get to restaurants and entertainment. We would love to welcome you back on your next trip to Seattle.Sarah S.Guest Relations Manager
1	Excellent location with incredible view.. Our stay was made very memorable by the incredible view of the Chicago River this hotel provided as well as a very pleasant stay in the hotel itself. We stayed on the 16th floor with an amazing view of the river. We chose a small room, but it was still well designed and comfortable. Great artwork! We appreciated the free wi-fi and coffee in our room as well. Our room was clean and quiet at night. Jay was very friendly and helpful at check in. Everyone we met who worked at this hotel was very nice. Best of all, is the hotel location! The River Walk is right outside the hotel. It is a great place to run or walk if you want, or to just sit and watch all the boats going by. We walked everywhere from this hotel. Great nightlife, museums, Eataly and Millennium Park are all close by. The restaurant Bella Bacino, located in the hotel lobby, had an amazing kale salad and a lighter Italian pizza that was also very good. There's also an outside patio, too. Also, the Corner Bakery Cafe is just down the street. We definitely will be coming back! This is our new favorite location in Chicago.Thank you, travelbuff101, for your thoughtful review of the River Hotel. I am so glad you were able to enjoy the iconic views as well as our prime location in the heart of Chicago. I am especially pleased to hear your comments about the friendly and helpful service provided by Jay and the hotel staff. I will be sure they see your kind words. We are so glad to be your new favorite location in Chicago and look forward to seeing you in the future.
0	Charged for Extra Night. I've stayed at this property a few times in San Diego. While the doors do not properly fit and the rooms are not the cleanest it was more out of convenience than anything. Three weeks ago I stayed at this property and they charged me for an extra night. I gave them weeks to respond. I have given the management at this hotel and the accounting weeks to respond but they haven't even tried. I've left emails, voice mails, and one person in accounting said they would get back to me. I have now wasted hours on this issue.Thank you for your review regarding your recent stay at our property. We would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. Please know your comments will be shared with the appropriate Department Heads and the Staff for specific training purposes. We invite you to contact us directly to provide us with additional details in order to address your concerns. Thank you.
0	Not impressed!. Was not impressed! We only stayed here because it was close to Disneyland on our last night staying in California. We got in close to midnight. I had called to confirm earlier that evening letting them know that we were going to check in late-that was not a problem. Everyone was tired and just wanted to sleep. The A/C was always on. It did not turn off and we tried everything. Beds were uncomfortable-Difficult to sleep. Woke up to make coffee in our room. Coffee maker did not work.
0	Thinks too much of self, like every diva. In many ways, this hotel is what you would expect from a remodeled urban hotel. Great location, strange room layouts, modern dcor. The room was very clean, and furnished nicely (just not as nicely as the room featured on the website). There were a few issues with my room, some which can be easily remedied, some that can not. First, the shower was poorly designed so whenever it is on water will splash on the floor. The guest across the hall from me requested a shower curtain. There are no built-in shower caddies for soap and shampoo but I found plastic ones with suction cups on the floor of the shower. I thought they had been left there, perhaps to dry after being sanitized. Several times I attempted to stick them on the wall of the shower, but every time they would fall, startling me. The deadbolt on my room door did not lock properly. Every evening the noise from the Mexican restaurant downstairs was very disruptive. It sounded almost like my bed was in the middle of the dining room. I can tune-out almost any noise, but my wife, who is a light sleeper, would've had a hard time getting to sleep. Bottom line, not worth the price.Thank you for taking the time to share this unfortunate experience with us. We are very sorry you did not enjoy your stay. I am not sure if you already reported these issues in regards to your deadbolt and shower caddie but if you have not, do you mind emailing me directly so I can retain your room number and get these items fixed We greatly appreciate you sharing this feedback with us as it allows us the opportunity to improve in the future. Thank you again. Tlaytonhoteldivaunionsquare.com
1	Excellent Location Great Beds. When seen from the outside we were a little doubtful of a pleasurable stay. But once inside our views were transformed. The hotel is very modern with silver/stainless steel just about everywhere. It's also true what they say about the beds, the most comfortable we have every slept in. The staff were very friendly and check in/out was quick and efficient. The only fault was the delay in returning of vehicles from the Valet service but use this as an opportunity to grab a coffee and muffin from the Star Bucks just off the foyer. The hotel is in an excellent location and would hesitate to stay again on return trips to San Francisco.
0	nefasto. Los colchones no son comodos, solo trabajo un elevador, las toallas curtidas, el aire acondicionado no se pudo regular la temperatura.
1	A Courtyard Marriot Really. We stayed from Wednesday to Friday in December 2017. Reservation was made on line. I also had a Friends Family Discount Voucher. Front Desk Rep would not accept it. Stated that the reservation was not made that way Explain Pls Just repeated what was said earlier. The reservations was made correctly with the Corporate Code. All I had to do was present Voucher upon check in Spoke to the Operations Director the next day. She couldn't do it either. And stated you got a good rate anyway I would have gotten a lower rate if they honored it and would have proven that the Corporate programs works. Oh well...Next issue parking fee of 20/night. Other Marriot Hotels waive the fee if you are a Calif. AAA member. Brought it up and was told: we don't do that here Ok, I can accept that. However, parking on property is underground and VERY LIMITED. If you drive in and no spaces, you need to back up all the way out. Had to park on the street both nights (which would have been FREE). Other than that, the room was clean and spacious enough. Closet space was small but adequate for the length of stay. I like the pull out desk/table. The shower soap was smallL. Could not get a good grasp on it. It was not larger than 2 flash drives end-to-end and just a little bit wider. That's it. I kept dropping it. The Bistro/Starbucks in the lobby was not open at 6 AM as posted so no eats if you need to hit the road early...
1	City Break. Stayed here for two nights and had a great time. This hotel has the best redemption for SPG points value, and we took advantage to pamper ourselves. It was really very nice, though one mishap occurred when we were billed for something in the bar that we didn't order. The reception cleared it for us right away without the hassle we may of experienced at some other hotel. We didn't receive the 5th Ave view we were hoping for, but that's only fair when using points. Would definitely stay again.Dear Rose2li, It was truly a pleasure having you as our guest during your recent visit to New York City.On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we are so pleased that you were able to experience our hotel and enjoy the high service and quality levels which we pride ourselves on.Thank you for your time in reviewing our property on TripAdvisor, and please let us know when you will be returning, as we would love to have you as our guest.Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager
1	Off the beaten path. I had made reservations months before. Because of that we got a good price and felt that we had saved 75-100 a night instead of being closer to the downtown area of Seattle. From our searching, we felt it was one of the best deals in Seattle for price and location. The room was clean, good sized. We thought because it was by the Medical Center we would hear sirens all the time. That did not happen. It has a lovely lobby, a dining room for breakfast, lunch and dinner and in addition an outside beautiful dinning patio . The only draw back is they dont have air conditioning. But they do provide fans. Staff were very attentive. We would got back. Bathroom was large. We loved the area. You can get to the Starbuck Roastery by walking. Also straight down the street in front of the inn takes you to the Wharf section of Seattle. It is a pretty good hike or an easy Uber ride. We love to walk and so found it a great neighborhood. They also have a patio on the roof. If in Seattle again we would definately stay there. We were leaving for a cruise and they were very helpful with transportation issues to the docks.Hi Traveler - We're are so glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us! We remain an affordable option for visitors to Seattle. Please consider us your home away from home if (or should we say when) your travels bring you back to the area.
1	Nice Stay Overall. I stayed at this hotel in connection with a trade conference. Overall, the stay was very nice in a clean, mostly comfortable room. Check-in was quick and easy and the staff was attentive and friendly which is typical of most Marriotts. While I do not generally like to eat at the hotel, sometimes this is unavoidable and it was nice that this hotels food and service was better than average. The lobby bar and staff was excellent but a bit loud. The room while fresh and clean had a small bathroom , all of the pillows were too thick for my liking and I had a difficult time finding the right balance between room temperature and bedding thickness. The first morning the in-room coffee maker melted down (things do break) and to the hotel staffs credit, when I called the front desk they offered to send me a new maker and room service coffee at no charge so I would not need to wait as long. Both the new maker and the room service coffee arrived promptly and the room service waiter refused a tip. Its rare that I have experienced such outstanding problem resolution and customer service. Besides the pillows, the few negatives in my view were the very high cost of internet service, especially given the cost of the room, and the airport shuttle. The hotel is a distance from OHare and makes a stop at another property between this hotel and airport in both directions which contributed to shuttles rides with standing room only. Be sure to give yourself ample time during rush hour as traffic can back-up horribly. In summary, these are relatively minor issues and I would be pleased to stay here again thanks to the great staff.Dear Steve1362!Thank you for writing about your stay at our hotel. I am very happy to learn that we were able to make your visit enjoyable. We look forward to welcoming you back some time in the future! Best wishes for a happy holiday season.
1	LOVED this hotel!. We got in late due to car trouble during our honeymoon road trip, and not only did Robert and the rest of the wonderful front desk staff save us a parking spot and greet us warmly, they upgraded us to a suite for our stay! The staff was nothing but exceptional the entire time, the room clean, comfortable and modern, and the breakfast the best I've ever had in a hotel. I would have liked a little more fresh fruit, but the market isn't far so that wasn't a huge deal. We actually added on another day and night because we were having such a wonderful time! It's location is perfect as well, just far enough away to be quiet but close enough that a short walk puts you right in the action of the French Quarter. The only drawback was that our car was hit in the parking lot, and we didn't notice until we had stopped on our way out, so perhaps next time we'll park elsewhere. One low point on an otherwise stellar experience!
0	Dirty Rooms, Careless Management!! They should out of business!!. I checked out and moved to another Best Western in town right after I checked in to this hotel. Checking in experience was very bad, desk clerk was poorly trained. I was assigned to room 159. It was a non-smk room, but has a big ashtray installed right on the wall outside the room door. The room smells so bad, they sprayed so much air fresher trying to cover the smell from odor smoking but made it worse. I found so many hairs on the bed sheet, there's a big area of yellow stains on the sheet as well, I wonder if they change the sheets after each check out or not. I went to the desk checked out, they charged me for the night anyways, without any apologize. I left my phone number for the manager to call me back, one week past, they never call me back. I gave them more than enough chance to solve the problem, but I guess they rather prefer me to share my experience with the public.So, if you don't care about the cleanness, don't care about the service, don't care get you and your family sick, don't care about they will ruin your vacation, go ahead book your room at this hotel!!Dear Sally C.,Thank you for your review, we appreciate your valuable feedback. We've read through your review in detail and are sorry to hear of the service and room cleanliness issues you experienced. It is our top priority to ensure each guest has an exceptional stay and it appears we fell short of this goal during your visit. Rest assured, we will discuss your concerns with our staff to prevent these issues from reoccurring for future guests. Thank you again for your review. Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management Staff
0	sad. I can't believe this was a days inn. I tried to book a days inn near the convention center, and that's the location I clicked, but somehow it booked me at this location. Where to start... no phone, lamps didn't work, sheets didn't fit the bed, patched up tiles in the bathroom to cover holes (and none of it matched), exposed electrical outlets hanging out of the walls, housekeeping didn't clean anything (not even the toilet) during my stay. My rooms door had been pried opened, and hammered back to seal the door, Worst hotel I've ever been at.
1	Was even more beautiful in person!. Loved everything about this place. The service, grounds, room, restaurant, bar/lounge, food was all wonderful. Was really nice having a van that dropped off and picked up from airport, train station and ferry terminal. It was great to just walk down the street and you were right in Old Town with all the shops and restaurant.Thank you for highlighting the service, rooms, restaurant and the beauty of our grounds as the reasons you gave us a glowing review. One of the most complimented features of the hotel is the grounds! For those planning a visit, Ill add this descriptions. There are several patio areas with tables and chairs, fountains and blooming bougainvillea and succulents. The hotels walkways are accented with beautiful tiles. The hotel is terraced giving it an even more romantic feeling. We hope your travels bring you back again this year. The holidays are a special time to be in Old Town if you can make it! Regards,Ryan AguinaldoGeneral Manager
0	Honeymoon Gone bad.. I visited Lodi on a series of times but my experience at this motel was bad. A lot of noise. The Rooms were Ok but not severely clean. I wouldn't stay here again
0	Horrible Hotel/Rooms/Staff. When I arrived at my room it was unlocked. There was a strong musty smell. Being so tired I tried to go to sleep. I woke up not being able to breathe. (I don't have allergies) The hotel was full so I was unable to switch rooms. I asked to check out of the hotel. There wasn't a manager on duty so they refused to check me out. I will never stay at a Ramada facility again.
1	Decent stay in a typical Hampton. Typical Hampton. Better than average room - clean, comfortable furnished well, and quiet. Less than average breakfast - I stay in Hamptons all the time and this might be my LEAST favorite breakfast ever (EXACT same choices two days in a row, no granola for the yogurt, less than usual number of bread options). Average staff. Better than average cleanliness in public areas. Finally, while the location itself is great and very central for many Torrey Pines/La Jolla businesses and even beaches, it was difficult to actually get to the property (dead ends, one way streets and crossing highways with entrances and exits make the intersection a trick to navigate).
1	Elegant get away. Right when we arrived we experienced excellent service. It's a mandatory valet service but it was not too expensive. The hotels courtyard was extremely beautiful (they often have weddings there). The room was very nice and spacious. It included robes and other nice complimentary items. Unfortunately the view from our rooms was not very nice. It was obscured by a tree. The breakfast restaurant at the hotel was delicious and it had a great Buffett that included all the standard breakfast items. I liked that they allowed you to charge your meal onto your room. My favorite part was the beauty of the hotel. Everything from the entrance to the courtyard, to the bathrooms were gorgeous. I highly recommend it. Great for a romantic get away.
0	Dated tiny room. If you are considering a visit to the pacific coast, don't wast your money on this place unless you are wanting to go somewhere to read or write a book. Our family just returned very disappointed. Granted, we are used to sunshine and palm trees, and were mentally prepared for that not being there, but the beach and little town... More
1	Great Locale for Braves Game. We traveled to Atlanta to see the Braves and picked this hotel for its close proximity to Turner Field. It is just minutes from the ballpark! The hotel room was clean and met our needs. All hotel staff were friendly and helpful. The free breakfast was good with hot eggs, sausage and biscuits with gravy. There is a BBQ restaurant close to the hotel that serves decent BBQ. We also ate at The Varsity which is next to Georgia Tech. It is huge and has the world's largest drive in. If you want to save money and are not in a hurry, recommend using the rail/bus system (MARTA) .If flying in, you can take the rail from the airport to the Five Points Station, and from there take the 49 bus. It will drop you off right in front of the hotel. You can use this system to get around the rest of the city, but it can be slow. You may want to use a taxi if traveling late at night, however.Thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey regarding your recent stay at our hotel.Your feedback is very important to us and we can assure you that we will use this information to do everything possible to create an enjoyable experience for each of our guests. We hope to see you again soon!Sincerely,Joya GregoryGeneral ManagerComfort Inn Turner Field Atlanta, GA404-658-1610
1	Solid choice for the area. We stayed here in September 2012 for a few nights. We were on a free roll on the company's dime, otherwise I definitely wouldn't have stayed in the Gaslamp area. Leave the area to those 21-30 year olds. No matter where you stay in the area, the rooftop nightclubs will keep you awake at night.This is a nice property, but might be trying a little too hard to be one of the in crowd. The coolness of the hotel was clearly only skin deep.I give them bonus points for a free and very fast wi-fi connection in the room.If you're okay with the Gaslamp area, I doubt you'll be disappointed with this hotel choice.Hi Cybeerkeg.... thanks for staying with us and for your review. Hope you had some fun in the Gaslamp while you were here at least. It's certainly a fun area, with lots to do and great restaurants. Hopefully you got a chance to explore. Thanks again.
0	Overpriced, loud, and uncomfortable.. This hotel was awful. It was so noisy you could hear EVERYTHING. Lots and lots and lots of kids running and screaming the entire night. Guess it might be good for a family but unless you have wild children it is not worth it. I heard every car outside. One of our pillows had dirt on it. We booked a king bed and got two queens. It smelled weird. It was dated. An elevator was out so it always took forever to go up or down. The parking was cramped and limited. Save your money and don't waste it on this place.I have stayed at nicer Motel 6's.
0	bad breakfast. break fast is an apology of a breakfast..Even ordinary hotels in third world serve better breakfast..
0	Terrible Stay away. Old motel style , recently remodelated but dirty, stinky , stains in the linnens, 1000 year old mattress , expensive ,just not worth it .Dear recent guest,I'm sorry to read your review and hear that you did not enjoy your stay in one of our poolside/putting green area rooms. Although these are only 2-story buildings with exterior access, most of our guests enjoy the patios and balconies these rooms have overlooking the golf putting green or the swimming pool. There are, however, 2 rooms in those buildings that do not have a balcony. I would like to follow up on your stay to check the room and check the mattress. All of our rooms throughout the entire hotel had new premium, Sealy Celestial Plush mattresses put in them, so I would like to go in and check your mattress to see if it needs replacing. I have also forwarded your comments regarding the linens to our Executive Housekeeper. I would really appreciate if you could reply to me at salesholinnbayside.com with your guest room number, or your name and dates of stay, so that we can further investigate this and make sure the next guest doesn't share the same experience.Thank you
0	Would not recommend. This little motel has the attraction of a difficult entrance depending on the direction you're coming from and some very unprofessional employee's, though they did allow smoking in the rooms which was a plus, I woke up the next morning to my car having signs of an attempt of being broken into. Poor security in the parking lot, minimal cameras.... More
0	Don't waste your money!. Absolutely horrible! I was looking for an affordable place to stay for a weekend trip to Watkins Glen and decided to book this place. Worst decision I ever made! I arrived about 10:00pm, had to ring a doorbell to be checked in by a man who came out to the desk in his UNDERWEAR. The room had a musty smell... More
1	Elegant modern rooms in an old shell near Union Square. Hotel Diva doesn't look like much from the outside, but once you step in, this is a sleek, modern hotel, with great rooms, modern decor, excellent room amenities, and superb housekeeping. Front desk staff are excellent, and knowledgeable about San Francisco. The shower is particularly nice. The beds are quite comfortable. 7 minute walk to the Bart.Wow! Thank you for sharing your great Diva experience with us! We are happy to hear you enjoyed our hotel, excellent staff and comfy beds. We appreciate your feedback and hope to impress you on a future stay.
1	Charming inn close to attractions, can see ocean from balcony!. Stayed in room with kitchenette, 2 doubles and sofa sleeper. Quite roomy, cute with patio set on balcony outside room. Can walk down to beach, within 1 block away. Numerous restaurants, shops within walking distance also. Continental breakfast scant, with coffee and sweets, but only negative I experienced there. Kitchen had full size stove and fridge. Easy drive to seaworld and maritime museum. Unfortunately weather was cold and rainy during our 3 days there, so put a damper on our visit. Didn't get to see as much as we wanted to. We loved the maritime museum and harbor cruise and my boys couldn't get enough of the USS Midway museum! I would definately return to this nice little inn!
0	Poor maintenance. Very slippery parking lot. Additional lazy snow removal. No one at front desk (and no sign). Got to room, not cleaned from previous stay. Made me return to front desk, rather than bringing me a key. Breakfast food all out, several tables dirty (no attendant). Think twice before staying here.
1	Fun, easy, and relaxing check-in after a long grueling drive, especially the LA traffic.. Nice and quiet area. Clean room. Good breakfast. Convenient to using the A.R.T. shuttle to Disneyland. Great and friendly staff, Rafael made checking in fun and easy especially since my wife was guest of the day . Lobby needs more space.We are delighted to have been your chosen hotel during your recent stay in Anaheim.

1	Good, but could've been better. We were accommodated last minute on the same night that we arrived in Seattle for an emergency visit and it was a great choice in hotel due to the beautiful rooms and convenient location. The main complaint we had and reason why we'd also reconsider this hotel is the number of disruptions during the night. We were on the 27th floor this time and the stay before that, the 28th and the breakfast club had a toasted fire BOTH times! It was very inconvenient to woken up at 7am and have to run down 28 flights of stairs twice. It was a tough weekend due to the purpose of the visit and after a long day and night that was quite a disappointing situation.It would have been nice to be informed that it was taken care of, but we found that out after 20 minutes of waiting outside the hotel for 20-30 minutes each time thinking it was an emergency evacuation
0	The Worst Drury Accommodations Thus Far. First I want to say we had amazing customer service! They let us check in our bags early, the maid service was great (we tip them, you should too!) the shuttle was on time to the airport and the driver helped us with our bags (tip him too!)However, the heated indoor pool was not on. This is my main reason for choosing Drury, since I have children who love to swim. We were disappointed. The food, another reason we choose Drury, was not edible. There was popcorn made once a day, around 10 am, and there it sat all day. I will stay at Drury again, but not this one!
0	The shades of a past age. First of all, it's a miracle that this motel is still standing and mostly functional. It's very authentic for what it was built for, which is to say cheap, one-night lodging for people driving long distance. But this place is not for everyone, at least. The rooms are spartan, in keeping with earlier times, and not very big. Our room... More
1	Bargain price for a first class experience. We stayed one night after a cruise. The hotel is spotless. There were 2 huge rooms in the suite. The living room had a massive flat screen tv's. The bedroom had a nice 32 We were picked up and returned your the airport by the shuttle and both drivers were amazing.We arrived at 11 am and they rushed to get our room ready. What a great place to relax before our flight home.There is a fridge,microwave and coffee maker in the room. There is also a free bottle of water which I thought was a nice touch. The staff at the front desk were extremely polite and appeared to be well trained.Nice lobby and restaurant/bar. The pool is an indoor/outdoor type and was beautifully heated. Will definitely return.Thank you for taking the time to post such a detailed and wonderful review - we greatly value your feedback and your business. It was a pleasure to make a relaxing day possible with an early check in. Our team members pride themselves in providing first class service and it is very rewarding to read comments like yours. Thank you again for sharing your thoughts and I look forward to having you as our guest again soon
1	great second stay-will come back. second time that I stay in this hotel, and it was great. Great location, within walking distance to both inner harbor and Fells Point, with plenty of bars and restaurants and shopping. the hotel is right around the corner from a couple of great restaurants (my fave: Ten/Ten) and Whole Foods. the staff is always very nice but the hostess at the front couldn't figure out where the rooms with a view of the harbor were, so although she tried to accommodate our request, we ended up with a room facing the opposite direction, looking at a brick wall... other than than, the hotel is great. very convenient bar/snack station in the lobby, great hot breakfast, and fabulous gym (small pool).
0	Never again. The had a bad smell. It smells like wet carpet or maybe mildew.
1	Very nice stay. really nice hotel, lots of stuff around hotel...indoor skydiving, ball park, shopping, food. we really didn't use anything around the hotel mainly because it's not baseball season but would love to come back for a ball game during season. Hotel itself was clean and roomy, the only thing that was a little bothersome was the rooms are a little loud. as with most renaissance, the open space in the center makes for lots of noise, especially during events. we put a towel at the bottom of the door and that did the trick. pool and exercise area were very nice and relatively clean. the location in comparison to atlanta and all of the attractions was a bit of a drive (20 min. or so) but it didn't bother us. i'd stay here again.Thank you for the post! Please come back during baseball season and catch a Braves game!
1	This is my Hotel. Love this place! I stay here often each month. This place is great from the shuttle rides to and from the airport.... the great food from the restaurant.... and the incredible staff! Because, I do stay here a lot the staff have become like friends to me. I always look forward to both Tara and Eryn. They will make you feel welcome and like your a VIP. Make sure you check in early so you can have one of the fresh baked cookies at the desk!Dear Mr. David H,I would like to start thanking you for taking the time out of your busy schedule to share your experience in your home away from home.Part of our job is not just to resolve an issue that it may raise to our guests satisfaction but more important to create a positive memorable experiences every time like is the first time.Here at the Hilton Garden Inn we are all proud of our team members and like you we look forward every week to see and welcome our friends whom spend a lot of their time in hotels and away from home.Please feel free to ask for me at the front desk and thank you again not just for your loyalty but most important your friendship.Sincerely,Alex Blanco
1	Wonderful Location!. I was so pleased when I saw the location and the facilities, however I never knew whether there was a work out room, or what or where any of the amenities were. The front desk people always seemed like they didn't know whether or not to welcome me. We called the front desk one day because the dvd player wasn't working. They didn't send anyone, so I finally went downstairs after thirty minute's to find someone, and it was the doorman that called the maintenance man for me. He came and helped, but could never fix it, so we thought it was our DVD. We spent the last day of our trip traveling back to where we made the purchase, only to find that it was the hotel's dvd player. So we wasted the entire last day of our trip. So I would say that the service was really lacking, but I loved the building and location and price.
1	Good location and good value. Free parking!!!. The room was big and the queen beds were comfortable. There was a good view on Columbus Street. The furniture is not luxurious, but feels solid. The bathroom was a bit tiny but clean. The location is almost excellent: you just have to walk five minutes to go to the heart of North Beach, the italian quarter, full of restaurants and one of the best location to sleep in San Francisco. You can find the best Espresso there.. and a lot of great places for breakfast! (there is no breakfast in the motel). The elevator could a little crowded at morning, if you are in hurry, take the stairs! A nice motel in a great district!
0	The Staff Refused to Honor the Requests for refund. Expedia and I the Purchase of Service Not Rendered and Paid For..hummm What do you Think I bought INSURANCE from EXPEDIA what a JOKE - YOU GUYS ARE FUNNY NOT SO MUCH
0	Baseball Weekend. Location was great. Short walk to the ball park. Lobby somewhat clean. Folks were very friendly. I guess you get what you pay for. Hotel is relatively inexpensive compared to the other hotels in the downtown area but this place needs a serious upgrade. Mold in the shower does not get it. Easy fix but maybe not. No fridge and...

1	Great Location for a San Diego Adventure. Convenient location for access to the highway, airport, and within walking distance to the Gaslamp Quarter for a night out. Rooms were clean, breakfast offered good variety, and the rooftop garden is a particularly nice touch in the middle of downtown. The only reason I wouldn't tell someone to book this hotel was if they disliked hotels with rooms open to the outside. The parking lot, while convenient, was sometimes a tight fit.Dear Lauren H, Thank you for your comments regarding your stay at our property Best Western Cabrillo Garden Inn.We are glad that you have enjoyed the rooms as well as the hotels location and we hope to see you back soon.Y ChenGeneral Manager
1	Excellent Property - Highly Recommended!!!!. My hotel stay at the Hilton Garden Inn can only be described as over the top excellent. I was warmly welcomed by a wonderful front desk clerk named Jennifer who demonstrated exemplary customer service. The hotel was absolutely gorgeous and smelled wonderful - seriously. I stayed in a Jr. Suite and found the room to be comfortable, super clean, and well appointed. My only complaint, and it is relatively small, is that the breakfast buffet wasn't that great especially given the price. When I mentioned this upon check-out I was promptly given a Barnes Noble gift card in an effort to make up for my less than satisfactory restaurant experience. Was I impressed You bet!!!! I have never received such wonderful customer service during any hotel stay as I did at the Hilton Garden Inn. I will ALWAYS make it a point to stay at this hotel each time I visit family in the area.
0	Bad. Power went out due to a snow storm however, partial power was available. Light bulb was burned out in the bathroom though (unrelated to power outage. Hotel is very difficult to find, but the staff were courteous when I called for directions. TV cable is on satellite and most channels were not available due to the storm. Surprising that they're not on standard ground cable. Internet was lost as well due to power issues. Hotel was clean and nice, but dated. Exercise room is small and dated. Bar service was very slow and inefficient. Hotel did a good job clearing the parking lot and sidewalk of snow by morning. However, it would have been nice to have some help to open the sliding doors while carrying all my stuff to exit the hotel, which were difficult to open.
1	Clean, well located, helpful staff. Clean, comfortable beds, nice enough bathroom. Will stay here again next time. Good restaurants nearby. A bar accross the street. Chipottle one block away. EO restaurant two blocks away. Chinatown around the corner. 2 Starbucks one block away. Rent-a-car 7 blocks away. Walking distance to cool places like the Apple store, Market street, etc. This was my first time in San Francisco.I'm thrilled to know you had such a great time during your first visit to San Francisco, Odi! I'm honored to know we were your hotel of choice, and I'd love nothing more than the chance to host you again. Here's hoping we'll be seeing you back again sooner than later!Safe travels,Collins C., Front Office Manager

The hotel is actually a historic property and part of the National Historic Registry. It was fully renovated in 2014 and as such our rooms are in very good condition. I am sorry you did not have a chance to try all the restaurants that are located in the neighborhood. You have the choice of a few Italian restaurants, Greek, Pizzeria, Mr. Cheezious and etc.
1	The Pearl, San Diego, California. My daughter highly suggested this hotel because of the friendly staff, cozy atmosphere and accommodations. She was absolutely right! Everyone was so nice..I have a broken wrist and staff assisted me all of the way with a cheery attitude and smiles (most important because I was a waitress for 30 years and I know all about customer service). I saw other people write that it was a bit noisy. I did not find that to be the case at all. I enjoyed the festive atmosphere even though I was in my room. I LOVED SCOOTER, MY FRIEND THE FISH!!!!!Anyway I HIGHLY suggest The Pearl as a place to stay. They all made me feel like family and I will definitely return on my next visit!Thank you to all staff, from managers to housekeepers!Lorie RoppHappy Holidays. Thank you very much for the great review. Glad you stayed with us. Will tell Scooter the fish hello from you. Hope you will come visit us again soon. pleasure serving you.
1	A little short.... This was the only hotel with a 2 bedroom unit available for our stay with a mother in law. I dont know about the regular rooms but this one is a separate building with 4 suites, each one of them with a living / kitchen / half bath downstairs and 2 rooms and a full bath upstairs. Few details: kitchen was not stocked: no glasses, dishes, forks, knives, pans...so you cant cook. We were not planning to cook but a heads up. There was unfinished drywall work on ceiling, very old inefficient windows and uninsulated roof. Good heat source but very noisy, cant keep it on at night it will wake you up. The room has not been upgraded since the 80s: green carpet, wall paper...just that old beachy CA feel. Service was excellent, so was their restaurant, but we felt that for the price and location this suite needs to be revamped. Worked for 1 night though.
0	Staff was nice. I got stuck staying at this hotel after a delay at LAX. The staff was very accommodating. The room itself was clean but had an odd smell (sanitary smell) and seemed very rundown. The hallways of the hotel are so badly lit they are a bit scary. There was a lot of noise in the room next door to mine... More
1	Perfect!. My experience in this hotel was perfect! Rooms are clean, well-appointed, not so big but privided of all comforts (Tv, coffee machine, bathroom, and free wifi). In each floor, near the lift, you can find a free water dispenser with new bottles and also some chocolates and candys. Every day at 5.00pm, in the lobby is arranged a complementary wine free for the hotel hosts. The hotel is very well mainteined and clean but the strenght point is the position in the city. It is located in the loop (the city center) on the river in front of the Trump tower. It is really close to millenium park and magnificent mile (two of the most touristics place in the city). Moreover the hotel is close (5-7minutes by walk) to the underground line for the O'Hare airport. The staff of the hotel is extremly avaible and ready to meet all you needs. I was in chicago for a business travel so i can't give you informations about costs because i didn't manage the booking of the hotel. Anyway, after my experience, absolutly, I would suggest this hotel for a pleasant and comfortable stay in chicago.Dear Concetta D,Thank you for choosing the River Hotel and for taking the time to provide a detailed review of your experience. We are thrilled to know you found everything to your liking. We really enjoy passing on comments such as yours to our colleagues and thanking them for their great guest service.We sincerely appreciate your recommendation!
0	Spiders in the tub. I was only there overnight, stayed on first floor. Room was small but adequate. Wallpaper falling off the wall in bathroom. When AC was turned on there was an awful musty, moldy odor. Had to turn it off due to my allergies. The next morning I found a HUGE spider in the bathtub. I don't do well with these things but managed to somehow drown it in the semi hot water the hotel offered. Have to say that that traumatized me a little. Hate spiders, especially big ones. I managed to take a shower after that, always looking around me for more. After I dressed I decided to make a cup of coffee in the room's keurig, poured the creamer that is supplied into the cup. It immediately curdled! When checking the expiration date on the creamer it read 8/11/15 and my stay was on 9/5/15. After that I just packed up and checked out. Receptionist at desk was nice but didn't offer discount for the problems I encountered. Only good thing I can say is the pillows were comfy. Checking this dump off my list.
0	Terrible. Absolutely terrible..I was told I was being given a Non smoking room. I walked in and it smelled of smoke with a ash tray sitting on table. Checked in late. Smoke is miserable..checking out as I type. Police were in parking lot as I was pulling in. People walking through parking lot heading back to houses in back of hotel..Avoid... More
1	Beautiful hotel and great value. Bad: The hotel is next to train tracks so there is some noise from that pretty often but it's really not so bad and you kind of have to expect some noise when you're staying at a hotel that's literally in the middle of the city. Good: Very tech friendly as the hotel has its own smartphone app which allows you to order room service and control the thermostat among other things. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. The room is designed very well. Also the price of the mini bar items are actually reasonable.
1	good location. The location in the heart of downtown was perfect, within walking distance of the harbor, seaport, Gaslamp District, etc. The room was very clean and spacious. Downside: charging 49/day to park our car! cwilsonjensen - Thank you for sharing your review with us. We're thrilled that found our location perfect for the needs of your visit. We do offer the option for curbside service Valet with in and out privileges, however there are several self parking options to choose from as well that are not affiliated with the hotel. Thank you again for your valuable feedback, and we hope to welcome you back soon.
1	Business. Hotel is nice and clean staff is very friendly rooms are very clean and big. Micro and ref. In room .we came here on business and parking is OK. Not really a lot of food near here. But what matters to us is friendly staff and size of the room . The breakfast is really nice also great coffee there was eggs and sausage, they had sausage graveyard and biscuits . The sink was didn't work great and Joel maintained guy came right in and fix it give him a 10 .We at the Best Western East Inn Suites wanted to thank you for giving us feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We first wanted to apologize for our lack of eatery, but with our shortcomings we try to make sure we excel with service and cleanliness. We are proud to know that you were satisfied with our staff, room, and the breakfast. We enjoyed having you as a guest, and we do hope that we will see you again soon!
0	Choose another hotel. Traveled to Orlando for a science competition at University of Central Florida. TERRIBLE front desk service, unfriendly breakfast staff. Able to clearly hear street noise, not able to access high-speed internet despite room being close to lobby. Budget-friendly, but wished I had not agreed to staying at this property when proposed by the AAA travel agent.
0	Not near Qualcomm. Trying to navigate that area of San Diego is very confusing, when it says near I am thinking on the same side not over the freeway down some other side street. I guess I was hoping for Next to Qualcomm instead. Well the room looked like I walked into a bad 70's movie, green and orange decor, very stained carpet and flying insects. The room was in need of some serious updating. They tried to make it look fancy with a bed runner. Luckily the bathroom had been updated, it was safe to take a shower. Too bad it didn't match the rest of the room.
0	Not very helpful or friendly customer relations. Poor communication with potential guests.. Called and scheduled a room two months in advance, gave them a card with the expiration and security code to pay for the room so my family who would be travelling without me would be taken care of. When they get there after business hours, they inform my family that they need the card there with them to pay for... More
1	Enchanted!. My husband and I return to Estancia La Jolla every year, on our wedding anniversary, and we wouldn't have it any other way! From the moment we pull up the car into valet, we are treated like a king and queen. Not only the service is extraordinary, one that I haven't really found elsewhere, but the design, architecture and location of the property is truly life changing. The old world charm, the secluded location, the courtyard design, all are just soul soothing. We cannot wait to come back on our next anniversary. It is very much a special and unforgettable treat for us. At the valet, Sean, Chris I, Chris II, were all amazing! At the front desk, William and Erica treated us like family, and at the restaurants, Ashley at Mustangs and Burros, truly a patient and pleasant person, who helped me choose gluten-free items off the menu, and last, but definitely not least, Lisa at Adobe was fantastic! She too, was very knowledgeable about gluten-free foods, and was so wonderful to us, that we were so happy to see her every morning for breakfast. Thank you Estancia, for always giving us a fabulous and unforgettable experience! Looking forward to seeing you all again. Karl and Lilly WilkThank you for a fantastic review! We are thrilled to hear you enjoyed your stay, and thank you for your loyalty. We hope to see you and your husband here year after year. Congratulations, and cheers to another year! We look forward to your return!
0	Door Left Unlocked, Wrong Credit Card Charged. Housekeeping left my door unlocked, and at the end of my stay the staff charged the wrong credit card. The people were pleasant, but if I had a choice between brusque staff who did their jobs properly and pleasant people who did not, I'd take brusque.Paul M,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor.

1	Two bathroom kitchenette suite. Staying over night with a few ladies (co-workers, friends) while attending a multi-day convention. This room was perfect for our needs. A king, a queen, a sitting area with pull out couch made everyone comfortable. Two bathrooms allowed everyone a little more time to get ready for the next day. Kitchenette was convenient to make an instant oatmeal for the next morning. Very comfortable beds. Complimentary purified chilled water near the elevator was a nice touch.Thank you, Chris9767 for choosing the River Hotel. We are delighted to hear you found the accommodations and hotel amenities to your liking. We appreciate you taking the time to post a review and look forward to welcoming you back soon.Kind regards,
1	Small Hotel - Great Location.. The hotel Abri is a hotel that has been renovated very well. The building itself is old but the inside is modern and decorated in a boutique style.I booked this hotel based on the reviews on trip advisor and the location. We were staying in SFR for 3 days so wanted to be close to Union Square, which we were. The hotel room we booked was a suite as we travelled with 2 children. The room was fine, clean, modern. Slightly small, but we were in the room very little so it wasnt a priority for us.The staff at the hotel are friendly and very helpful. Ruben will get anything done for you and always with a smile. It does make the difference to be greeted by name and have happy and helpful hotel staff around you.The hotel has a restaurante and bar attached to it... Open to the public and with a good italian/american menu and an excellent atmosphere.There are 3 things that are worth mentioning I think:1. The hotel only has 5 floors so you will hear plenty of street noise etc.2. The windows are small and the aircon/fan units are noisy. Although we didnt really need them very much.3. There is no breakfast available during the week, but there is room service available from 11am onwards. (there are great breakfast places very close to the hotel - Masons was excellent)

0	Dirty and stuffy. Room was not safe. The door didn't close all the way. It was stuffy and gross. Walls were super thin and could hear everything going on around us. Was not notified that there was breakfast.
1	Great value and good location. This is an old hotel in very good location. A 5 minute walk to Bourbon Street and Harrahs' Casino. A 15 min walk will get you to Caffe DuMonde and the French Market. Although old, the hotel is well kept and the staff is efficient. I found the room a little bit small, but confortable.Thank you for your recent stay at the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans!

1	Awesome Stay-cation. We stayed here for a weekend with some family and had a great time. The hotel was lovely, and the rooms were spacious and clean. They provide towels for both the pool and the beach- a nice treat. The hotel is literally steps to the ocean, and there are plenty of bars and restaurants in walking distance. The pool area has very comfortable lounge chairs and plenty of umbrellas to provide a break from the hot California sun. The front desk staff was extremely courteous and helpful. Highly recommend it!Sarah, thank you for the great review! We are pleased to hear that you enjoyed your recent stay-cation with us. We appreciate you taking the time to highlight some of our amenities and the kind words about our staff. Thanks again for the review and we hope to see you back soon.
1	Nice staff. Stayed here for some training across the street. Stayed in room 139, just 2 doors from the side parking lot. Comfortable beds, nice breakfast area (free for HHonors members). Free coffee in room (Keurig), movie channels on television, fitness center on site. Out the back door is Hooters, more restaurants nearby.Thanks for being our loyal guest and we are so glad you had a great time at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport.

0	If you like breakfast, heat/cooling, and hate bad smells. If you can relate to the title then don't stay here. I will never go back to this hotel again. When we entered the hotel it smelled like a dirty wet mop. The alarm clock in the room was broken, and after informing the manager he did nothing about it. The breakfast was not vegetarian friendly, and the waffles were terrible (raw on the inside). The pillows looked like they we made for very small children, and on the second night the heater went our in the room.Greetings Thank you very much for taking the time to review our property.Your input, and the feedback from all of our guests is vitally important to us and we always want guest expectations to be met upon arrival.We hope to see you again in the future and you can reach us directly at (214) 353-8774 if I can be of any assistance.
0	Not what I'd expect from Marriott. Service was fine but the hotel was worn down: I felt like it was a Comfort Inn. I was on the second floor and heard people above me walking -- a lot. Have to use the neighboring Residence Inn for fitness center. This place needs a remodel . Was it originally a Fairfield I wonder
0	Find another hotel. Over the years I have stayed at numerous Hamptons and been generally satisfied, but not now.We stayed at this Hampton for two nights. Somehow we got into a handicap room. The room was sparsely furnished with only one desk style chair no place to put a suitcase and hooks behind a curtain for a closet. The first issue was the heater which we set at 69 degrees. We went to bed early and at 11 PM woke up sweating to a temp of 84 degrees. Obviously the thermostat did not work. The handicap shower has a vertical slide to hold the shower head but it would not stay at the top nor would the sprayer stay vertical it would flop down. The real issue was a total lack of housekeeping when we returned on the second day. A coffee cup with an inch of coffee was still on the nightstand along with the ice bucket full of water and the bag half in the bucket. I had left it in front of the TV with the lid off so they could see it but they did not move it. In the bathroom there was a little powder on the floor from the morning which was still there, obviously they did not sweep or mop the floor. But the coup de grace was the toilet paper floating in the toilet. That was disgusting, they never touched the toilet to clean or someone used it while we were gone. Overall the hotel was noisy with trains going by during the night an you could hear voices from the lobby. The breakfast was mediocre with a small breakfast area. Look for a better place to stay then here. When I mentioned the issues to the desk clerk she took my number and said the manager would call. Now 72 hours later no call, what does that tell youThank you so much for taking the time to tell us about your recent experience at our hotel. Your feedback we truly appreciate as it helps us to make the necessary improvements. We truly apologize that we did not meet your expectations during your stay with our service.

0	Fire alarm kept us up. I rated low because of the fire alarm that came on at 4:19 in the morning, we needed that sleep because we are expected to perform well at our bowling tournament the next morning.. Our sponsors are not happy with our performance.... We could not get to sleep after that, but we did try, then just when I started to fall asleep again, the alarm came in again at 5:38 (sometime around then )... So since I wasn't offered any compensation,. Not sure if we will return... By the way, your staff is really great!... The food was great, should have opened earlier since the alarms kept everyone up...
1	Solid staff, big clean rooms. 10 minutes from UCF. Attentive staff, good prices and decent variety breakfast. Best price I found on that side of town. For some reason, the signage was down but once we found it, the hotel was fine in comparison to others in that category. Seems popular with work crews but no issues. If youre looking for an upscale experience, youll need to pay 40-50 more. Hello and thank you for the positive feedback. We are so pleased that you have joined us and that your experience was a great one. We apologize that the Best Western sign was not visible, unfortunately the last hurricane took it right down. But I am glad that you found us and that we had the pleasure to serve you. Yes a lot of other working crews do stay with us quite often. They have stayed with us a lot thru the years that we feel as if they have become family. We know them all by name and they know all of us by name. We always like to see familiar faces and meet new guests as well. The staff here is always eager to help and we are always finding new ways to make the guests experiences amazing ones. We hope to have your business again soon and take care. Thank you again for the kind words

1	Characteristic, well-located value for money. First of all If you want 3+ star quality,l don't stay here. If you appreciate value for money, good location and a homely feeling, this is not a bad pick.We stayed 10 days and had two different rooms. First one was nice from the inside but facing a wall from window. Pretty gloomy, so we asked for a possibility to change and had a nice spacious room from 1st floor facing Lombard street. Quite noisy but nice and comfortable. Overall the rooms are spacious, the staff is friendly and it is nice that they give a complimentary continental breakfast (coffee, tea, juice, pastries and fruits). Also as travelling with a small baby they were nice enough to give us a fridge and microwave for free (normally 10/nigth per piece).Downsides are that as it is facing the busy Lombard street it is a bit noisy. Also the AC is extremely noisy and only gives really hot or really cool temp, so it was a bit annoying.
1	Fantastic room with a view!. I stayed here for a couple of comp'd nights and had heard that the rooms were remodeled, so I was looking forward to it and had somewhat lofty expectations. I was admittedly impressed. The room was larger than expected, tastefully decorated, and had a great view of the golf course next door and the mountains beyond. It had a good-sized desk in the corner nearest the floor-to-ceiling windows and a real rolling desk chair as opposed to a more common wooden chair. The internet speed was decent, although I had to call support for connectivity assistance. Cox support got me online quickly. The bathroom was even spacious and had two sinks, a large tub/shower, and roomy toilet area. The whole room was just great! The housekeeping staff was fantastic, getting me whatever I asked for quickly. Check-in and check-out was quick and easy and everyone was cheerful, polite, and helpful! As for the casino, the sports book area was large and not overly busy. There was a limited amount of table games, but the common, basic ones were all there. The St. Tropez Buffet was great for the price and everything was tasty and fresh! If you're looking for a golf getaway place to stay, or just someplace away from the craziness of the strip and don't want to spend a fortune,THIS IS IT! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is for the limited amount of table games. Otherwise, it's 5+ stars all the way!
1	The front desk clerks made this stay very good!. We walked in on a Friday night to book a room after selling our home in Orlando and needing a place to stay for one night before moving on to our new city state. Sharlene treated us like royalty! After learning of why we were staying she offered to upgrade our room with the understanding it wouldn't be ready for a couple more hours - no worries since we were going to celebrate with friends at a local restaurant. Upon our return several hours later Todd was there to assist as well and checked us in quickly with a big smile and great sense of humor. Sharlene appeared and provided gift bags with water a snack which was an additionally sweet gesture. The room was clean and adequate space for our stay and the continental breakfast was amazing! Many choices and all was very fresh accompanied by another great member of the staff to ensure we had everything we needed! They all made an emotional time much better with their friendly smiles, positive attitudes and great sense of humors. We would stay there again when in town to visit friends in that area and recommend to others for sure - great job!!!Dear Tricia M.,Thank you for providing us with your feedback of our property. It's great to hear that your time with us was great and that our staff was able to help make your stay a better one. I will make sure that both Sharlene and Todd are aware of your review and that they are recognized at our next meeting. Also, I'm glad that our property ended up being perfect for your stay. We hope to see you again soon. Thanks!
1	Best Value For Money In Lower Manhattan with a Warm Environment. It's been my 12th-time stay at The Nolitan Hotel, of which I call home away from home. Here is why I keep coming back: 1. The staff is lovely, service oriented and overall great! 2. The rooms are clean, new and made by the best materials and in the exact size, you need for a short stay in the city. 3. The location is by far the best in terms of distance from subway, best stores (Ayr, KOIO, Outdoor Voices, DryBar) Restaurants (Mikakus Sushi, SweetGreens and Jacks Wife Freda)4. By far my favorite hotel in the city!Thank you Daniel for the review! As always we love to host you at the Nolitan! Let us know when you will be back )Best Regards.
1	Staff was super-nice, rooms spacious and spotless.. The staff was very accomodating, even changing our first room to be near my parents' when they arrived. The shuttle drivers, especially Brian, were friendly, knowledgeable and we never had to wait more than a few minutes to either go somewhere or be picked up. When we returned from our cruise, we had 6 hours to kill before our flights. The staff offered to let us return to the hotel, hold our luggage while we used to pool, gym or free internet and shuttle us to the airport when we were ready to go. The gentleman in the restaurant offered to both heat up the noodle cup I bought for my daughter at the snack shop and put the Disney Channel on for her to watch. The folks here coudn't be nicer.
1	Decent cheap Disney hotel. As stated by most folks, the hotel is very dated. However, for the price we paid you'll hear no complaints from me. Saw this hotel online and called to see if they had a military discount. The gentleman who answered the phone gave me the most amazing deal! We got a family suite for the 6 of us for less than the price of a single room. The pool was great for the kids to play in when we weren't at Disney. The front staff was very nice and even let us check in 9 hours early for no additional cost (we drove straight from Washington and were exhausted). The continental breakfast is nothing to write home about, but it was food in the belly before trekking around Disney all day. As 2 families splitting the cost of this amazing deal we were able to have lots of extra money to spend on our week long trip here at Disneyland. We stayed May 2015.Thank you for taking the time to share your recent experience at our hotel. We are so glad you found our hotel a good place to stay. We are glad to hear that your family had a great time and are pleased that you enjoyed so much of our establishment and hope you return for future stays. Sincerely,Jose BedollaGuest Relations Manager
1	It was a really good experience!. We stayed in this hotel or motel, because we were on a budget. And it really served its purpose. We prefered have more money to spend on dinners and on the parks, than to spend it in a hotel room that its only use is to get a good shower and a good night's sleep. It served just that. It was really practical. The staff were REALLY friendly, the parking was really safe, they monitered all cars, to make sure you were their guests. Checking in was a breeze. We were placed on the third floor, and it had a beautiful view to the Island of Adventure's Hulk and Towers. Its your average room, with average bed and furniture. The beds were comfortable, and plenty of sheets and pillows. There is a safe available free of charge, but you have to ask the key in the front desk. The safe is big enough to put your Ipad and documents. The towels could use an upgrade. There is a tv, with local channels. The A/C worked fine and it didnt make any funny noises. We even had to lower the temperature at some point. There is a mini fridge that worked superb! We went to Walmart and bought bottle of waters for the parks and we put in snacks as well. Housekeeping was pretty good some days, other days they just forget to put enough towels. The lighting in the room was pretty bad. The bathroom light sometimes came on, other times we dependend on the light of the room. Another weird detail is that the hotel room key is not your average magnetic key... It worked like a hard plastic card with weird holes. So if you loose that key, it would become troublesome to get an easy replacement. The telephone didnt work, and yes.. No wifi in room. The ice machine does cost you an extra fee, like .25 per bucket... But since we had bottles of ice cold water, that wasnt an issue. We didnt have any hidden fee, and it was a really great stay. Easy to locate and very centric in the International Drive. Close to everything: restaurants, parks, gas stations, outlet malls, cinema. GREAT, GREAT LOCATION!!!! About 20 min to Disney Parks, and 3 min car drive to Universal Studios Parks If you have simple needs, this is really your place to stay! Would recommend, and would stay again in a heartbeat! :) great christmas vacations in Orlando.
1	Army ten miler weekend. I was really pleased with the choice I made to stay at this Best Western. I needed a place close to the Pentagon and this hotel was not more than 10 minutes from the Springfield-Arcadia metro stop and right off of route 95 so it was the perfect location! There were plenty of restaurants nearby and the staff at the front desk were extremely nice. The only problem was that our room was right next to the elevator and we were awakened more than once during the nice by some loud guests. Other than that, I was satisfied with everything else including the price.
1	helpful staff. the hotel itself was ok, but from my past stay I can say its improved. dena was very helpful in every way she a great asset to your company. she made my stay very enjoyable. Mirlanda as well, very sweet young lady!! I would definatly come back especially if their workingFirst, I want to thank you for choosing the Best Westrn East Inn Suites for your recent stay. I am very fortunate to have a great team to work with. They are truly what makes this hotel great. I will be sure to recognize Mirlanda at our next greet. Hope to see you again.
1	Excellent value for money!. Me and my partner stayed at the Motel 6 Downtown Atlanta beginning of september 2015. We were visiting Atlanta for a couple days as we were on route to Fort Lauderdale and slept 2 night at the Motel 6.The Motel 6 is excellent value for money! Rooms are clean with a nice bathroom. Our room also had a small balcony where you can relax in the morning and evenings when it is not to hot outside...Check in staff was very polite and check in went very smooth. Also a plus is that you can get free coffee at the reception area every morning from about 7am. That is very easy when you arrive 'jet laged' from Europe and wake up much to early each morning -)Location of the Motel 6 is perfect because you can do all the tourist places like the Coca Cola museum, the Olypic parc etc by foot.They also have a car park at site at no extra cost, so that was also very easy to park our rental car there.Overal the Motel 6 downtown is a basic but very good motel in downtown Atlanta with clean rooms and friendly staff. I will surely stay here again when visiting Atlanta!
0	Not again. The room was supposed to be a non smoking room yet the smell made it clear that previous patrons had smoked and more than just cigarettes. There was a cigarette burn on the wall above one of the beds. The overall condition of the room was disappointing especially when it cost 80.80 for a one night stay.
0	Disappointed, not up to usual Best Western standards. Unfortunately, this Best Western was quite a disappointment. Luckily we were only here for one night on our way back home from a west coast rad trip. I completely understand the lobby is currently under construction, but the alternatives are not very clear.

1	Good. Good customer service , room clean, quiet , nice are but one thing difrent information on site than what they give you on the phone. Just need to be careful next time. And have a little more smiling workers.Thank you for choosing our property for your most recent stay. I appreciate your feedback and I'm glad that your stay was enjoyable.

1	Good corporate hotel. This is a good hotel at the upper end of the business travel market. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. It is very convenient for a major shopping centre which has several high end department store anchors as well as a fair scattering of designer shops.The rooms are nice with all the standard amenities. There was just one thing that was wrong and it is not a fault of this hotel alone. During the night the guests in the next room arrived back in and conducted a very loud conversation. The sound proofing between the rooms was non existent. I am sure this hotel was built during the 70's or the 80's and has since been refurbished, at this stage the sound proofing should have been improved. There are always communicating doors between bedrooms in this type of hotel and I wonder how often these are actually used.
1	Good Hotel with a view. We stayed at PSI for 3 nights in Premium room 33. The view from the room was spectacular even though it was partial ocean view but it was so soothing to sea the ocean and waves from your bed.Theres a table and chairs outside the room to enjoy the view while having tea/coffee. The hotel is just a minute walk to the beach and few minutes from the pier. The breakfast was just ok with muffins, croissants, tea, coffee and juices , just for takeaway as theres no place to sit and eat. The only thing that sucked was the WiFi . It really took hours to connect. Overall its a nice place to stay. Would stay again if they improve the WiFi quality and the breakfast.
1	Labor Day Fun. Stayed for three nights at the Grand Hyatt over Labor Day Weekend. Originally booked on the 29th floor in a beautiful room. As stated in other reviews, the bathroom is almost as big as the bedroom... which is really great. Spent a lot of time in the tub!On the second day of our stay, the room next to us started sounding like a night club... around 4pm! After a quick peek, we realized it was a group of kids for Prom. Rather than deal with them later in the night we called downstairs and were moved immediately to the 26th floor. The room was slightly smaller, but definitely quiet! The staff was VERY helpful in our transition to rooms and the entire ordeal was over within a matter of minutes.The Grand Hyatt is very conveniently located to shopping, restaurants and the waterfront. We rented a car from Enterprise, which is only 4 or 5 blocks from the hotel. Seattle was wonderful and so is this hotel!
0	Not great. We just stayed for 4 days as we were in town for a wedding. Great location but will say that the room smelled moldy, my shirts wrinkled from the humidity in the room. But the worst was that the rug was so dirty that the bathtub hard dirty footprints on the base when you would get in. We would hop around or wear socks...On behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you gave us to implement improvements to ensure we offer a better experience for guests in the future.
0	Very Poor. There were no restaurants in the hotel open on Saturday night. I had to go to the Gift Shop to eat chips, candy, for supper. I had no car. You should have a shuttle service to Love Field for pickup. I had to beg for a ride to take me back to Love Field on Sunday morning. I do not recommend this hotel at all.
0	Worst place ever!!! Save your time and money!!!. I don't even know how this place is still operating. The girls at the checkout desk are rude and confrontational. Their faces depict people that are being forced to work... Not helpful whatsoever. Unprofessional! Checkout took for ever and they don't know how to explain things. The AC in some rooms don't work. Please send those ladies to customer service... More
1	More than expected!!!. Ok, let me start by saying I do not care for hotels so it's rare that I'm impressed by one. I recently visited the New Orleans for the first time the weekend after Mardi Gras. We decided to walk around before checking in and it became late in the day. I received a call from the hotel manager who called to let me know they would still hold our room for us. I thought that was very nice. We arrived at the hotel and I was skeptical when I saw the outside of the building. My boyfriend reassured me that inside was probably much nicer and most buildings in New Orleans look like that on the outside. I was amazed from the moment we stepped foot in the lobby!!! The staff were courteous and the room was more than clean. I always inspect the bed and the shower upon entering my room and I couldn't find ONE thing to complain about, which is very rare lol. We also went down to the 5:30 Kickback where the hotel provided free food and and drinks. Overall, our stay was well worth every penny spent!! I have to say this will be my hotel of choice from now on whenever I visit.
0	It is what it is.. The facility was not bad for the price the room was clean, beds were good and everything worked. The people that stay there however were unpleasant to be around.On day1my girlfriend could not walk out of her room without getting harassed by a gentlemen with his pants on the ground so she had to be escorted every time she left the room. The same group partied till 5a.m. and our room wreaked of the weed smoke from the room next door. Day 2 there were several ferral children running around some naked all unattended while parents chain smoked Pall Malls on the steps. Again the facility was nice ,it was clean and was not bad except for the other guests.
1	Great Hotel. We stayed at the Orchard Garden Hotel for three nights during our California vacation and had a wonderful experience. The hotel is located just outside the gates to Chinatown and we were able to walk to the Embarcadero, Pier 39, Coit tower, Golden Gate state park, etc. The rooms are a little smaller than other hotel rooms we've stayed in however the bathroom was quite spacious. I am very particular about cleanliness and this hotel was clean, new, and well run. Comfortable beds and pillows, free movie rentals! The only thing missing would be a nice hot tub on the roof! I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are staying in San Francisco!
0	Mediocre. I stayed for a combination business/vacation trip with my parents. The location was convenient to the highway, but a long (if doable) walk to the main Seattle attractions. The lobby was nice. Breakfast was good, and the breakfast staff was nice. The room itself was pretty mediocre. I noticed mold in the bathroom, and the carpets were old. The room could have used more storage/drawers for clothing and personal items. Front desk staff was pretty bad. They didn't seem particularly willing help me when asked. My parents stayed a few days later and had terrible customer service from a front desk employee, so that has further detracted from my opinion of the hotel. I would not stay here again.I'm very sorry to hear about your disappointment with our service, Christina. That's not the experience we strive to provide our guests, so I'll be looking into what went wrong during your stay so it doesn't happen again.Regards,Frank F., General Manager
1	A very good hotel. I found the Orchard Garden an excellent boutique hotel in San Francisco. The only reason why it doesn't get a 5.0 rating is the ambience, which I found a little sterile.It is a LEED-certified hotel, which means it follows environmentally-friendly practices in its energy management and overall business practices. If this is important to you you should stay here. You will not be disappointed by the quality of the experience.The rooftop garden is very nice although I wish it had a bar. You can bring your own up there and we did and enjoyed it. I'm surprised more people weren't up there. The location is excellent, northeast of Union Square makes it even more walkable to North Beach and the waterfront as well as Chinatown (next door).The room was very clean, excellent and very comfortable bed. Didn't eat in the restaurant so I can't comment on it. Breakfast was included in the rate and was good if not spectacular. The modern decor and light colored woods I thought were just a little sterile looking. That's my only complaint. I'd certainly recommend it, however.
1	Great hotel for the low price. My husband, baby daughter and I really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. You are in a great location near all the restaurants and shops and you cannot beat the price! The beds were not the best quality but were comfortable. I liked the fact there was a microwave and mini fridge in the room. It is not the fanciest hotel to stay in but it met our immediate needs and was very accomodating for a weekend trip getaway with my family. The gentleman at the front desk was very friendly and courteous too. When we return to the area we will come back to this hotel.
1	A steal in San Francisco! Look no further. Don't let the outside looks fool you! This might be a motel kinda of place but the owners did a fantastic job renovating it to today's standards. Check-in and check-out was a breeze. As we got there late evening, they helped me locate a parking spot within the property. (review of parking to follow so keep reading)We got a 2 queen room and it was much bigger than I expected. There was plenty of room to roam around without feeling cramped. Everything was clean and well appointed: big flat screen TV, microwave and fridge, coffee maker, iron, closet. Beds and pillows were very comfy. There were also TONS of outlets (including usb) to charge all your electronics. Bathroom was just the the best. It is an open tiled bathroom with the most amazing water pressure ever. It felt like getting a massage in the shower! They offered a light breakfast but we didn't try it. Plenty of really good restaurants less than 5 min walk away with a lot of choices (italian, japanese, brunch, veg/vegan, chinese, mexican, you name it.) Although parking is free at this hotel, the parking lot is limited and a bit tight which can be unnerving if you drive a big truck. We were lucky to get the last parking spot on our first night (it looked like they were sold out and parking lot was full) But did I say it was free :) Just park the car and take the bus. There is a bus stop less than 5 minute walk away. It was a 20 min ride to the Wharf and also 15 mins to Golden Gate Bridge Visitor Center.On the down side, it can get noisy as it is just off the street and you can hear cars pass by. It didn't bother us too much though and we still got a good night sleep. If you are light sleeper, just be aware. What a lovely review! Thank you for taking the time to go into so much detail to demonstrate how happy you were. You had the experience that we want to provide for each and every one of our guests! We are delighted that our property was such a wonderful match for your accommodation requirements, and we hope to welcome you back again soon! Best wishes, Hotel Management
0	Only a parolee could love this place.. I did not feel safe at this hotel. Their shuttle took forever to arrive at the airport, took 2 calls to find out where they were, and was so old and rickety I couldn't talk on my cell phone. The lobby night club attracts an unsavory crowd and people are lurking around everywhere. The halls are dark. The front desk is covered with graffiti and the staff couldn't answer basic questions. My room furniture was covered in vinyl upholstery with lights around the bed. Everything is painted black. The bathroom needs a total make-over. Somehow they thought I'd be fooled by a new shower curtain. I didn't even consider eating in the restaurant. If others liked this hotel, I'd question their taste and travel experience. This is not a place for women or children! Leaving was like an escape.We are sorry that you didnt enjoy your recent stay with us. We would like to apologize for any issue you may have experienced and kindly inform you of a few up and coming renovation projects. Our bathrooms and are one of the last phases of our renovation and will be completed over the next 6-12 months. We are changing names to Wyndham Garden over the next few weeks and a few decorative items will also be changing during this transition. We are alarmed to hear you had a poor experience with both the front desk and our shuttles especially since every vehicle in the fleet is no older than a 2012 model. Our restaurant is fantastic and very well known in the area, were sorry you didnt have a better first impression and the opportunity to dine with us.
0	Not a fussy traveller... but would NEVER return here. Ok.. before I start the review - Can I just say that I always stay at budget hotels and never really have any issues.The continental plaza is by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. We arrived on the 23rd of December and Natalia was on the front desk, probably the best member of staff that they have, and we had to change room 3 times due to the disgusting smell. We settled on room 408 (top floor and has a view of wet n wild and Universal-one of the only good things about the place.) One way i've been describing this place to friends is for them to think of 'my name is earl'. Basically you enter the room on a balcony and the outside wall is 1 big window.. so you can't leave the curtain open at all if you're in the room! There isn't a window to open either .. so the only way to get air into the room is with the air con which is loud! The rooms smell of damp and the closets have mould patches on them. The cleaners didn't clean the rooms on a daily basis even though the latest we left was around 11am (we even left some crumbs on the floor to see if they hoovered, but they were still on the floor for about 3 days). The sheets smelt weird and im pretty sure the top cover has never been washed! The hairdryer didn't work... there was no Iron in the room although there was an ironing board! The Safe didn't work at first! There were weird brown stains on the bath. The Fridge was so cold that everything we put in there was frozen solid by the next day. Some of the good things- 15 min walk to Universal Studios, Wet n Wild over the road and and iride stop outside the hotel. BUT there are so many hotels close by and you'd get these benefits and a nicer hotel! If this hasn't put you off then you'll have to learn the hard way! We had to and stayed there over Christmas! we even booked a night at a different hotel for 1 evening! Don't do it!
0	Second chance stay. The hotel was alright, this was my second stay at this hotel after my first experience I recieved a comp night to get a better experience. My second experience was about the same, rude staff, bugs in room, room wasn't cleaned when asked and many other things to add on this. For the price of the nights I did pay for, it would be been better to go to another hotel with more comfortable beds. Thank you for your candid review. Upon checking out on Sunday, our Guest Services Manager asked you if your stay was enjoyable, you told him that everything was fine. You certainly didn't mention any of the complaints you list here. We also noted you called for Housekeeping Service to remove trash and bring up fresh towels to your room in the early afternoon on Saturday, declining a full service. Upon reported completion of that task, a Courtesy Call Back was made and you told our Guest Services Agent that everything was delivered to your satisfaction. It's disheartening to read that you had complaints only after you left the property, even though attempts to verify your satisfaction were made by the staff here and, at the time, confirmed by you. We thank you for giving us another opportunity. We sincerely hope you enjoyed your time in New Orleans. As always, if we can be of any other assistance, please don't hesitate to contact us. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Managercasey.callaiswhitneyHotel.com
0	If you can afford it; book another hotel. The only good thing about this hotel is the proximity to Kings Dominion. I will be driving to the park next time. The hotel is right next to the highway, which for me is a security concern. The staff was not overly friendly. The room is a bed and shower, not overly nice, or clean. If you are looking for a place to sleep and shower only (not your most comfortable stay) OR cannot afford a nicer hotel this is the place for you. Although the attached Denny's is convenient, it is dirty and we were served cold food. Hope this helps make your decision.
0	Uncomfortabe stay. This hotel has accomodate some custormers with too noizy in the later night and has no isolation of noizy. The narrow room is poor to install the old air condition, but charge average 70 dollar per day.
0	Poor housekeeping. Housekeeping did not clean my room. Trash was left on table and in trash can. Bath tub was visibly dirty and was not cleaned at all. Beds were made up but one bed was made up with a dirty comforter. I called front desk and they told me to put trash outside of door and someone brought a comforter and... More
0	Good Hotel But Needs to Take Care of Guests. I want to emphasize that the problems I describe here were dealt with by the overworked night staff (desk manager and shuttle bus driver/handyman who went out of their way to solve the problem of our room. I have stayed in this hotel over the years but this was worst experience and perhaps the last time. It looks as if management has cut staffing to the bone. At hotel desk I waited for nearly 20 minutes. The clerk was with a guest of the hotel who had a problem. The guest explained the problem at least five times the clerk kept forgetting details -- because he never wrote anything down -- instead repunching the same mistakes into the computer over and over again. No one else came out to help and he kept repeating mistakes. The guest, a businessman, was very patient and stepped aside to let me check-in. The clerk finally got to me. We loaded up a baggage cart and went up to the sixth floor. We found a nice room at well over 100 degrees. It is seemed as if policy is to completely turn off air conditioning between guests. Downstairs lobby was cool and pleasant. Upper level lobbies and room were very hot. Room faced afternoon sun directly unshaded. We set the AC on cool hoped for the best. I went downstairs to use the business center which is a computer in an open area with children playing on it. A child got up but no obvious reset function for privacy and screen faced a group of children hanging out. Hotel also needs to reduce loitering in parking lot.
0	Shabby. Sadly in need of total facelift. Not so clean, beds comfy but in need of linen update. Old TV. Kind of felt like I needed to check for crawlies. You get what you pay for. Would not return and would not recommend.
0	Very close to Disneyland but.... The experience here was less than satisfactory for many reasons. Firstly when we arrived with our rental car at about 4pm tired after a 15 hour flight and the need to fill in the day till check in time at 3pm, we were astounded to find the hotel completely roped off with no way in. Seems the carpark which... More
0	So disappointed. We have just arrived and are so upset that our stay is here. We also booked with 3 other couples so finding a hotel that can take us all seems to be impossible. The bed is soft and lumpy. The phone another guest described as all the buttons were broken and the hotel responded they remedied it must have been placed in our room. I signed a waiver I'd pay a fee if we smoked in the room. I hope the previous guest was charged because the room stinks. When I booked last October guests reported renovations going on. I thought by July it would be completed. They are still renovating and the hot tub is closed. Our kitchen looks like the material was saved from the 70s. One review said hotel will be nice when renovations are competed written in 2012, 3 years ago. Sad start to our vacation. Front desk staff said she's the only one here doing the best she can. No room changes available and no service.Cant sign in to wifi and shuttle service advertised is limited.Dear Sir or Ma'am,On behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for failing to exceed your expectations. Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you provided to make improvements to ensure we offer an exceptional experience for our guests in the future. I'd like to discuss your stay further so issues can be addressed directly, but I have no more information available to me.

0	Definitely Not Worth the Money. Not enough pillow, dingy shower curtains, bad TV reception. TV mounted in location that it hard to view television. Room almost 100.00 dollars, not worth it, will never stay there again.

Staff were not sympathetic after our train trip had turned to custard and we hadn't showered for 60 hours, we arrived about 11am to be told us no way can you get into your room early, 3pm is check in time okay fine we went away and came back a 3pmOur last evening at SpringHill we (all the 15 NZer's) decided to have dinner at Hotel, but were told can't do it, should have booked, the Manager got us into dinner a short walk away.Then we got back to New Zealand 2 weeks later the account was charged to our credit card when it was already paid for by our travel agent (who just happened to be travelling with us) Had the staff listened to instuctions this would not have happened.

0	I love this place, except. It's always so hot in the rooms. I stay down there every 3 months or so for medical appointments, and always loved it. The architecture is really cool, and it's close to where I need to be. I haven't stayed there though due to their heating and cooling being out of whack. If it ever gets fixed, I would be... More
0	Don't Waste Your Money. Very old hotel that caters to low class clientele. Being near Disneyland, this hotel is a fly trap to families who cannot afford something nicer. There were children running around all hours of the night and day and the hotel staff did nothing to keep them quiet. Our first night there we had a family above us with small children who kept running around the room and because of the noise we assume they were jumping off the furniture. We complained to the hotel staff and nothing was done to stop this. It continued until well after 11 PM and night.The second night we were there, we had a family with small children next door to us and it was apparent from what we saw, they were there with other families who also had small children. They were kept there doors open and the children were running up and down the balcony with no supervision. At 6 AM the next morning, someone was pounding on the door next to us very loudly and yelling fire, fire, fire. It woke up the people next to us so they opened there door and began to play loud rap music until about approximately 9 AM when we left. We were on the second floor near the office and all of this activity was extremely loud and had to have been heard at the office, but no action was taken to stop it.I would never stay at this hotel again!!!!Thank you for taking the time to write us a review. We are extremely sorry for the experience you had at our hotel. This is not something normal. I am also suprised our staff did not address the issue immediately. W hope you will give us another chance in the future to win back your business.
1	Would say excellent except for expense. For the second time in three months I booked a Marriott despite unfavorable Tripadvisor reviews and found the reviews to be wrong. This hotel had fantastic staff, a very good restaurant and room service, and the perfect location. Nice size rooms and bathroom. Good fitness area and a safe walking area. I walked all over the area day and night and felt safe. Taylor Street has great restaurants, it is Little Italy. I never had to use a cab as I walked to UIC and dinner. So, I saved a lot on cab fares and maybe that helped offset the expense. The room rates are high, above 325 for two nights and 265 for two nights. Also, in contrast to other reviewers, Gold and higher get free internet, free breakfast. Shuttle is free for one mile. Internet is weak on end rooms. Again, expensive but sometimes rates are lower. If you need to be in this area and can afford it, stay here and you will not be disappointed. If the expense bothers you, find another place, cab everywhere you need to go and see how you feel. I liked this place and will be returning.
0	Clean place to stay for a night. Clean reasonable place to stay.We payed around 70 per night. Free wifi, free parking, free microwave and refrigerator. No Frills, place needs a little upgrade, but ok for the price we paid and booked it at last minute.
0	Horrible. I have never been treated so badly in my entire life. I have called this people so many times to ask questions regarding friends comin over for as me have in a lil get together. An every one of my questions where answered wrong cause they made it a point to ruin my night. My friends where not allowed to go to the public bar or swim they told me on the phone the was open til 11. once we got there they said it closed at 8 I guess it was cause we where black an they thought they where talkin to a white person on the phone. They said my guest where welcomed once they got there they stopped them from comin up once again guess it was cause we where black. I will never return to this hotel from hell again. An also they let people order drinks under your room number wit out gettin permission from the person the room is from wow is all I got to say.Dear Sasha, We strive to deliver an exceptional experience for our guests at NOPSI Hotel, but this evidently did not occur during your visit. We take very seriously any complaints of discrimination, any forms of which are not tolerated in our company. As the hotels General Manager, I welcome the opportunity to discuss this issue with you, and also address and clarify your concerns regarding pool usage and rooftop access. My e-mail address is elemairenopsihotel.com and you can reach me via phone at 504.962.6512.Warm regards, Ellen LeMaire
1	Great to be back and still the best!. Always a pleasure staying at my home away from home in Point Loma. As always, Marcella, Jamie, Emily, Erika and the entire staff provided seamless, professional service throughout my entire stay. Jon and Jason have the restaurant back on track after Aaron's departure. Service in the bar restaurant from Chloe, Vahn, Paul and Linsday was outstanding as always!! The new general manager Kimberly is working hard to keep things wonderful as well --- thanks to everyone for all the congenial service and extremely positive and customer service-focused attitude!!Thank you very much for the kind review. 2nd review!!!!!. it's guest like you that make this business so amazing. we appreciate your continued support. always great to have the mayor of the Pearl on property.
1	Exceptional staff, okay hotel. The location of this hotel is fantastic and the staff go above and beyond to make you feel welcome, starting with registration all the the way to housekeeping. I stayed here for a conference and the meeting facilities were also great. The food was to die for and it seemed like it was never ending! My room was on the 15th floor and was very comfortable. The king size bed was cozy and I enjoyed having the option of separate bath or shower. The only two things I wasn't that jazzed about was the room rate (400ish per night -- and that was discounted) and the decor seemed a bit dated. All in all it was a good experience and I would stay again!Dear KikiB228,I'm so glad to hear our staff took great care of you during your stay and that you enjoyed our hotel. :) Yes, San Francisco is expensive and I know the rates can sting a bit sometimes. If you come back to visit us check out our website as we have specials and packages that may offer better value to you! Thanks again for the great review and we hope to welcome you back again soon!Sincerely,Danielle OrtegaMarketing Manager
0	never,never,never. 1-now it is two months that they are constructing while they are renting their rooms to customers. you are tired and you are sleep while the workers are working with big saws and non-stop hammer sound just near your room. they must close the hotel while they are under construction. but the greedy owner installed a plastic in front of workers area and rent other rooms to poor customer with nonrefundable policy!!! you are sleeping in a construction site. the sound of construction make others crazy and have to leave hotel in rain or while you are sleepy and must walk in street until worker stop working. the greedy owner who is afraid of revenge of some angry customer and destroying of some facility of hotel because of this tricks of owner,impel all of customer to give her a deposit or credit card charge for probably damages to room!!! she charge you when you reserved your room with a nonrefundable policy because she is sure you will demand for refund because her hotel isn't live-able.she only think to money of customer and after charge of your card no service and non-refund and a lot of problem. 2-internet connection is always disconnected. 3-every floor only two bathrooms,you must wait for a vacant bathroom. 4-even you must negotiate a lot for a simple tissue. 5-no elevator,3 floor. 6-no telephone in rooms,with no elevator you must to come down by stairs for every simple inquiry. 7-wooden and thin walls,a lot of sound of sex and argue of others is in your head. the owner is oppressing others by renting this rooms.8-no air condition9-scream of complaint of others make you angry.10-so dirty rooms.11-reception has no authority to solve problem of customer,for every thing they must call owner and describe whole of story while you are waiting.in most case you only hear that(this is policy of owner).12-outside of hotels there are a lot of vagrant gays,we always start to run and went inside of hotel rapidly,very bad location.wow I became crazy in San Francisco because of this hotel.I cant believe in USA something like this.oh no.
1	Met our needs. Just got back from a two night stay at Hotel Felix and have no complaints. Check in went smooth and every employee we encountered were very friendly and helpful.Yes, the rooms are very small, but they were extremely clean and the bed was very comfortable. We weren't there to spend alot of time in the room. I will say that the sink was the most shallow that I have ever used, but like some people said, the place is very hip.You can spend an extra 100 a night to get a bigger room and fancier hotel, but it was just fine for us and would definitely consider staying there again.
1	Good choice for those on a budget. This hotel is not within walking distance of the downtown Napa restuarants and shops, but it is within walking distance of several chain restuarants, stores and a movie theater. It served us well since we had a car and spent most of the day exploring the vineyards. They offer cereal bars, juice and coffee in the morning and you receive a discount at the Dennys next door. We would stay here again, mainly because of the cost benefit.Gregory K - Thank you for the great review. We are thrilled you enjoyed your stay and please come see us again soon!
0	This hotel is a dump. We had a reservation for two nights but stayed one and wentto a decent hotel. The room furnishing looked like the stuff that yourlocal thrift store would discard. Don't waste you money going to this DUMP. There's a decent Holiday Inn for the same price close by.
0	won't again. The sink kept backing up. The bathtub leaked. There were gnats flying around i think because of the clogged drain. The air I on 60 degrees and it never got cold in the room before it would cut off for very long periods of time. Went in the pool night before we left broke out the next day all over. Jacuzzi was nice. room 118 beware
0	Check your bank statement!. I will start with the major issue. This Best Western has no staff that reads of que. It is almost as if they are responding by a written list, like a customer support rep from India would. They repeat the same answer over and over rather than trying to listen to you and work on something. I stayed for a week, and during the week I complained that what was supposed to be a queen bed was not. IT was clearly not a queen bed. I am not stupid, I sleep in a queen at home. But the staff was insistent. The manager offered me 25 off per night, which I accepted. But here comes the major issue. On the 13th at departure my card was charged, and the charge approved by the bank for the total bill with the discount. In the next two days a second charge for the exact same amount, but as a different transaction. The accountant Ms. Loupe like all the staff there insisted this is normal, it's just a hold of funds. What funds You already got the money, it's gone from my account to yours. If I had not had the funds in my bank to cover this unwarranted second charge. I would be severely over drawn, and subject to many many fees. This is extremely unprofessional and unacceptable. No hotel should do this, no hotel does this. But they did. Supposedly the charge will drop, but even if it does I am still very unhappy. You can ruin peoples credit by doing this to them. I will talk briefly about everything else. The hotel is older, but well maintained. Parking is plentiful by narrow. During the day behind the office building where the laundry is, the day staff leave a wooden gate open, which extends slightly past the fence. It is extremely tight and difficult to squeeze between it and any parked cars. Additionally there was no handicap parking convenient to the handicap room. The bed was alright, but clearly not the size advertised, as I stated prior. The housekeeper who usually did our rooms was extremely nice, she offered my partner extra coffee for the room, and even asked if we wanted the beds made. As we prefer to use our own blankets. The hotel itself was nice, but there were just so many big errors. I will never stay at this hotel again.
1	A nice option just a tad bit outside Gaslamp. 3 night stay during MLB All-star weekend. Originally opted for the Westin Gaslamp property, but this was 3 blocks further west and rates were better so opted for this choice. Not disappointed. Ocean views from 19 floor room, comfortable Westin beds, and nice lobby bar. 15 minute walk to Petco Park and easily found street parking within 1 block of hotel each evening, which was surprising for the downtown location. Will stay again when in town. Pool and fitness center were a bit disappointing from Westin standards. Complimentary Wi-fi for SPG members, otherwise paid.hvlewfamily - I am pleased to read you found our location to be convenient to all the festivities for the All Star Baseball events. It is unfortunate to hear you didn't enjoy our outdoor pool, Jacuzzi and sun deck. This area is open from 6am to 10pm daily with views of downtown and the bay. Our WestinWORKOUT Fitness Studio is open 24 hours a day and recently we added several new pieces of equipment (bikes, leg machines and an ab machine). I am glad you enjoyed your overall experience and appreciate you taking the time to share your experience with Trip Advisor.Kind Regards, Alyssa TurowskiGeneral Manager
0	Drunken slum of a hostel. We have traveled extensively prior, and have stayed at many hostels of similar price range, this one however, is a whole new experience for us. At the check in, the staff opened not with the availabilities of their facilities, but with the offer of free alcohol, every single day. What they didn't say, was that the staff themselves drank most of the free booze, and were hungover most of their shifts. The were more interested in sharing their drunken antics rather than providing any help to the customers. There was only one girl Billy who spoke English (and she's the least useful one out of them all), the rest of the staff spoke very little English and had trouble understanding us.The free alcohol turned lots of the hostel guests into violent drunks, who threw knives at each other in the kitchen whilst cooking.Hostel was extremely noisy and was impossible to sleep without earplugs. The mattress was creaky and filthy, and we didn't even dare to cover ourselves with their blankets, on which we had presumed was dried blood.
0	Problems w/ Hot Water Recovery Delivery Abbey Inn. We gave a poor rather than terrible rating because Abbey Inn earns positive points for cleanliness which offsets the fact that there was no hot water for morning showers. We were very impressed with the manager of Abbey who called our room in response to...More
1	Got a heck of a deal on Hotwire--beautiful hotel. I grabbed this good deal on Hotwire for about 80 per night. Of course, being right in the city, we had to pay for valet parking through the hotel for 20 per night. But this still was cheaper than most hotels in the area. This hotel was by far the fanciest accommodations we stayed in on our trip to Washington State, and a great way to end our vacation.Since we left the car with the valets (and didnt want to pay for parking around the city), we simply walked everywhere around town. Pike Place Market is just four blocks from the hotel, and the waterfront is just a few blocks past that. We walked over to the Seattle Center (10 blocks), but have to admit that we rode the monorail back. It stops right in the mall that connects to the back of the hotel--very convenient!! We also walked to Pioneer Square (13 blocks) and even walked to the REI flagship store (13 blocks).We stayed on the 8th floor, looking towards 5th Street. Our room with a king-sized bed was super comfy and everything was extremely clean.
1	Stay and Play, You Will Enjoy It!. Spent four nights and enjoyed it a lot! I wouldn't mind going back, but I'd probably try somewhere else on my next visit to NYC, just to be fun. Some notes:- No digital clocks in the room... nice analog clocks for a change! - Workout facility in-house, reasonably good enough and clean. No pool onsite, but access is given to a nearby gym at reasonable rates apparently. - Small but beautiful elevators- Only hotel that I have been to that has Opus One and Johnny Blue bottles available for purchase in each room. - We had free wi-wi in room- We had Club access and that is our favorite way to go at the Ritz. Some pros and cons include: * Lots of food and coffee when needed * Some flies on cheese * Helpful and nice people / service * Great breakfast * Repeated menu EVERY single day... a bit boring. - Got free parking with one of my rooms, but not the other. Would have been 65/day (!) - Nice amount of pens, paper, soaps, and other useful items in room including currency power converter for international devices- Choice of AM newspapers- Extremely fair at checkout... anything we didn't agree with was immediately taken off our bill. Cons:- Horses hang out across the street and often lobby has horse-smell. - Cigarette smell in EACH of three hotel rooms that I was in during my stay. After about 5 minutes in the room you wont notice it any more. - Very few, if any, rooms with two beds in them... - The employee's two way radios do not work in every room, causing delays- In room safe is too small for laptop- Welcome water was offered by front desk, but could have been helpful in the room instead. - Requested to see if an upgrade was available at checkin -- maybe, but only for additional money. - Do not even think of getting a room not facing central park in this hotel. Not only does it not face central park, it faces NOTHING. We moved out of this smelly room immediately. - Draws are small in room- Only one luggage rack in our room- Relatively small rooms to other Ritz properties I've been to
0	A Little On The Funky Side. To be honest, at 52.78 (including tax) this was a good value for the money. The rooms are fairly clean (ish) and are a good size. However, there is an underlying 'funky' smell that is everywhere - from the lobby to the rooms. When I laid down for the night the smell was not sleep inspiring to say the least.... More
0	lack of customer service. I have been a Hilton Honors member since the inception of the program. Arrived at the hotel with family, and a man checked us in for a room, confirming the reservation (had conf. ). Then Veronica Bonilla, asst. GM, came to the desk and said my reservation was cancelled per my bank. When I questioned that, she became unpleasant. She stated the hotel had called me 3 times (no record of calls on my cell phone). I called my bank, it seems the hotel had imputed my expiration date incorrectly. I had confirmation for a suite but was given a different class of room with a slight decrease of cost (12.38). However, we waited for over an hour (with a toddler) for another room, even though my original room (suite) was still available.The next morning we went for breakfast about 9:50 am but part of the food was already taken away. Earlier than the 10 am noted time. We had to eat out at a restaurant. I have traveled to many Hilton's for business and pleasure and this by far had the worst customer service, especially follow-up by a manager (with attitude) and untruths that I had been called. I was also told that the GM would call me on Monday, again no call. If you are in the Seaworld vicinity, stay at another property. With our annual passes, I know I will next time. Additionally, when I was at the desk, another customer was also complaining about misinformation they had received by a clerk about the shuttle. When I checked out, the clerk gave me my receipt and then said, oh did I give you the wrong persons receipt. After I showed it to her, she said, no, that is yours!
0	Pay your money and take your chances. It's all about the budget! Sleep, shower and get out ! I don't have the heart to complain about all the amenities this place dose not have so I'll say instead that this property has had yet another refurbishing and a very good one. I appreciate that.
1	Trendy and Fun!. Bad: Appetizers at the bar could have been better. No view but we weren't looking for that. Hot tub would have been nice. Good: We got a great price though Booking.com at this awesome boutique hotel. Felt like we won the lottery. The decor in the lobby, bar and room was trendy. They have a game room with pool, shuffle board, ping pong, giant jenga, and a Wii. My boyfriend and I had it all to ourselves one night. We keep getting drinks from the bar and we had a blast. Didn't need to go out that night! We booked there because we wanted to be in walking distance of the Giants game at ATT park. Had a great time at the game even though Giants lost that one. We like the exercise room. They actually had more than just treadmills! We liked it because we like to lift weights and we were able to get a moderate workout. Book it!
1	Great Stay!. I really enjoyed my stay at The River Hotel! It had a great location. Our room overlooked the Chicago River and we were directly across from Trump Tower. Very cool. The hotel was also within walking distance to almost everything we wanted to do (Millenium Park, Shedd aquarium, the Field Museum, Magnificent Mile, food, etc.). One of my favorite features of the hotel was the free bottles of water. It was nice to grab a bottle and fill it up before heading out for the day. I will definitely be recommending this hotel to any friends traveling to Chicago!
1	Great Hotel!. We were blown away at the dcor and style of this Courtyard Marriott! We were finishing our vacation week which was split between Myrtle and Charleston SC and we had just been very disappointed by our stay in Charleston at the Hyatt Place. This was just what we needed to turn things around! We were going to a show at the House of Blues and it was perfect, just down the street! Plenty of gas, mini golf, food, bars, shopping etc nearby! We arrived early and they did not have rooms ready so they gave us free waters and snacks and although we maybe waited 30 mins for a room they kept checking on us as well as still got us into a room before the posted check in time on 4th of July weekend! I would highly recommend this hotel!!

They treated us as if we brought the bugs with us!!!!!!.Yes,they changed our room but rented the room to someone else .We will never stay at this hotel again and will share this story to everyone The manager never contacted us !!!!!!!
1	Perfect location, great hotel!. The OPI is not a luxury hotel, but it is one of my all-time favorites. We have stayed twice in the past two years, and can't say enough good things about it. The location is absolutely perfect- right on the beach and walking distance to almost anywhere in Pacific or Mission Beach. Both times we have booked partial ocean view rooms, which look out on the pool and actually seem to be full ocean views. The rooms themselves are clean and relatively modern, with fridges and small balconies (and amazing views). The free breakfast is not exactly gourmet, but is generous and includes fruit, yogurt, cereal, and a waffle bar. We found the staff to be quite friendly and helpful. The hairdryer in our room stopped working as I was getting ready for a wedding- I panicked, but the maintenance man came within 10 minutes to replace it, which I very much appreciated. Overall, I can't recommend this place enough if you are looking for a reasonably priced and centrally located beach hotel. I've stayed in a few other hotels in the area, but none come close to the OPI.Fantastic review Olivia! We are thrilled to hear you once again enjoyed your stay with us, and were honored to be your go-to property for your visits to PB. Make sure youre friends with us on Facebook to read about local events, see some beautiful pictures, and maybe even use a special for your next trip out! See you then!
0	they tried. There was 3 good points for this place the shuttle stop was in front of the hotel. it is so close to Disneyland we were able to watch the fireworks from the room, and the night clerk was very helpful. Unfortunately, nothing else was positive. The beds were horrid and after a log day at Disneyland a good (not a great) bed is a must. Bad bathrooms, no exhaust fan ,toilet made scary noise after flushed. Maid staff poor, 1 of the 2 days of our stay, our room was not serviced. the outside of the hotel was dirty, and had exposed wiring( safety issues). The continental breakfast is a joke. a bag of bread, a toaster, doughnuts from the box store, and a jug of old orange juice is not going to get anyone through the morning. Less than basic cable.....no ESPN. would we stay there again..................NO
1	Relaxing, Clean and Friendly Staff. When we arrived, the exterior of the hotel was very colorful and set the tone for a relaxing stay. Christian and Lyle at the front desk were very welcoming. They offfered suggestions on where to eat and handed out some free appetizer coupons to local restaurants. This location has a Starbucks's that served breakfast. Breakfast was not free unless you have a voucher from the front desk. Christian was very nice and gave us vouchers for one morning of our stay. The pool is heated and felt great. The hot tub was also a welcome relief to sore muscles from all the walking we did on Old Town. One of the great features of this hotel is that it is walking distance to Old Town and restaurants. It is also centrally located to the freeway and MCRD and not far from the airport. It does have a shuttle on Thursday and Friday to MCRD. and LIMITED airport shuttle service. The only drawbacks were you had to pay for nightly parking and the computers were very slow and the printer was not working. The rooms were clean and updated.
1	Such a cool place!!!. My Adult son and I stayed at the vagabond for 2 nights. I am a huge fan of MCM decor and architecture. This place transported me back to my childhood and family vacas at Florida motels. It is very updated with all of the modern conveniences. Great rooms comfortable and well appointed. There was a pool party on Saturday form 1-7:30pm where music was played quit loud all day. However we were gone most of the day and this didn't bother us too much. Also, we were informed via email prior to our arrival about it. All in all a wonderful place. Continental breakfast is free to guest. The hotel restaurant is great! A little pricey but there are many places near by to eat.The hotel is located in the historic Mid Century Modern district and it was fully renovated less than 4 years ago - we stayed true to the architecture and design of the 1950s era.We do have pool parties only during the summer season (3 a month) for our hotel guests and local residents to enjoy. We try to manage the noise level as best as we can and adhere to noise ordinances. We hope you return for a visit soon!
1	Pleasant stay. Stayed for 4 nights on a first trip to San Francisco. A pleasant hotel and an enjoyable stay.A clean, good sized twin room. Bathroom had no lock on its ill fitting sliding door and shower was a bit puny compared to most American hotels. However the room was very acceptable. As a British tourist I would have loved a kettle in the room, but when in Rome etc.Service was generally excellent from the staff with one exception, which was that housekeeping twice let herself into the room during late afternoon (even though the room had long since been cleaned) then turned around with no explanation when she saw we were there. We used the do not disturb sign during the rest of the stay but what she was doing still remains a mystery.WiFi was excellent.We never did locate the stairs which was a shame given we had to use the lift to travel just one floor.Breakfast was good, but pricey for what it was.The hotel is very well situated, pretty much in the middle of the city.Richard, it's an honor to have been part of your American experience. Excellent service is our priority, and I will talk to the staff about any miscommunication there might have been with our housekeeping team during your visit. I hope to see you back in the states soon! Warm wishes,Pablo B. General Manager
0	Not the best. We had to stay at the Econo Lodge because everywhere else was fully booked. The room itself wasn't that bad. But the price is definitely too high for what you get. Staff not particularly friendly. Overall non the best place we've stayed. I can't say...More
1	Would stay here again. Booked the room for business travel with two others and it suited us well. Good location, easy access to the airport, plenty of restaurants close by and easy access to the metro area without being in the middle of the tourist areas. Rooms are huge and the bed was really comfortable. Nice lounge/restaurant area and the lobby has been upgraded. Easy to park. The fitness room could use a little help but over all it was a nice stay.My team and I have thoroughly enjoyed reading your fantastic review and I would like to thank you for taking the time to list our amenities so accurately. Since you have noted the fitness center as the one area we could improve on, I am delighted to tell you that we have scheduled a full fitness center renovation during the month of September, including new equipment. We are very excited to announce this upgrade to our guest experience and hope that we will exceed your expectations during your next visit!
0	Nasty. The worst experience in my life please never go close to tis hotel ughhhhh nasty rooms smells bad
1	Good Location, great staff and free wine during happy hour!. This hotel is a block away from the Gaslamp district where you can get great food and good shopping. When I arrive, the room wasn't ready yet but they offer to store my luggage and told me they'll give me a call when my room was ready. You also can't go wrong with the free wine during happy hour!Thanks a great review! Now we have to get you back in hopes to achieve 5 stars :)I'm glad you had a good time in San Diego.... and thanks for staying with us at Solamar.

0	THE WORST HOTEL! - EVERRRRRRRRR!. Hi Guys - I am not going to say I am a connoisseur of a traveler, but when I see something not worthy of the Benjamin's I am putting out, I am going to say something.My friends 50th birthday and I got commissioned in booking the hotel for 15 grown men in AC. The pictures from the Chelsea hotel website are not bad (DONT GET FOOLED!) and hence I booked it for 15 of my friends. On arrival we were told we are not in the main tower but the side building the Annex (Annex - the hotel website does not have pictures from the Annex, how could they!). The walk from the lobby to the Annex was pretty shady, the elevator looked like the freight elevator, the hallway from the elevator to the room had used furniture and appliances lying on the floor, on arriving in the room the decor was piecemeal together (nothing matched), the room had stains all over the carpet, on taking the shower (I was hammered by the time I got in the shower - still wondering why did I go to the shower) there was slim in the bath tub. This wonderful (pun intended) experience cost as 199 a night. I think they should have paid me, considering the hazing I got and have been getting from my 14 friends ever since.If you want to experience Hotel Transylvania please book at the Chelsea.
1	Beautiful and Restful...Just what we needed. I have traveled for business a lot, and I've come to expect little from convention hotels. So I was delightfully surprised by the Renaissance Waverly Hotel. The interior designers did a great job appointing this facility. It was beautiful and well set up for a good night's rest. My only complaint (and this is negligible) is the background music. The ambient sounds being pumped into the atmosphere was an odd mix of drumbeats and birdsong and repetitive music -- it was like the hotel couldn't decide what atmosphere to shoot for.But all in all, the staff was courteous, the rooms were clean and comfortable, and the experience was overwhelmingly positive.Thank you for the feedback, I am really pleased that you had a restful stay with us. I will review the music play list and ensure it is correct, thank you for bringing this to my attention!
1	Crammed space, good location. Because of the limited space in your room items will constantly be competing for it. We had a courtyard room and barely had enough space for our luggage (forget about using it for 4 people). The obvious place for bags is either in front of the door (blocking it) or in between the beds. There's hardly room for your toiletries and you have to remove them if you want to make coffee. Also, the a/c is half a foot from a bed, so you have a constant cold flow over your bed.That said, the location is really good: you're just blocks away from all the fun in Bourbon Street there's a streetcar in front of the building and you are only steps away from the Armstrong park. Breakfast was rather good as well with plenty of eggs and bacon.I am sorry to hear about your experience. I hope the next time you are in New Orleans you will come back and see us. Please call me directly when you are ready to book so I can show our appreciation. 504-522-8531 Sincerely, Chastity
0	Will NOT stay again.. Room needed some work, or a deep cleaning. It smelled like someone tried to cover a moldy smell with air freshener that smelled like cologne. Though the bed was comfortable, the sheets were dirty on one of the beds, as if someone had walked across it with shoes on. The room had a mini fridge but it was turned down to 1 so I had to turn it on to store my food items. I was given room 115, which unfortunately for me was right near the breakfast area so as soon as breakfast was available I was woken up by everyone walking by and holding loud conversations. Then at 7:45am, what I can only assume was a dance troop staying there, started practicing their routines in the middle of the parking lot while blasting their music and yelling. At 9am when I went to check out they were still going strong and oblivious to anyone trying to navigate the lot. When I was trying to back up, one of them walked up behind my vehicle and I had to ask them to move. Then after pulling out of my spot and attempting to leave, a few of them almost walked right in front of me because they were not paying attention. I find it extremely RUDE that they assumed everyone would be wide awake and want to listen to this. I also find it RUDE that the hotel manager did not go out there and ask them to stop because it may be disturbing other guests. On behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you gave us to implement improvements to ensure we offer a better experience for guests in the future.
1	A Great New Place to Stay in Napa. This place is ideally located with theaters, supermarkets, fast food, fine restaurants, all near by. The architecture is really beautiful and it is brand new. It provides easy access to downtown Napa as well as to the main highway north to all the wineries. My room was on the ground floor, No. 130 and there was some noise from upstairs translated below but not bad. Also had really nice, big screen, TVs.Dear TSCClovisCa,Thank you so much for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. I appreciate your awesome feedback, compliments of our hotel's location and arthitectural features. Thank you again for staying with the Hampton Inn SUites Napa, we hope to serve you again in the near future.
0	terrible stay. Terrible stay. Hallway air did not work the 3days I stayed. Complained to staff several times and they did nothing about it. Phones in my room did not work my last night and there was a couple staying next door that was up late arguing...tv up loud and I was not able to contact the front desk due to the... More
0	Worst hotel experience EVER!. Not sure how in the world this is a Hilton hotel or even why Disney allows them to be an official representing hotel. To make it worse there were other customers complaining. It had nothing to do with the pool remodeling. Mold smell and unkept rooms. We got moved to 3 rooms and finally decided to check out!
0	Disappointing. If you decide to book this hotel you will be disappointed.
1	Very comfortable hotel.... Traveled to Atlanta for family reunion. I've stayed at a Renaissance before, but not in the Atlanta area. I'm a Marriott Rewards member, so I try to stay within the Marriott family. I found hotel on Expedia.com and the reviews were decent.When we arrived, it was around 9 pm. The concierge was not present outside, so we proceeded to checkin at the front desk. The front desk clerk was ok, but did not have the bubbly personality that I am familiar with during a late checkin. Each time I went to front desk for information, the same personality was observed on different clerks. We were placed in room 624. The room was very clean and nicely decorated. The beds were extremely comfortable and the room was very spacious. The hotel is VERY large and has a center indoor courtyard. There are about 3-4 elevators for entire hotel. They were not slow, but often crowded.We stayed 3 nights and each night the parking was very difficult. There was a beauty pageant taking place during the same weekend, so parking was horrible. We found a spot each night, but it often took 3 times going around the parking lot before we found one that was a 2 minute walk from the hotel. I felt safe each time walking from the parking lot to the hotel. The pool area was very crowded, even an hour before it closed. They have two pools, one indoor and one outdoor. The indoor pool is a salt water pool. Overall, I would definitely stay here again and hopefully not during a beauty pageant event.Thank you for the detailed feedback on your recent visit. You were here during a very busy convention and am sorry our space was so active. I hope we have the chance to have you back soon and enjoy our amenities in the future!
0	Pick another place. Unfortunately the furnature and decor is from the late 1960s or early 1970s and it also appears it hasn't been kept up since then. They allow pets but unless everything else is booked, as it was for me, I will not return to this place.
0	Musty as an old barge!. I booked site unseen as I am a Best Western Rewards member. This hotel is older than the seven seas! The outside is old and needs maintenance, appearing more like a highway side trucker motel than a hotel. Rooms are old and musty, with water and moisture damage radiating from the bottom of the exterior door and bathroom door. I know it's moist in San Diego, but doesn't necessarily mean the room should smell moldy. Room appeared clean at first glance, but tile floor in shower/toilet area needed scrubbing and vanity looked like it was never dusted. Shower water was luke warm.Thank you for your comments regarding your recent stay at our property. We would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. The Best Western Seven Seas is an older property however, we are continually upgrading our guestrooms, exterior, and other amenities to meet the needs of our guests. Rest assured your concerns are being shared with the appropriate departments in order to be discussed. We hope that you will consider staying with us again, so that we can have another chance to provide you with a superior experience. Thank you! -Team BW7S
1	Good time in NOLA. Check your bill before you leave!. The lobby was small, but modern. The valet and check in staff were great. We had a package that included breakfast. We ordered and put both orders on one slip (Why waste paper), but the hotel charged us for one breakfast because they were not written on TWO separate tickets. The food was not so great. Pre-cooked and microwaved. Not worth the money. The room was great, but we had a corner room. The waterpressure could have been better. Overall, not too bad. Not my first choice for a NOLA hotel, but would consider it again if I had to.Glad you had a great time overall here with us at Aloft NOLA. We appreciate your feedback and are always looking for ways to improve. Like most Aloft's, our breakfast options are grab and go items aimed at quick and convenient service. On a brighter note, those corner rooms are great and offer fantastic views on the Crescent City. We appreciate your business and look forward to having you back here with us again soon.Dixie Krauss, Operations Manager
1	1st trip to Seattle. This was my fist trip to Seattle, and this hotel was in a great location. Pikes Market is about 1.5 miles away. Everything is in walking distance, or there is a shuttle that will take you up to a mile out. It was a great experience.Dear AlexanderpX371AN, Thank you for completing a Tripadvisor Review regarding your recent stay at our hotel. I am glad that the location was a great for you! Please know that your feedback is extremely valuable to us and we will utilize your response to make every guest experience the best it can be. I greatly appreciate your kind words and they will be celebrated with the entire team. We hope you make a 2nd trip to Seattle soon! If I can be of any assistance to you, please contact me directly. We look forward to being of service to you in the near future. Best regards, Jonathan
0	sketchy. Homeless people wandering the parking lot and lobby. Dirty carpets and smelly rooms with ripped bedding. Not impressed. Employees were nice enough and apologized for the homeless people who followed you in your car in the parking lot asking for money.
1	Mandatory stay while in New Orleans. Mandatory stay while in Nola...the hotel is Centrally located to restaurants, French quarter, garden district or warehouse district! They have bikes to be used to tour the city. The service was impeccable and there 24 hours. The bar area very nice-I travel here every two months...you must make the Aloft your hotel of choice when in Nola.Easy access to everything NOLA has to offer is key to a great stay and having the bike rental on site makes it that much easier. We are glad you got to take advantage of our central local and hope to see you in two months!
1	Frisco bucket list!. Smallest room but that's SF! We got an interior room away from the street so it was quiet. Little odd that the sink is outside of bathroom but you get used to it! Wall unit AC was adequate for ventilation to keep air moving. SF Weather was perfect during our stay at 58-75 degrees. Odd thing one day was no hot water at 1 pm when I went to take a shower, just a one off I guess. Elevator seems a bit dodgy at times but still functional, just have to use the close door button frequently!There's a Starbucks next door for coffee and Colibri Mexican restaurant the other direction. (Colibri must be a good place because we couldn't get a seat to the bar for happy hour for two days, so we gave up!)I would stay again but there are other nicer looking options a couple of blocks away at Union Square. Thank you for the kind comments on your recent stay with us. We are happy to hear you had a nice visit to our hotel. I will ask my maintenance team to look into why there was no hot water at 1pm during your stay. We are very sorry for the inconvenience. We appreciate your feedback and hope to impress you on a future visit.
1	Excellent 1st experience at a Kimpton. My husband and I really loved our experience at the Kimpton. We were delighted about the complimentary happy hour and loved the lounge atmosphere. The room and bathroom though a little small had a very nice large tv and super comfy beds. I didn't particularly like the bathroom French doors which were a bit awkward. The closet even holds a nice yoga mat but I can see difficulty in doing yoga in such a small room!The fitness facility was excellent but unfortunately we didn't have any time to use it!Thanks for the review! We're delighted to see you enjoyed your first time with us and we look forward to making you loyal Kimptonites! :)Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager
1	Business Trip to multiple locations in San Diego, CA. I just spent a week long business trip in the San Diego area. Staying at the Hampton Inn was a pleasure. It's located a bit north of the city with easy access to the highway network without traffic noise disturbing your sleep or concentration while working in the evenings. The hotel serves an excellent breakfast and there are a couple good restaurants in walking distance for the evening meal and many others a short drive away. While this is not close to the downtown attractions that would bring me here on vacation, (i.e., Old Town, Gas Lamp District and the Waterfront) it is the ideal location for business travelers or meetings as long as you have transportation. I had a meeting on the south side of town this morning, approx 26 miles away. It took about 30-45 minutes to get there, which is not a problem if you plan properly. I have another in the morning and I'm not concerned about making it on time.I will be attending a conference in San Diego during February and I will definitely be staying here again.
1	Beautiful hotel...nice rooms..great location. The hotel lobby is beautiful and we enjoyed a few nights using it. The rooms were spacious and nice dcor. There are a few restaurants/bars onsite with limited options for food. This is in a business district, and therefore the reason for the inflated prices in their onsite restaurant. It was nice to have free daily parking, and a great location to many things in the area. I truly enjoyed the roof-top pool and how spacious it was. Although I did have some issues at check-in with the Hotel manager and desk clerk, who was not aware of their own Marriott FAM certificate process and almost denied my room, luckily I was prepared for this and their lack of knowledge- I did not hold that against them, as I assume my situation is not common. Overall, it was very clean, friendly and a great hotel. We travel to Atlanta several times a year, this will be on my list of hotels I will stay again.Thank you so much for the feedback, we hope to see you back soon!
1	Good value, great service, need some tweaks. Carpets/rooms are too perfumed/scented for me. Not good for some with sensitivities to scents such as myself and for use of my CPAP machine for sleep apnea since the scent gets absorbed into my machne filters. Please consider getting a fragrence free deoderizer for carpets/rooms or at least a very lightly scented one. The overpowering scents also made me nauseated from time to time. Breakfast had a fairly good assortment, but could use a change in the egg product. The eggs taste too much like a reconstituted procseed egg product for me. The fresh toast sticks available at times were a great addition to breakfast. The front desk staff were exceptional and provided awesome friendly service. Shuttle personel also great and friendly. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone staying that has a family member at Medical City Hospital.Dear 721jeffreygu,Thank you for your kind words regarding your stay at the Hawthorn Suites Dallas Park Central. We were glad to have you as our guest, and appreciate you taking the time to comment regarding your visit with us. I have shared your recommendation regarding air freshener with our staff. Given the number of guests we have from Medical City, I completely agree is it worth looking into. We look forward to the opportunity to host you again the next time you are in the Dallas area. Thanks again for being our guest! Best regards, Charlie Westhoven Operations Manager Hawthorn Suites Dallas Park Central
0	Very uncomfortable experience. I stayed at this hotel in June 2016. The first room they tried to give me had been broken into by having the screen cut and the window pushed open. The caretaker was concerned but simply retrieved the key to the adjacent room and continued my check-in. When I arrived at my new room the first thing I did was... More
0	Not as Good as a 5-star should be.. The Good:-Clean rooms.-Room service twice daily.-Room size is adequate.-Valet parking gets your car fast and parks it fast as well.-Hotel looks clean and nice in general.The Bad:-There is no private beach as advertized, it is a small, man-made beach, with no access to water.-The pool is very small compared to the size of the hotel.-Valet parking is mandatory and costs 34 per day, other (and better) hotels charge only 30 per day.-The fan in the bathroom in our room did not work and was not fixed despite complainig.-The toilette flush in our bathroom takes FOREVER to refill and was not fixed despite complaining (I have used the so-called ECO flushed in many older and modern hotels, so I know how it is supposed to work, ours was not functionning normally, nor as intended.-The batrhoom sink did not drain, they fixed it after we complained.-The hotel rooms show unusual signs of aging, despite the hotel being only around 10yrs. old.-The staff is arrogant and border-line rude (except for the valet parking guys, who are great).-The food at the hotel is marginal, the fruits in our 60 breakfast for 2 were NOT fresh, and we could not eat them. - As staff was so arrogant and our previous complaints were ignored (regarding the bathroom issues) we did not even bother complaining about stale fruits posing as fresh ones...we were happy it was our last day.-In general I recommend Trump and Sofitel hotels over Mandarin Oriental.Dear Guest,Thank you for your recent review of Mandarin Oriental, Miami on Trip Advisor. We sincerely apologize that your visit did not meet your expectations. Our private beach is not promoted as one for swimming but for relaxing and enjoying the stunning views. The tranquility and surroundings of our pool and beach provide a quiet escape for our guests.I am sorry to learn of the plumbing related issues. I will address this with our Engineering team to ensure there are no further problems.Additionally, I regret to hear the lapse in service you indicated by our staff. We pride ourselves in ensuring all our colleagues deliver quality service and genuine hospitality to our guests and make sure their visit is seamless and enjoyable. Please understand we only purchase quality, fresh produce and turn away anything that is not up to our standards. As far as the pricing, we are competitively priced with other luxury hotels in the area.With regards to the valet parking, due to the limited space available for parking facilities in the area, we do need to charge a fee for overnight stays. Most Miami hotels experience the same situation and charge rates equivalent or higher.I do apologize again that your stay was not an enjoyable experience.SincerelyJorge GonzalezGeneral Manager
1	Great Stay. I stayed recently for 3 weeks because I was working nearby. The property was very nice, the surroundings we not great though for a long term stay. It is extremely close to the airport which made it convenient. The room was comfortable, I asked for a refridgerator and although it was not placed in the room when I arrived all 3 times, it was promptly brought up after I checked in. The breakfast area is small but it was nice to sit in during the day. There was not too much variety to the breakfast items but everything was good. I also used the fitness center which had new equipment and was clean.Overall the staff was pleasant and helpful and the property was clean and comfortable. Unfortunately for a long term stay the surroundings are a little blah, not much to do unless you have time to venture into the city of Philadelphia. There is a Ruby Tuesday next door for dinner but aside from that I found you had to venture pretty far to find places to eat that weren't in a sketchy neighborhood although I will admit I didn't do too much exploring since I was very busy at work while I was there.It was a nicely run Hampton and I would stay there again if I were to be working in the area.
0	Doesn't look like Vegas.. We decided to stay a few extra days in Vegas and found a good offer at the Suncoast, plus we wanted to spend our mornings hiking in Red Rock. The positives: economical, close to Red Rock, large pool, lots of parking, large rooms, nice staff. Negatives: old, the carpets are shaggy like the atmosfere in general. In the end we wound up just sleeping and spending the afternoons on the Strip, which takes 30 minutes by car.Thank you for your review. Sounds like you enjoyed most of your stay, and you will be pleased we are going through a full scale remodel of our hotel rooms. I think you will be pleased with our new rooms, and we look forward to your future stay. Have a nice day.
1	Loved it!. My husband and I stayed 4 nights in an upgraded King size room, with a living room, which was comfortable and perfect! We had a great rate, and the hotel is in the perfect location for the theatre, shopping, cable car, and hopping on the train to get just about anywhere. I can't say enough about the front desk staff, who were so helpful and friendly. They provided great tourist tips, and even went out of their way to find us tickets to a sold out concert. Hotel Albri was absolutely perfect, and if we are back in SF, we will definitely stay there again.
0	You get what you pay for. It served the purpose of being close to the airport. Other than that, not much good to say. Very dated, loud heater that made it hard to sleep, awful towels. Had the creeps all night. Housekeeping did as good as they could with old used-up rooms.
0	Great location. Poor customer service.. Not pleased. Poor experience. Will definitely stay somewhere else next time. 7 day/6 night stay...zero cleaning despite numerous requests, no fresh towels or linens entire week other than towels/soap/toilet paper we helped ourselves to from nearby cart. overflowing garbage cans were finally put in hallway day 4.Dear RobinsU9085vk,Thank you very much for taking the time our of your day to review our hotel and share your stay with us. I very much appreciate the feedback and I am very sorry to hear about the poor costumer service you experienced. I assure you that your feedback is taken seriously and we will use it to better our hotels operations. I am happy to hear that you enjoyed our great location. Please keep us in mind the next time you are in the Seattle area. We would love to be given another opportunity to ensure you have a great stay. Please feel free to reach out to me personally. We do appreciate your business. Sincerely,Jonathan
0	Pass this one up. We were traveling to the east coast and needed a one night stay so we called ahead and booked with Baymont because he informed us of the Brand new remodeled room. We got to the room and found new carpet and it ended there. The tv was an antique with a remote that would not operate this old set, the... More
0	Eh... Barely Average. I suppose you get what you pay for. Rooms appear clean but are small. Pricing is still a bit high for what you get. Rooms are a bit noisy and you can hear others' in hallways and in adjacent rooms. The only perk is the free breakfast, which is just okay.The thing that really bothered me about this property was the shuttle service. So, they advertise they have shuttle service, but if you don't tell the front desk at least a half day ahead of time they tell you that they ain't got you down on the shuttle log and they act like they are doing you a favor to get a ride back to the airport on the top of the hour. Hello! Take a customer service class or don't advertise free shuttle service!Thank you makling the Fairfield Inn/ Marriott, we are unpleased that your stay with us was not enjoyable. However, thank you for bringing your concerns to our attention. We strive to ensure that our service is pleasing to our guest. We sincerely apologize for this inconvenience. Should you require any further assistance please feel free to contact the hotel.Thank you Faith JonesAssistant General Manager
1	Clean Room and Excellent Service. I enjoyed a 2 night stay here recently and will surely make this my choice to stay in the Atlanta area in the future. First and foremost, our room was clean and comfortable. The location, being attached to the mall next door, is very convenient. However, the the highlight of my stay was the service of the front desk, concierge and valet/shuttle team. Im sure this was a very busy weekend but all of these individuals were the most proactive service oriented hospitality professionals. They truly seem to want to do everything they can to make your stay top notch. Other members of our party were staying at a different hotel down the road and wished they had stayed here.PS. Loved the refreshing fruit infused water in the lobby and the make your own trail mix happy hour. Very fun and appreciated! Dear 007traveler64,Thank you for sharing your fantastic experience at JW Marriott Atlanta Buckhead! It was a pleasure to read your review, especially that our hospitality surpassed your expectations. Our goal is to provide the highest levels of service so you will visit often and recommend us to others. Thanks again for choosing us, and we are looking forward to welcoming you back for another memorable trip. Best Regards,Eb MbyeDirector of Operations
0	Older hotel, Smelly room, Slow internet, Old TVs, out of breakfast.... Our group stayed over a weekend for a trade show.Overall it was just an OK stay. Pool was closed. Gym was ok.The room smelled fine but when we returned in the evening it began to smell kinda moldy. Our TV was vintage 1990's and matched the rest of the room.In the morning we went for breakfast and they ran out of food for a good 15 minutes. Everyone ate cereal and got out out. It's a hotel. They have a breakfast rush every morning. I would expect there to be someone monitoring the food.On the other hand the Coffee was great! They also have a pancake machine! For triple digits I'm disappointed with the stay. Will stay elsewhere next time.Dear lllClifflll,Thank you for choosing the Holiday Inn Express Buckhead and for sharing your experience with us. Sorry to hear you did not have a completely satisfied stay. We do apologize for any inconvenience caused at the breakfast. This is certainly not a norm for our hotel and we would definitely look into that. Again, we thank you for your feedback and hope you'll give us another chance to welcome you back and see how we have improved. Sincerely,Lin S.IHGCare
1	LOVED staying here. From the moment we walked in we were treated like royalty! Every.Single.Time we came back from whatever we were doing,we were greater with hello and how are you!!! Beds were comfy,pillows were too. Rooms were spacious. If I had one complaint it would be that the air conditioning blew right on to the queen bed closest to it. My husband fixed that by sitting a chair directly in front of it.We did not eat breakfast there but I'd recommend another hour onto that 9:00 cutoff ) Hotel is close to EVERYTHING.We stayed here and drove the 25 miles to mammoth cave and it was well worth it. You sure can't beat the 77 dollars a night for the service and cleanness of this hotel. Thanks so much Bay Mont of Bowling Green for making the last half of our mini Vaca awesome!
1	Awesome Place for its Price in Summer. This Residence Inn is kind of out of no where - it's pretty far from the center of city and has lots developments in the area. That being said, there are good restaurants/coffeeshops around within 3-5 mins drive. Their price for the room in summer is GREAT! Not sure if I would pay for what they ask for in spring though.Dear Jui-Yu C,Thank you for choosing the Residence Inn Phoenix North/Happy Valley for your recent travels to Phoenix. Commitment to service and guest satisfaction is a main focus and we are delighted to hear you enjoyed your stay. The pride and dedication our hotel team takes in providing exceptional customer service to our valued guests speaks strongly to our companys core values, good service at a fair price.Thank you again for taking the time to provide your feedback and we look forward to serving you again soon!
0	Windows, will your room have them. Booked room on Concur, checked into room late, to my surprise the room had no (0) (zero) windows. An actual interior room. Not happy to learn this. Didn't see this in the booking. Not a happy camper...Sorry to hear of your disappointment with your room. We do realize those windowless rooms aren't for everyone. They are labeled when booking as Loft King Room but i'm not sure how your booking channel has that set up. If you would like, I'd be happy to take a look into that for you. We hope we have another opportunity to earn your business back please reach out to me directly at Dixie.Kraussaloftneworleansdowntown.com or 504-312-7715.I hope to hear from you soon,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations
1	Great value and clean hotel. I just came to Orlando for a quick two night stay to see some friends for the weekend. The price at this hotel was excellent for a weekend stay. It is located near many other hotels and office buildings. The hotel itself is excellent, clean and the front desk staff were very friendly. I had absolutely no issues during the stay at all. The are a ton of restaurants in the area and a Hooters out the back door of the hotel. The serve a breakfast buffet in the morning, but since I'm not a big breakfast eater I passed on that. Overall your standard Hilton Garden Inn and I would definitely come back if I'm in the area again.Thank you for the feedback regarding your recent stay while visiting friends. We are delighted to read that your visit to the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport was pleasant, and that you liked our clean property, the front desk service and the excellent value we offer. It is pleasing to hear that you will be visiting us again, so that we can provide you with an outstanding service once more. Hope you had a wonderful time with your friends!All the Best,Debra Thompson-FrenchGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport
0	Not a great stay. When I checked in for my stay, the clerk could not even be bothered to get up out of her chair to do my paperwork. My room did not even have a shower curtain on my first night. The Super 8 was better.
1	located close to town center. The hotel is very out-dated - it had the felling of going to Catskill, NY for family vacation in the 50s. I was told that it was family owned for sixty years and I am sure that not many changes have been made during that time. It's hard to say what needs to be done - it was fine for us people who still remember 60s but our children were a little bit disappointed that kitchen and other amenities were not updated. Rooms were clean, cleaning service was friendly and responsive however everything looked rugged, old and lacked any charm. Too bad because the place is located in beautiful part of Carmel Valley. On the other hand if it exists for 60 years people must find it attractive and I wish the owner(s) good luck with this place for the next 60 years.
0	Hellbilly travels. Only had to change rooms once( no a/c) Here is a few other issues no tv ,wifi broken bathroom door, dripping water, toilet running. Employees were nice They told me I would get a good discount if I stayed. Still waiting!
1	Very Clean and Comfortable. It was a long haul from Adelaide to Seattle........but arriving at Hyatt House Seattle Downtown was very inviting and impressive!How perfect being located across from the Needle! Not having to go far for one of the Awesome Sightseeing sights!Beds very comfortable!Dear Cynthia B,Thank you for completing a TripAdvisor review regarding your recent stay at our hotel. Please know that your feedback is extremely valuable to us and we will utilize your response to make every guest experience the best it can be. I am glad to hear that you found our location across the street from the Space Needle to be perfect and beds comfortable! We greatly appreciate your 5 star review it will be celebrated with the hotel. If I can be of any assistance to you, please contact me directly. We very much appreciate your business and hope to see you gain soon! Most Sincerely,Jon
0	Avoid this place like the plague. It is not a good hotel.. Stayed here one night while in town for business. Only saving grace is it was only for one night. Hotel is in the midst of construction and they appear to be updating the lobby. Unfortunately they have not updated the rooms or the beds since 1954. The bed was unbelievable for a hotel. A huge crater in the middle of... More
1	Sleek and modern. This place was recently renovated and our room on the 23th floor felt like we were staying in a hi-end condo with breathtaking views of San Diego bay and the Coronado bridge. Sleek and modern decor with marble countertops stood out to me. There were two flat screen TV's, and a fully-stocked mini kitchen with fridge. Located right in the middle of downtown minutes away from the gas lamp district this place is prime location. The luxurious amenities combined with meticulous customer service especially in the downstairs restaurant makes for a memorable experience that I wouldn't hesitate to highly reccommend over and over again! Great job Marriott!Charles, thank you for a perfect review. We are so happy to hear you enjoyed your stay with us here in San Diego. We hope you will visit us again sometime.
0	Roach Motel. This was one of the worst hotels we have ever stayed at, we travel a lot and have stayed at a lot of hotels. I have reviewed a lot of hotels and I rarely leave a bad review, but this was too disgusting to not address.We were moving my cousin to Orlando, and needed a late night hotel last minute. We picked the best western, in hind sight I wish we had slept in the car. We checked in around 1 am. Once we got settled in and ready for bed, we started seeing small roaches crawling out from behind the painting above our bed. My husband killed the 2 that we saw. We were a little grossed out but that late at night, we didn't have many options. The next morning we woke up to more roaches crawling around the painting. Then we saw a couple of huge ones above the TV. After seeing this we wondered how many more were in the room. We grabbed our stuff went to front desk and told them. She refunded us 50 . My husband emailed the manager STUART BLOOMBERG about this. He emailed us back and told us the exterminators came and said the room was perfectly clean and there wasn't a single roach. So either we saw the only 4 roaches in the room or someone is not being honest. My husband relayed to Stuart how grossed out we were and asked for the remainder of balance to be refunded. Stuart told us he can't do that the roaches must have entered the room when we opened the door to enter the room ourselves. At this point not only were we disgusted by the pest infested room but also insulted by the manager that he would accuse us of letting the roaches in. We are realistic, a bug here and there is normal, but a roach infested room is a sign of filth. We are so disappointed, what a waste of money, and such poor customer service. STAURT BLOOMBERG offered us 50 off on our next stay, as if we would EVER go back to that hotel. I have never left a hotel feeling this disgusted. A word of advice to the manager of this hotel, don't blame your customers for your hotels lack of hygiene. Unprofessional staff, filthy hotel, stay somewhere else.Dear Deepti DI really appreciate you taking the time to share your disappointment with your recent stay. I want to personally apologize again as did my staff did for the failure in our extermination program. My staff did reduce your stay to 50 off before you checked out.A pest free environment is basic for a good stay. I am sorry if that was not the case during your stay. You can be confident that we did follow-up on your concerns, so that others are not disappointed as you were.Again, thank you for making the effort to share your thoughts. We value you as a guest, and I do want you to know that your concerns are our concerns! Please stay with us again soon, so that we can demonstrate our commitment to your comfort.
0	Do not stay here. When we first arrived inside the room a strong smell of mildew hit me. I decided to ignore it thinking it could be worse, and it was. Grasshoppers and other bugs were EVERYWHERE. The best part was the chirping throughout the night, from inside the room. The bathroom was not cleaned thoroughly and I was glad to get out of... More
1	Fathers Day Weekend. Just an amazing place. You are treated like a king all the time. This place has ruined me for all other hotels. I am going again this weekend and cannot wait. Maria Christine Duhon and Liubov were amazing. They took care of everything and made sure my wife and I were happy. I highly recommend the St Regis.Dear da0987654321, Thank you for your recent review on TripAdvisor. We truly appreciate you taking the time to detail your experience, and we are so pleased that you had a wonderful visit at The St. Regis New York. We will share your comments with our team members, and we are grateful of your praises.We look forward to welcoming you back as our guest in the near future!Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager
1	New Favorite Hotel in New Orleans. This trip was just a one night stay for a concert with just my daughter and myself. We arrived around 4:30 in the afternoon. Check in was quick and the clerk was extremely friendly and helpful. I requested the highest floor and away from street traffic and both were granted. The hotel is really nice inside and was spotless. Our room was a double and it was extremely clean and roomy. The bathroom was really nice and the beds were comfortable. We had adequate towels for the two of us. Another plus for this hotel is the secured parking lot is adjacent to the building. I really don't think there was anything that I would say needed improvement there. Customer service was great throughout the stay. You have to use your roomkey to access the hotel after 10:00 PM. You also have to use the key to operate the elevators from the lobby and to open and close the gate so be sure to keep one of your room keys when you check out if you are driving or you will have to go back inside as I did to get a key to get your car out. The hotel is walking distance to Bourbon St and the Riverwalk area (In my opinion). It may be a little far if you have any mobility issues. It is only a 4 or 5 block walk to the Superdome or the New Orleans Arena. We will be staying here again in the future.
0	This hotel is a disaster. Do not stay here.. Hotel Diva tries to position itself as trendy and chic. In reality, it is way over-priced and of very poor quality: small, very noisy rooms cheap, broken furniture terrible TV reception erratic water temperature in the shower. Only positives were good check in and check out.I stayed in room 620, facing Geary Street, on 6th of 7 floors. The traffic noise was absolutely horrendous and deafening. Also, there was a door to an adjoining room that looked of normal thickness but must be hollow as I could hear every word that the people in the next room said or watched on TV. Also, whenever the HVAC unit came on I had to adjust the TV volume, probably more due to the smallness of the room than anything else. I knew I was in trouble when I saw that the hotel provides you with ear plugs along with your shampoo, etc. You will not be able to sleep without the ear plugs.The bathroom is slightly bigger than a closet, with no room or shelves to put your stuff. I took a shower at 5am and the water temperature constantly fluctuated between hot and cold.The furniture is uncomfortable and cheap- the chair for the desk was broken and is not suitable for working.The TV reception is awful - very grainy and only analog. No digital. You do get free wi-fi. Wow.Stay away from this place. I went there via the secret hotel option on Travelocity - the hotel calls itself 3 1/2 stars. It's far from that.Dear Patrick H,Thank you for sharing your comments with Trip Advisor. Please accept my sincere apology for the inconvenience you experienced during your recent stay with us. I always encourage my guests to communicate to myself and my staff any concerns they may have during their stay. This way, we are able to accommodate our guests the best way possible and that they will have a pleasant stay with us. I most certainly hope you will give Hotel Diva another chance and give us the opportunity to change your impression on us. Pleasse contact me directly for future reservations so we can very well accommodate you.Best regards,Virgil LopezHotel Diva
1	Best Staff Ever. We needed a room for one day after surgery and having to return to the hospital the next day so Aloft was closest! To our pleasant surprise the staff was above and beyond accommodating from Tevin in Valet department to Misia and Tatyanna front desk! Thank you so much! Linda, Hopefully the surgery was as successful as the as your visit to our hotel. We do have the BEST STAFF and are grateful for their efforts. Tatyanna, Misha and Tevin will be cheered and celebrated for your shout out. Thank you for recognizing their efforts. Heal fast, then come back and have some fun!Evan
1	Nice boutique hotel in great location. The Abri is a nice boutique hotel. The location of the hotel is excellent. A couple blocks from Market St. I stayed during the Salesforce conference and I was happy to be in a quieter property that was close to all the major venues. The only very minor negative is the rooms were slightly on the smaller side. Or at least the room I had was. But the room was nicely appointed and it was similar to a hotel room you would get in Europe. Room size for me was entirely acceptable and did not make my stay any less comfortable. I would absolutely stay there again as I prefer boutique hotels versus the large chains. It's a nicely run and comfortable property.
0	Aweful place, very dissapointed. Sheets were dirty, beds were uncomfortable, floor was filthy with big burn marks in carpet from previous guest. Had to ask for a bag for the ice bucket, no lid. Fell on the stairs
1	Great Place, terrible service. For the location and price this place is a diamond in the rough. It was clean, had all the amenites one would like. But do not expect any service from the staff. The hispancis who cleaned up were the most friendly, they did speak each morning. There was a buffet breakfast that was offered (for a price), we were not even told about it. My daughter found it while exploring the hotel. They run two shuttles to the metro station, neither one would detour out of their way to drop us off at Arlington National Cememtary for a funeral. As I said before the property is well keep, clean, nice and for the location and price a deal. But do not expect southern hosptality or anyone to go out of their way to do anything special for you.
0	Terrible Motel. My husband and I were guest at this motel recently. We booked 3 nights to stay while on a family trip to the lake. After staying our first night, we had gone out of the room for several hours the following day. Upon our return to the room late in the evening, we noticed that our handgun that we had... More
1	Nice hotel. Location is perfect, you can walk to the millennium park, stores, restaurants, theaters, subway. Room was beautiful and they have great staff. We Checked out to go for a walk and they kept our luggage at the lobby because our flight was late at night.Hello Whenwetravelto,Thank you for choosing to stay at Chicago River Hotel during your recent trip. We are glad to hear you found the location to be perfect for your trip. We are lucky to be located right in the middle of everything! We are also delighted to hear you found the staff to be great as we pride ourselves on our service. We look forward to serving you again in the future.
1	Perfect location, helpful staff, nice room. This location is perfect: it's walking distance to the French Quarter and to the Business District, yet it's far enough away from the craziness of Bourbon Street that you can get some sleep, if that's your thing. Everyone is very friendly. Rooms are modern and comfortable. Nice shower. The bed was a tiny bit too soft for my liking, but it didn't tarnish my experience in the least.Thank you for taking the time to review your stay with us as we appreciate hearing how much you enjoyed our property and service provided. Sounds like our rooms and staff exceeded expectations which is our ultimate goal and know that our team will be commended for their efforts. It was a pleasure to have you as our guest and we look forward to having you stay with us again.Best regards,
0	Old. Room was cold, plugs did work had to move coffee pot to plug in. Staff was not helpful with a couple of exceptions. Internet did not work except off and on. Construction was noisy.The worst was had cold the room was, it is winter and could outside. They had a Thanksgiving special for Sun. night medical they would not extend the rate for the rest of my stay.Hi Traveler. Thank you for your review and we appreciate all of your feedback and will work to improve our service. Good luck in your future travels.
1	Love Estancia!!!. My husband and I were here last weekend for our anniversary. It was our first time staying here. What a gorgeous hotel! The grounds are immaculate and the rooms are lovely. The staff were all friendly and very welcoming from the moment we arrived. Everyone we encountered from valet, check-in, to the lady who delivered our room service breakfast were all very pleasant and nice. I must mention and give thanks to Alex from security. My husband realized on our way home that he left his ipad in the room. We called and were connected to Alex and he got our phone number and said he would check the room himself and get back to us. We promptly received a call back that he found it and arranged to have it next day aired back to us. We were so happy when it arrived! We really appreciate the professionalism shown by Alex and your hotel. We will be back and will highly recommend this hotel to friends and family! Love Estancia!Thank you for taking the time to write a review and for recognizing Alex as an outstanding employee- we couldnt agree more! Im so glad that you got your iPad back safe and sound. Thank you for recommending our hotel to your friends and family. We look forwarding to welcoming them to property.
0	Customer service.. I called there asking to speak to my husband in the room in which he was staying. I gave the first and last name. I had failed to ask my husband for the room number...however due to the fact that I was not staying there and never been asked that before by any other hotel I was a little confused.... More
0	THE WORST PLACE EVER!!!!. This thing doesnt have to be called a hotel, this is the worst place ever!!!!!!!!Hygiene is something the hotel doesnt know exsists, you can see food, cigarettes, used condoms and much more just a feet outside your door.Nasty parties during night!! We even had to call the police one night!!!!Just dont go to that place ever!
0	Continuation of my previous review. I stayed here back in February. Didn't have the greatest stay. My comments can be found in a previous review. After all was said and done the first time, the GM sent me 2 free night vouchers to use at any Residence Inn in the country. That was all well and good and I thought I was done with my bad stay. But those vouchers came back to haunt me as I went to use them in St Louis and I was told that marriott had stopped using those 2 years ago and they were no good. How embarrassing! The people in St Louis were great. Very helpful with the situation. I'd recommend never staying here again. In the end they ending up paying for my night in St Louis and giving me some points. Doesn't make up for the embarrassing situation. I even called marriott corporate in regards to the situation. Thank you so much for taking time to help us to understand what happened to you. Please accept our apology as a team. The challenge you experienced in St Louis was handled beautifully by their staff and followed up by our Leadership as they paid for the room nights directly. We appreciate your loyalty to Marriott and look forward to a long and successful relationship.
0	very old place. It was okay bed bed was soft pillows were hard the toilet seat was small. The interior was 1950s era and in dis repair. Has no services no Wifi or breakfast served. Super 8 in Peru is much better at least they give you something to eat in the morning. If you need a cheap place to stay this place... More
0	First and last stay at Marriott. First impressions last forever. This was my first time staying at a Marriott hotel. I booked our room months in advance of our arrival date. Arrived at 4:10 p.m. and room was not ready. Took 3 people to confirm the room was NOT ready. Spent 12 mins waiting to get a room. No upgrade was offered or same style room we originally booked was offered. Was given a standard room with a 30.00 discount. The room was OK, however the beds were very small for double occupancy and way too high off the floor! No complementary Internet or coffee was offered. No free breakfast either. Do yourself a favor and book at a Hilton/Hampton hotel. You will get more amenities for a lot less . I could have stayed 2 nights at a Hilton/Hampton for what I paid 1 night for at Marriott.Lilac,Creating a Brilliant Experience is our top priority and we apologize for missing that mark during your stay. I understand how important is to receive the room type requested and have a room ready at the scheduled check in time. We have addressed this issue with our employees to ensure that this situation will be avoided in the future. Thank for taking the time to give your feedback and we will continue to improve our overall hotel operation.
0	Overpriced and under quality. The staff seemed to be nice. Internet quality was excellent. My non-smoking room reeked of cigarette stink. TV reception was terrible. I can not comment on the free breakfast since I was unable to participate.
0	Not worth it! Airconditioners DON'T work, stay somewhere else!. The only benefit to this hotel is its location being near Holiday World! I paid 175 for night for my kids and me to stay here. When I called they didn't have anything left except a suite. I'm still not sure how it was a suite, but I do know that this place is most definitely a rip off. The... More
1	I'd go back. Great location. Near everything. Nice pool and hot tub. Breakfast was ok. Coffee was not good but there is a seven eleven across the street. Don't be put off by the occasional homeless person on the boardwalk as they keep to themselves and leave during the day. All in all a very good place. Thank you for taking the time to write Ocean Park Inn a review. We appreciate your feedback and tips on our property to future guests as I'm sure they will find this helpful. We are so happy to hear that you will be returning back to us. We're looking forward to providing you with another great trip whenever you're in the area.
0	Horrible hotel dont waste money. The pictures were dirty with brown stuff, the beds were awful, toliet, tub, sink were all dirty, tv dirty, pool furniture was plastic and broke. The most disgusting place ive ever stayed. There is no breakfast except juice, coffee, muffins, toast.
1	This is a great place to stay. OK, I am a budget traveler so I am not expecting a luxurious room. I cannot understand all the horrible reviews given to this place. I've stayed around the world in many small, dingy rooms, but I have never had a room that I couldn't stay in. After all, if you're in Orlando for a hotel room, maybe you should just stay home--you hardly spend any time in the room anyway. But for 28 a night, this was an incredible bargain. The room was very clean. The door keys take a special touch, but once you figure it out, it worked every time. The desk staff was very friendly and accommodating. The cleaning staff did a great job every day...and worked around all of my girls' stuffed animals. We stayed here 6 nights with my family of 4 and couldn't have asked for a better place at this rate. The location is great--lots of restaurants, close to I-4, close to Sea World. The pool is beautiful (the weather was just a little too cold for us to enjoy the pool). Maybe it's not the most exotic place and could use a few touch-ups...but for this price in Orlando it's wonderful. If you're expecting a fancy room, this is not the place for you, but if you like a great deal, I would highly recommend it.
0	Every Negative Thing You've Read is TRUE.. From the tattered mattresses to the joke of a breakfast, this place is the place of bad dreams. Which is exactly what I kept having when I realized our door DIDN'T LOCK PROPERLY. The only positive thing about this place was that the front desk person was polite and courteous.
1	Very Under Rated Hotel, Excellent Staff, GREAT Location. I stayed at this hotel because we were going to an event at Philips Arena. I would not hesitate again to stay at this hotel. The staff was VERY friendly, helpful and knowledgeable of the area.10 parking fee is the only negative but our car was safe (over all)...We were within walking distance of several places to eat and this is a fine place. There are NICER places but for the value, it was great.Other rooms during this weekend were 130 and up and I got ours for 80wingslogo84,Thank you for your review. I'm glad to read that you enjoyed your stay. We hope to see you again when you next travel to Atlanta. Since your stay, we have been actively working to improve our services, responsiveness, and the functionality of our products to ensure things are operating as they should. We have been updating and upgrading our rooms and the general appearance of our property. I hope you have safe travels in the future. Sincerely,Enoch D.
0	Good location, but hotel is lacking. The location of the hotel is convenient to downtown Atlanta, and the cost of the hotel is reasonable. However, one of the elevators was broken and staff said that it had been out of order for 3 weeks. This meant using the stairs, and my room was on the 8th floor. My room lacked a shower curtain, coat hangers in the closet, and was not clean when I arrived.Dear David C,I appreciate the review of your recent stay at our hotel. Im very sorry that we fell short of your expectations. My apologies on your experiences with the elevator. Shortly after you checked out the repair work had been completed. Unfortunately the required parts are no longer manufactured so custom pieces had to being fabricated causing a longer then anticipated repair time.Again, I do apologize for the inconveniences and I hope you give us another chance to serve you when your travels bring you back to our area. Please know that we value your business and will work hard to earn your trust once again. If you should have any further questions, please feel free to contact me directly.Hospitably Yours,Andrew May General Manager
1	great hotel, lovely rooms with great views. firstly try to park at the front (not the side) of the hotel if you can or in the garage which has direct access to the casinothe smoke from the casino floor doesn't tend to filter into the lifts and upper floors unlike in some of the downtown casinosthe rooms are very large and well appointed. those facing west have a great view of the las vegas stripwe got an early check in at noon which was good and the process was handled in a friendly but efficient way. ac in room was very efficient and the rooms were quiet when we were therelots of eating choices in the casino and surrounding area but you do need a car in order to take advantage of this as the distances and temperatures make walking a difficult optionhowever the local bus does appear to go to the airport on a regular basis and the casino also offered a shuttle there as wellrecommended
1	Great Getaway !!. What a great find.. beautiful grounds,lots of different plants etc. The two restaurants were both very tasty and the prices were within reason..The Mustang for dinner has some nice craft brews on draft which was a plus.Complimentary coffe in the breakfast / lunch restaurant.Great relaxing pool area , staff was super friendly. Will certainly coming back soon..Thank you for taking the time to share such positive feedback with us on Trip Advisor. We are ecstatic to hear you enjoyed both Mustangs Burros and Adobe El Restaurante. We are also very pleased to hear your complements on the staff and will be sure to pass them along. We hope to have the honor of welcoming you back soon!
0	No ice. We stayed here on October 9-12 and the entire weekend the ice machines and soda machine on our floor was out of order. I did not check the other floors' soda machines. The parking was 12 a night and very tight for out Yukon XL. The breakfast was good and the beds were comfortable. Dear Guest,Thank you for going online and completing our survey. I would like to apologize for the ice machine on your floor not working, we are working on making sure this doesn't happen again. Sorry for this inconvinence . Your feedback is appreciated and very important to us. We were glad to here you still enjoyed our hotel and hot breakfast. We hope you visit us again soon.Warm Regards,Laura BensonOperation Manager619-881-4004
1	Citrus Bowl and Disney Visit. This is an excellent place to stay! The rooms were clean and comfortable. The staff is friendly and helpful. We would definitely stay there again if we visited the Orlando area. It is 5 minutes from the airport and there are several good restaurant choices nearby. The breakfast they offer guests is very good.Thank you for your wonderful words regarding your stay at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport. We are happy that you were pleased with your room and our friendly staff. We appreciate you highlighting our location and our breakfast facility in your review. We are glad that your stay was enjoyable and that you plan to return. See you soon and safe travels! All the Best,Debra Thompson-FrenchGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport
1	Would not stay anywhere else when in the area. Upon returning to the north Phoenix area I did not hesitate in staying at this hotel again, and it didn't disappoint. Check in was friendly and efficient, and our room was clean with ample space, storage, mirrors and power outlets. The bed was comfortable and there was minimal outside noise. The free wifi was faultless in all areas of the hotel. The breakfast and 5:30 kickback were very good, with plenty of choice for even the fussiest eater like me! The hotel itself has been well maintained and appeared spotless. Excellent value for money. Will most definitely stay again.I would also like to thank the hotel staff who found and kept safe my friends credit card which was left behind in our room after check out.
1	Conveniently Located City Hotel. This is a nice boutique hotel with the usual Kimpton style. The hotel is conveniently located in the Loop, within walking distance of all major attractions. The bed was super comfortable and the room quite clean. In typical Kimpton style, fruit infused water and iced tea are available in the lobby, prosecco and / or Aperol Spritzes are served from 5-6, and a chocolate sampling is available on Saturday. More good - a nice bar, ample sitting room, and a great staff... shout out to Mariah at the front desk... she's great. Two issues - (1) the bathroom is crazy small... I had a bigger one in NYC... and (2) we were out of the room from 9-3:30 and the room wasn't cleaned... After contacting the hotel they promptly cleaned the room and sent some goodies to appologize. Overall, I think this is a great property and look forward to visiting again.Thanks for the comprehensive review of our hotel! I'm pleased to see there were several aspects of your stay that you enjoyed and that you were able to take advantage of some of our offerings. Should your travels bring you back to Chicago, feel free to reach out to me directly and I can get you in a room with a larger bathroom to ensure maximum comfort! As for housekeeping, I would suggest letting us know when you prefer service when you arrive so we can best arrange a time with housekeeping during the busy summer season. Thanks again for choosing our hotel and we look forward to seeing you sometime in the future!Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager

For our 75.68 Hotel room for one night we walked into the room and my girlfriend walked into the bathroom and the toilet was not working properly, then she went to turn on the bath and bugs were crawling around in it.

1	A good place to stay in a pinch. I needed a place to stay near Old Town, San Diego and selected the Best Western Seven Seas. Yes, It is a bit outdated, but a good value for the money. I need to say that when I booked, Comic Con was going on in San Diego. So, I was left with few choices. Best Western Seven Seas came through. This time my stay was great. The room was fine. I was able to use their shuttle bus to take us to Old Town and pick us up afterward. Hotel staff are pleasant and willing to assist. The restaurant is good. No complaints.Dear Carlos G.,Thank you for your recent stay with us and for taking the time to write a review. It was nice to hear your kind remarks regarding our great value, helpful staff, our onsite restaurant and our convenient location. We're glad to read that you were able to take advantage of our complimentary shuttle service. We look forward to welcoming you back on your next trip down to San Diego.Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management Staff
0	Great location. Poor customer service.. Not pleased. Poor experience. Will definitely stay somewhere else next time. 7 day/6 night stay...zero cleaning despite numerous requests, no fresh towels or linens entire week other than towels/soap/toilet paper we helped ourselves to from nearby cart. overflowing garbage cans were finally put in hallway day 4.Dear RobinsU9085vk,Thank you very much for taking the time our of your day to review our hotel and share your stay with us. I very much appreciate the feedback and I am very sorry to hear about the poor costumer service you experienced.

We do appreciate your business. Sincerely,Jonathan
1	Great every time. I've been taking my wife here for her birthday for the past 5 years. We stay either 5 or 6 days. Great location, great service. The desk staff are always helpful. Usually we get to take the Bentley for a ride to the Frick or another museum. That's a special treat for me. Last year they put us in a temporary room so we could take a nap until our reserved room was ready, then they upgraded us to a suite which was OMG. I couldn't believe how nice they were. We start every morning with the butler service coffee and something my wife packs for us. We are already looking forward to our stay in December 2016 and we just got tickets to The Comet to complement our stay. Oh, I forgot to mention it's an easy walk to Broadway and 5th Avenue shopping. I tried booking for December 2017 but it's still too early but I will book as soon as they let me.Dear ms2020, We were delighted to have you stay with us at The St. Regis New York and are thrilled to hear that you had an enjoyable experience.We aim to offer our guests a chic home away from home while they sojourn in the city and are delighted to have had you at the property!Thank you for taking the time to review the hotel on TripAdvisor, and we will see you in December!Please contact me directly at octavia.margineanstregis.com and I might be able to arrange your 2017 trip as well. Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager
1	Nice art deco hotel in downtown Chicago with a great location. The Kimpton Hotel Allegro is a recently renovated older but well maintained Art deco hotel with an excellent location in the downtown/loop area of Chicago. Hotel features funky styling, rooms are small but tasteful in design and layout. Think NYC or European size small with respect to rooms. Clean, comfortable bed, fridge/mini bar in room with in room safe. No coffee makers in the room, but coffee and tea and newspapers available in the lobby, even at 5 am. Nice. Comfortable seats in lobby. Free wifi is available if you are an IHG member or join IHG rewards club. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Complimentary drink (Proseco or Sangria) upon check in. Nice touch. Check in is on the second floor Starbucks on ground floor. There is valet parking, but its pricey. You can park across the street in public lot. Prearrange with Spot Hero to save yourself some money. Great location within walking distance of many great attractions, shopping and restaurants. If youre in the mood for Chicago deep dish pizza, the mecca of deep dish, Lou Malnatis is a short walk (8-10 min) down the street away on North Wells. Millenium Park, Art Institute of Chicago, great shopping all close by and within easy walking distance. Overall, good value for the money and would recommendGlad we nailed it and we look forward to seeing you again soon!
0	Memorial Day Getaway. Very dissatisfied with the staff and the lack of caring about at least 5 different guest (that we know of) not being able to check in until after 5:00 pm because rooms weren't ready. It's a Holiday weekend you would think they would be staffed a little better. They are less than a mile away from a theme park and should no how busy they would be especially on a holiday.
0	no recomendable. no hubo agua caliente ninguna de las 3 noches que nos hospedamos. Nos quejamos reiteradamente con el gerente y no brindo ninguna solucion.
0	My stay. The pictures of the hotel looked better on line. The staff was ok not great. No one looked like they wanted to be there. It was supposed to be a non smoking hotel but someone on my floor kept smoking which was a turn off. The room was clean but they didn't leave conditioner or moisturizer and left one teeny shampoo. When I went to the front desk to ask for products I was told they only had a few! Was. It pleased with our stay at all
1	Airport. I am a Hhonors member so picking this hotel was easy, main reason was that it was very close to the airport and they provide a shuttle service, the property was very nice and had everything you would need, their own restaurant or you could chose one of the many other restaurants very close byBeing a Hhonors member we were glad you chose our hotel for your stay due to us being conveniently located close to the airport and also being a Hilton. Thank you for appreciating our hotel and mentioning few of the many amenities we offer to our guests like the shuttle service and our own restaurant. I am glad you recognized the many restaurants located in the area around us. We are grateful to you for sharing this review here for our online viewers to read. Thank you for your loyalty and we would love to serve you again. Sincerely,Alex BlancoGeneral Manager
1	Go ahead, get room service!. The Seattle Grand Hyatt gets high points for location and room quality. You can ignore the complaints about the price of parking, because there is no need to bring your car here. All of the downtown attractions are within easy walking distance, as are the train to the airport, light rail to Lake Union, the monorail to the Seattle Center, and buses to pretty much everywhere else. If you're allergic to transit, the hotel will call a cab or car service for you. And if you truly enjoy driving in traffic, there are cheaper places to park nearby. Be sure to ask the concierge for information on discounts to museums and events. If you want to work out, the gym is fabulous, with lots of high-quality cardio and weight equipment. Bring your swimsuit so you can enjoy the sauna, steam room, and whirlpool. And, although as a rule I don't believe in room service, especially in a city with such good local restaurants, the breakfast that we ordered in-room compared favorably to the best food we had anywhere else - good fresh fruit, excellent bread, local cheese, perfectly-cooked eggs delivered hot, top-of-the-line condiments and a not-too-sweet yogurt parfait. Really, you can trust me. It's worth it.
1	Nothing bad but nothing great. Stayed as part of our honeymoon trip for 3 nights. Checked about 10pm, wasnt the most friendly of greetings but hey. Had requested a high floor room, would have been nice to be wished a happy honeymoon but never mind. Asked when checking in if we had to pay for a safe or if it was in the room as we had a lot of flight tickets, money, credit cards, passports, iPads etc with it being a long trip, told it was in the room. Got to the room, no safe, rang down and spoke to the guy who checked us in who said oh yeah there is no safe in that room, a bit exhausting after a long flight from NY. Moved rooms which was fine, a bit small so no space for our luggage but a good spacious bathroom and the room was modern and clean. Reception staff quite disappointing, I have worked in hospitality and it wouldnt take much to say:- youve obviously just arrived, do you need help with eating tonight - we had never been to the city and being 10pm at night were unsure of where to go- we dont serve breakfast, do you need some recommendations- (when checking out with 4 suitcases) do you need a taxiNot much of an effort to help make our stay a little easierGood location, nice hotel, few niggles let it down
0	One Night Stay on our way to Texas. Since I got a really good deal on Priceline, I was not going to right this review, but I just cant help myself as others need to know. We booked at last minute, due to weather conditions, and arrived at 9:15 at night, It had been storming, so my 13 year old daughter and I opted to just order from... More
1	Nice hotel, good location. I stayed in this hotel for work the week of December 17th. The location is attached to Lennox Square mall so it was very convenient to get some last minute Christmas shopping in without having the hassle of driving to/from malls. The hotel is located across the street from Lennox MARTA station and couldn't be easier to get to from the Airport, however it's pretty much a car-kinda-town so unless you plan to be in one location . .I'd drive. The hotel itself was nice with good public rooms and the rooms themself were standard Marriott / Renaissance style. The bedding and bathrooms were good also -- always nice to have a freestanding shower in the bathroom. The only peeve I have really is to be charged for internet connection. In this day -- especially with lower category Marriott brands like Courtyard / Fairfield Inn / Residence Inn not only charging lower but offering free internet -- it's bothersome. Nearby and walkable are plenty of restaurants both inside the mall and along the perimeter so there's no want for eating. I didn't try the hotel restaurants as I'm Platinum and usually have breakfast in the lounge. The lounge itself was fine and served a variety of breakfast foods. The nighttime snacks were a bit scant -- but hey, it's free so can't complain on that!Lastly -- there is a Westin directly across the wide parking lot so if you need to stay in Buckhead and want to be walkable to the mall both will do just fine. JW Marriott though is the only of the two actually connected to the mall whereas the Westin is in the outside of the parking lot.
1	Great Hotel 5 star. We arrived at the hotel hot and tired. The staff was warm and friendly. When they found out we were there to celebrate a special occasion my 50 Birthday they went out of there way to make me feel special. The location of the room overlooked the pool and garden. The room was beautiful, well decorated. The bed was very conferable. I believe the sheets were even a high thread count . I liked the fact that is was only 3 blocks from the excitement Bourbon Street. This made it very convenient for walking. Plan on walking everyplace. There is lots to do and see. Defiantly walk to Cafe Dumont for Cafe Au Lait and a Beignets are a must. Walk along the fresh market for some fine shopping and walk along the Mighty Mississippi and look out over the water. The hotel is close enough to get to the action but far enough away that when it is time to sleep you don't have to deal with the noise. The hotel courtyard and fountain with a nice pool is a great place to be outdoors. Continental breakfast had a great variety of choices including eggs, and a pleasant dining room overlooking the courtyard and pool. Before you leave you must stop by Clover Grill on 900 Bourbon Street for the worlds best breakfast you will ever eat. If you are going to New Orleans and need a place to stay don't hesitate choose this hotel you won't regret it.
1	Loved the room, hated the parking and no bellhops. Although my hotel rooms was great and the location was great there were a few things that will cause me not to return. The PARKING which they charged me 16 a day was horrible. The spots are so small that compact cars barely fit much less an intermediate or an ever so popular SUVs. Everyone went over the line making it impossible to find a spot and if you were lucky enough to find a spot and get into it, you couldn't get out of your car, most of the time it took me 15-30 minutes to park just because of the lot. The other thing I didn't like was no help with bags. They provided you with carts, but then there were stairs you had put your things in a dummy elevator and send them up or down and being an older person the maneuvering of the cart itself was cumbersome.
0	Cold, Bugs, Rude. Arriving at this hotel we had an open mind, this surely changed within the next hour of our stay. We checked in at roughly 10 PM, this process took a drooling 15 minutes at least. The two staff members had a hard time finding my reservation that was booked 3 days before through Hotels.com. We finally received our key, drove... More
1	Nice hotel no complaints. I stayed at the Drury Inn checking in on July 4th and stayed 4 nights. This hotel is clean and well maintained. The people that work here ALL seem to be friendly and helpful. Check in was painless. I was able to check in early before noon. The breakfast is nice. They have more than the average hotel breakfast. Eggs, sausage, biscuits, Oatmeal, potatos, waffle makers along with the normal fruit, cold cereral, yogurt type items. The afternoon kick back food is nice. Hot dogs,, check tenders, etc. This hotel is perfect for a large family with lots of kids. You can save money with the free meals and drinks. The free drinks are nice, not a big selection alcohol wise. A few types of wine and beer, vodka, bloody marys, tonic water, orange juice is about the extent of the alcohol. Its free, so just go with the flow!! Popcorn and pop in the afternoon also. Our room was on the 8th floor facing Carondelet street and had a nice view. Not much street noise. Room had double beds and was nice. High ceilings and large windows. Comfy beds. No exhaust in the bathroom. Housekeeping met expectations. The hotel is on Poydras which is in the business district so you will have to walk to get to the action of Canal street and the French Quarter. French quarter was about 5 or 6 blocks straight up Carondelet. We walked it LATE at night/EARLY morning and had no problem. Didn't feel unsafe. Trolley car line is at the corner. Stadium is about 5 or 6 blocks up the street. They have 2 computers in the lobby with printers. I had no problems with them. Also an ATM. 3 ATM charge. Nice sitting area to relax in the lobby and downstairs. The location isn't THAT bad. If you want to see a lot, then there will be a lot of walking or trolley riding. Cabs are plentiful and the front desk will call you a cab which I recommend. Unless you are VERY picky, high class type and expect EVERY little thing to be perfect, just about anyone should like this hotel and be satisfied. Its not 5 star Sheraton fancy, but not a Motel 6.
1	Great hotel, but avoid the 8th floor if you don't like dogs.. Great hotel for the price and in a perfect location. Stayed in room 911 (very spacious and a cool view of the pool area). Pets are welcomed on certain floors. Walking distance from several restaurants, clubs, the convention center, and the baseball stadium. The staff is very friendly and ready to help with anything you need.Thanks for a nice review TN! What did you think about the San Diego weather in August, particularly coming from Missouri at that time. Pretty nice huh! :) Hopefully you get a chance to come back and visit again real soon. Thanks for staying with us.
1	Great Value...Great Location. We stayed two nights. The hotel is deceptive from the outside - it looks very plain and ordinary but it is just the opposite on the inside. The lobby is very attractive and welcoming. The room was clean, comfortable and large with vaulted ceilings and very tastefully decorated. We enjoyed the happy hour with three free alcoholic drinks each and hot and cold snacks. Breakfast was also included - fairly typical choices of cereal, scrambled eggs etc.. The staff were very friendly. It's in a great location - the cable car stops out front and it's an easy 5 minute walk to Bourbon St. We will definitely stay here again.
0	Needs better maintenance. Room 246 Still had the last tenants clothing.Exterior Door jam was busted.Loud construction nearby.Pillows were very small.Room was very dark.Remote did not workSmall shower only.Moved to room 305Bathroom door did not shut.A/C unit made rattle noise.Room keys did not work after first night, has to get new keys.Nice big pillows!Plenty of light!Hotel over sells parking lot. Double parking of cars in the lot. Must leave keys with front desk so that they can juggle cars, which lead to damage to our car.Thank you Mark for taking the time to review our hotel on TripAdvisor. We have taken your comments very seriously and are working to improve our facilities for future guests. We appreciate you staying with us and hope you will come back again soon to see our improvements.
1	Our New Favorite Hotel In Phili. Everything was great, staff is wonderful, Misha at front desk was so helpful! So glad I picked this hotel to celebrate my husbands birthday. Loved our room-was a corner room with 2 queens, very comfortable. Favorite part was the lobby, just a great place to hang out, nice bar, fun games, music at night, really cool area. We will be back!Mich, MISHA is amazing! We are glad you chose our hotel for the B-Day celebration and that we took good care of you. Of course you don't have to wait for his birthday to come back, we can help write a new Rx if needed: Phillies, Bell, Parkway, Casino, Shopping, Kimmel Center, Concerts, Theater, just to name a few :) See you soon! Evan (Misha's biggest fan)
0	Needs a good cleaing.... Staff is freindly and knowledgeable. However, it is overlooked by the poor house keeping. When I found hair and the smell of perfume on the sheets and comforter I immediately requested freshly washed linens. The chair I was giong to use appeared not to have been dusted in a couple of months, stains on just about every item... Strangely, the... More
0	Good brand, but poor uptake. Overall we are Marriott Gold Elite members and have the Marriott credit card so we really do Marriott all the time but this is one of the locations that has very poor upkeep. Our room had a funny mold smell and the sink and shower did not drain properly there was the toilet paper roll that was broken a picture frame was not mounted correctly and fell to the floor. The microwave was mounted not at a level. And the list goes on...Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts regarding this issue. We appreciate you bringing it to our attention. We will share your message appropriately within the organization. Edgar RiveraGeneral Manager
1	What a pleasant surprise. We were in Miami to visit family and had stumbled across this motel via the web and felt between the unique look and great location, it was worth a gamble. We were not disappointed. In fact, if it was not for one item, we would have rated the motel excellent.I told my wife that this motel was like an oasis amidst the neighborhood commercial buildings. The amount of landscaping around the pool area and rooms provided a sense of privacy and relaxation. It has an old fashioned look from the outside, which is repeated within the rooms themselves. The rooms were plenty large, the bed was very comfortable, the air-conditioning kept us comfortable, even though we faced the hotter western sun. And the sound-proofing was such that we could barely notice the music being played at night at the pool bar. The shower is quite large, but is also the source of my complaint. During showers, water would go from comfortable to very hot to very cold, even though we had not touched the settings. If you waited a few seconds, the temperature would go back to normal, but it was a true annoyance. I agree the continental breakfast was slim, but was very pleased to see that it was constantly restocked very often. And the best part was the coffee. My wife is so tired of watered down hotel coffee. She really enjoyed the morning brew and that is saying something.Every staff member we came in contact with was friendly and helpful. As noted, the restaurant is currently closed for renovation, which was a disappointment as our family had told us how enjoyable it is. Also, please note that parking is in a horseshoe shape on the outside edge of the building. We had no concerns about the neighborhood, but would certainly advise against having anything of value visible in the car. Would we stay here again Absolutely yes, but we would hope that the shower issue has been resolved in the future.Thank you so very much for your feedback and so glad you truly enjoyed your stay. Hopefully you will be returning sooner rather than later. We do service our heaters on an annual basis even though they are relatively new and in fact they were serviced less than a month ago which is why I am quite irritated that you experienced temperature fluctuations in your room. Another service call has been made and the issue will be dealt with promptly.By the way, we always advise guests not to leave valuable items in their cars anywhere in Miami.
0	One Star is one too many!. This hotel is horrible for so many reasons that I don't even know where to begin. The location is on a very busy street called Orange Blossom Trail. When we arrived, we needed to make a left turn in order to get to the parking lot of the Hotel. Making that left turn seemed nearly impossible and very dangerous! The traffic on Orange Blossom makes getting in and out of the parking lot seemingly impossible and we almost had an accident! We checked into room 284...on the 2nd floor and had tons of luggage because we were in town for a Fashion Show. Low and behold, the hotel has NO elevators! What!! How do you operate a hotel that has a second floor with no elevators The guy at the front desk almost laughed out loud when he told us there were no elevators...not because it was funny but because he too, thought it was ridiculous! We had to lug heavy bags up the stairs only to get there and find that the room was horrible. There was a musty moisture in the air as soon as we walked in and the room felt very stale and unclean. The walls had been caulked to fill in several holes and I do mean SEVERAL HOLES but they didn't even attempt to match the paint. The wall was painted yellow but the caulked portion was painted over with orange. The sheets and comforters on both beds had yellow stains and brown stains all over. The carpet was stained, possibly with urine because it smelled heavy with urine near the stain. The bathroom looked very old and cheaply constructed with peeling paint and stained walls. The hotel was pet friendly but I don't think they spray regularly for fleas because we all had flea bites after only being in the room for a few hours. The halls smelled really bad and especially in the stairwells. One huge thing that stood out was that there were several young women, dressed very scantily, walking up and down the street in the area near the hotel in the late evenings. I do believe there was heavy prostitution in the area and this hotel and other hotels in the area are used for that purpose. We decided that we could not sleep comfortably in this hotel and checked out the same night. The weekend that we were in town was a busy weekend due to the All Star event so most hotels were booked solid. We searched and searched and found a hotel with only one room left! We booked it, packed up and high tailed it out of there! Ended up approximately 2 miles away at a Hampton Inn Suites where we re-showered, and slept comfortably in clean beds! Never again will I stay at a Baymont! We booked here for two reason...because the group we were in town for had blocked several hotels for their fashion show and this was one of them and number two, because most hotels in the area were already sold out. I will never stay at a Baymont EVER again!
1	A comfortable hotel in a great location. Bad: Couldn't find fault with anything. Good: It might sound strange to say that I was ill in bed for most of my stay but still gave the hotel top ratings!. However, the room was extremely comfortable and clean. The staff were very helpful and pleasant and the location was great. We were in the annex which fronts onto Ocean Drive and there was a very good cafe/bar below. I found out towards the end of the stay they also did room service. Wish I had been well enough to take advantage of this great little hotel.
0	Third and last!. This was the third year we have stayed at this particular hotel while attending an event for my daughter. The previous two years were enjoyable stays. This year was terrible. The television and internet did not work most of the weekend. Went down to breakfast and was told there was no juice because they were not prepared for the number of guests. The lobby, walkway in front of the elevators, and dining area were torn up the entire weekend. I am shocked that renovations would be planned during a busy weekend. So very disappointed! Got a great rate, but I guess you get what you pay for.Dear S6674SGamandac,Thank you for taking the time to give our business the Wingate by Wyndham Atlanta Galleria feedback. I apologize for the inconvenience you experienced while staying at our Wingate hotel. I have discussed this situation with my entire management staff to ensure that it is not repeated. The condition of internet and television was unacceptable, but because of your feedback we did take care of both situations. Our goal is to provide a level of service that requires diligent attention to detail and is a matter of constant reinforcement of our hotel. Once again, we are truly sorry for any inconvenience we caused you. If there is anything else we can assist you with in the future, please don't hesitate to call. We look forward to having you as our guest in the future.Tremeil BooneFront Office ManagerWingate by Wyndham
1	Overwhelmed with happiness!. The hotel is nice, the bunk bed room is the best for a family. Our kids were so excited to have their own room and bunk beds. The pool and hottub were fun too. Breakfast is decent too. But what sold me is the customer service! I will go back. I left a very expensive toy realized it after a 10 hour drive home. They were SO HELPFUL, housekeeping, front desk, everyone. I just got it in the mail less than a week after our stay. THANK YOU COMFORT SUITES!We sincerely appreciate your feedback that you and your family enjoyed your stay with us so much. I am happy your children enjoyed their stay with us too, in their own part of your room with their special bunk beds! Many of our guests with children state the bunk beds combined with their own area make the children feel very at ease while traveling. Our staff is also very pleased that you mentioned them in your review too. Often the things they do to ensure our guests have a pleasant stay are done in the background and not always noticed by our guests, so it was very rewarding for them to see your comments. We were only too glad that we found the item you left in your room and that were able to return it to you safely. We are honored that you value our staff and commitment to customer service and we look forward to you staying with us again in the future. Sincerely, Elizabeth Ming
0	No hot water, bath tub malfunction. It was a terrible experience, could not take a shower, the bath tub was full of water, and the room smells. I complained to the manager on duty, i took three hours to fix the hot water and five hours to fix the bath tub
1	Grand Hyatt Seattle. Recent trip to Seattle and stay at Grand Hyatt were great. The hotel is clean and the staff were all very welcoming. The location of the hotel could not have been better. The convention center is close by and shopping is right outside the door. It is within walking distance to the Pike Place Fish MarketThank you for the review on your stay at the Grand Hyatt Seattle. We pride ourselves on providing the best customer service and we are pleased to hear that you encountered this during your stay! We are located just a few blocks from some major attractions, but we are very close to public transportation as well as great shops and restaurants. We look forward to welcoming you back in the future.Brenna N.Guest Relations Manager
1	Good but not an impressive 5 stars hotel.. The JW is well-located within Buckhead, attached to Lenox Mall which is great for shopping. The amenities provided are comprehensive but the rooms are a bit dated and the other Marriott across the street is quite frankly just as good for about 30 less a night.Overall I would say this hotel is great but nothing impressive or really spectacular here. The service is the only thing I would say that stands out.Thank you for your post. I am glad that you found the hotel convenient and the service levels exceeded your expectations. The JW Marriott Service levels are truly what set us apart from Marriott Hotels, Conference Centers and Resorts. Thank you for your feedback regarding your guest room. We take all comments very seriously for future planning. I hope you will plan to visit again.
0	Stay Away!. Hotel room was filthy dirty. Room had heavy odor of mildew (and my allergies indicated mold was a real problem in the room.) Toilet had issues, even after I reported it to management and they said they fixed it. Door had no deadbolt -- only a push button lock to secure the door. Bedding was dirty. Room had not been... More
0	Never stay where you see No Refunds. If you love trains you will be able to hear them all night long as they blare their horn and roar past the motel! If you're a fan of thin pillows and rock hard beds you are home. On a positive note, the room was clean and the towels were soft. NOT worth 60!
1	Short walk to Union Square. We stayed at Hotel Diva for three nights on our first trip to San Fransico. When we were headed to our room in the elevator a guest made a comment that the rooms were small so we were expecting that when we opened the door, but were pleasantly suprised. The room we had was quite a reasonable size with king bed, small dining table and office desk as well as enough space to have our two large suitcases open on the floor. The bathroom was however one of the smallest I have seen although fine for a few nights stay. The rooms felt clean and the bed was comfortable. Decor felt a little dull due to all the silver and grey, not a lot of colour. Located only a short walk, 2 blocks to Union Square. First time visitors I would recommend this hotel for your holiday, and would certainly consider returning here. Staff were knowledgable and helpful.Dear KJWAust,Thank you for your feedback. I am glad to hear your enjoyed your stay in our hotel as well as in San Francisco. We can't wait to see you again in the future. Sue LaoGuest Services Manager
0	Nasty front desk. Staying at this hotel on business, every week I need my folio sent. 90 days later, the same person at the front desk Janelle, is a mean and nasty person. I have a dozen other co-workers staying here as well. She treats everyone poorly. We are tired of writing letters, and will all be finding other accomodations for December. You'd think after 3 months she would at least do the work. She thoroughly enjoys being difficult. DO NOT STAY HERE IF YOU NEED ANY ASSISTANCE. Sad how one person can soil an otherwise decent experience.Thank you for your feedback regarding your experience, and for speaking with me on the phone last week. We have a great staff and so the review certainly caught me by surprise. I have personally addressed the person you mentioned and I can assure you that she had no intention of disrespecting you, and only wanted to help with the special billing arrangements. Please accept my sincere apologies on behalf of our team, and thanks again for bringing this to my attention.
0	worst hotel customer service. Stayed at this hotel with their package deal of renting a room and leaving your car in the parking lot for a price of 159.99 while you fly away. Car was broken into and they refuse to pay for the damages. No responsibility. do not stay here do not trust them.Thank you for your response. Unfortunately, the airport market has had a recent wave of car vandalism. With the help of police and third party security monitoring our parking lot, we fortunately have been able to stop these car break-ins. We understand how frustrating this situation is and again would like to extend our apologies. We want you to know that we will continue to work with local police to ensure our hotel, parking lot and city are safe.
1	Good stay. Great neighborhood. Easy freeway access. We stayed in double queen. It was very spacious. The neighborhood was great. Felt very comfortable there. It's a nonresidential area by the freeway with restaurants nearby. The freeway was a little loud in the mornings and there was some construction going on right outside the hotel. They should be done with the construction there in about a week. It woke us up very early one morning. I told the manager about it and he was happy to switch our rooms if we wanted. We chose to stay in the same room. It was less noisy the next morning without the jackhammer going. The kids even enjoyed watching the big excavator going. The even numbered rooms may be less noisy. Breakfast was decent. Scrambled eggs, sausage, potatoes, waffles, cereal, and donuts. The indoor pool is small. It would maybe fit 15-20 people. There were 12 people when we went and was already getting crowded. Exercise room has an elliptical and recumbent bike only. The staff were very nice. We would stay there again.
1	Another Spectacular Stay!. Just had another spectacular stay at my favorite hotel in Seattle the Sorennto. I was in town to attend the annual Bumbershoot festival, and I wouldnt dream of staying anywhere else. The level of service here is nothing short of stellar. I cant thank Lisa and her team enough for handling my myriad requests. And every department went out of their way to personally greet me during my stay which of course is no surprise because this hotel is truly a home away from home gem. Cant wait to come back!Dear Troy,Thank you taking the time to share your recent return visit to Hotel Sorrento, on TripAdvisor, with other travelers.I was delighted to read that enjoyed the Bumbershoot Festival and found our hotel and team top notch and successfully able to resource any requests that you had.No need to dream of any other location in Seattle, we want you back! Please allow us to coordinate your return visit and personally oversee any requests that you may have. Warmest regards.Shannon Sheron, Managing Director
1	Best in SF. In a city not known for sumptuous hotels, the St Regis is the local maximum. We stayed in a large, well-appointed suite with a nice view. We were somewhat disappointed by the fact that rooms are on the lower half of the bldg, as the upper half is reserved for residents. The result is that the W just down the street, while not of the same caliber, has infinitely better views. So, ask for floors 14-20. Below that, it s just too low.Second point of criticism - and this applies to all St Regis butlers: they creep us out! These guys need to be less awkward / better trained / older than 15. Now, for the good stuff: Nice pool area, very good spa treatments, and a rather hopping and pleasant lobby bar. The Japanese restaurant was also rather on the nice side. The location is obviously fantastic, with SF Moma half a block away, and all the shops a couple of blocks away.Overall, a relaxing St Regis - not their best hotel, but definitely the best in San Francisco.
0	Dirty, overpriced. Pigsty. Room wasn't cleaned they claimed to only have smoking rooms available. Rowdy drunks till 3am.
0	Disappointing room and stay. Paying full price while hotel is under construction is not acceptable...newly renovated room was mediocre at best...room only had one chair...no lounge chair ...previously provided when staying there...furniture was cheaply built and made...cleanliness of room was at best just acceptable...found things left behind by former guests...dirty floor...bed was comfortable however...breakfast was just OK...nothing to rave about and certainly not a selling point for me to stay there...staff was very friendly and informative however...would hesitate to stay there again...very disappointing for sure...
0	Shocking experience. Please Read!. We checked in at the Mandarin Oriental in Miami on October 21st we were kindly picked up with a limousine service at the Airport and greeted at the hotel lobby, the front desk assistant was extremely kind and gave us a beautiful room on the 8th floor overlooking the wonderful Brickell bay. We had a lovely Junior Suite given that we made all our reservations through the American Express Platinum Travel Services and of course they have certain perks. So far our experience was really lovely, the reason why we were visiting Miami was because my girlfriend and I were celebrating her birthday and it was her present, aside I took the opportunity of meeting up with few business associates. During the early morning of Monday the 24th of October, I got up from the bed and was hoping to start our day, however as the blinds were totally closed the room was dark and I misstepped on some silky pillows that were on the floor, given that they never came to do the turndown of the room, (usually around 18hrs they remove the silky decorative pillows as well as the covers and prepare the room for sleep). As a result I fell head first broke the fall with my arm groping on the desk in front of the bed where the TV was placed. I was startled from the impact and due to the obvious noise I woke up my girlfriend. Once we turned on the lights we saw that my hand was slightly bruised from the impact and of course since I am not a light guy 110kg of weight the result was an impact against the TV screen which ended up broken. We had informed the room service, and security came to inquire and inspect and make pictures. More concretely 2 security staff and the manager on duty. The security staff asked some questions and provided me with some ice for the hand. They told us that it was a clear trip and fall and they accommodated us. The manager Mr. Hendrik Grebe on the other hand did not show any concern nor did he tried to communicate with us. Security came again minutes later to help us fill in a report and we of course did it following their advice. We were told that they will get back to us for the matter of replacing the tv and whatever else we could need for such incident. The evening of the same day we came back to our hotel room and found that the tv was not replaced nor has the room been made up. Moreover there had not been a single attempt to try to clarify the situation or see if we could need any further help. We contacted the front desk about the tv and we were told that they just dont have a replacement tv, instead I had to request to be moved to a different room. Approximately an hour later they provided us with the same kind of room on a different floor. The day after it was our departure date and I was having breakfast with some business associates at their restaurant and while I was walking my guest out of the Mandarin one of the security staff approached me and said that the manager on duty would like to have a word, which obviously created an awkward moment. Furthermore the manager on duty Mr. Kelvin Jiles came to speak to me and informed me that I was going to be charged 1.300 usd aprox for the tv, given that the manager from the day of the incident reported it as property damage. Of course I did not expect this, nothing was communicated to us, and no one ever made an effort to clarify such a situation. Obviously I had several questions of my own as to why this incident was treated in such a manner with the lack of communicating and unprofessionally of the Mr. Hendrik Grebes part.I was told by Mr. Kelvin Jiles that it would be possible to speak to Mr. Grebe later in the day and requested me to come back at 3pm. However Mr. Grebe never came out to us, instead we spoke to the head of security for the hotel. Previously we were able to read the internal written report supposedly written by Mr. Grebe where he defined the situation as I was caught by a housekeeping staff who brought our breakfast and I declined or pretended I never ordered, later in the report they said it was a mistake from room service obviously I never ordered such a breakfast, on top my girlfriend was referred to as a friend who spent the night in my room, also they insinuated that I could have been drunk, and worse was there could have been a case of domestic violence. That has been the most insulting situation I have ever found myself in not to say how ashamed I was when my girlfriend read such a report. I of course was told by every person who approached to us from the staff that they absolutely understand our disagreement, and confusion of such an absurd situation. They repeatedly told us that the charged were done on my card and kept on apologizing.We are usual costumers of the Mandarin Oriental more concretely we had just been 5 days at their hotel in NYC. We feel horrified at the treatment and lack of professional approach and we still havent been given a proper or justified answer to the events. I hope this long letter helps for any future similar occurrences.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your recent stay about Mandarin Oriental, Miami on Trip Advisor. We have reviewed the information detailing the events that occurred during your stay and your concerns regarding the charges applied to your account. Please understand the health, safety and comfort of our guests is our top priority and our personnel did show concern for your well being as well as that of your guest. While we do understand that accidents happen from time to time there are several statements that conflict with our findings and the lock audits that were done as part of this investigation which do not support that the damages were a result of an accidental trip or fall.We have sent you a separate letter discussing this situation and we hope we can work together in finding an amicable solution. Please call me to further discuss.Sincerely,Jorge GonzalezGeneral Manager

0	Not what it use to be. This was/is my second time staying at this hotel and I will probably never stay again. It was a Residence Inn but I guess the owners opted out of the franchise(or got kicked out) We stayed here about 4 years ago for my anniversary, I guess under different management/owners, we had a lovely stay, nice room, extremely comfortable bed, complimentary...

1	todo bien. Es un buen hotel. Ubicado muy cerca del metro y con servicio de transporte a la estacion gratis cada 30 minutos. El personal muy amable, en especial DANNY Y SAN, quienes son la salvacion de los que solo hablamos espanol. Las habitaciones muy buenas, aunque no lujosas, pero si por encima de las basicas de otros hoteles. al centro son 10 estaciones, no hay pierde pues es la ultima parada de una linea corta. aprox. 40 minutos. el desayuno bueno. En general volveria sin pensarlo y lo recomiendo. No te hacen ningun cargo extra.Si llegas despues de las 10:30 puedes tomar taxi muy facilmente, siempre hay 10 o 20 afuera y te cobran aprox. 10 dolares. A diferencia de otros hoteles un poco mas lujosos se caracterizan por ser muy amables y comprensivos. al frente hay toda clase de restaurantes, supermercados y algunos comercios
0	One Bad Experience - GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. I had stayed there before and gave them a positive review. However, when I went back, they had changed management. The staff is very negative, incompetent, and nasty. There is no shortage of drama. I went 4 weeks without any housekeeping and then the new manager blamed me. I am now staying in another place for now without any drama and my room is cleaned DAILY! Please don't put yourself through this - GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!
1	Good central hotel. The hotel is nice and great location especially if you like Chinese (as China Town is literally next door). Also 5 Min to Union Square. Nice staff very friendly and attentive. Bed is very comfy. We did not have breakfast so I cannot say anything about that. I'm glad your stay left you with a great impression! When you're not out exploring the city, we always want you to feel comfortable in your room and accommodated by our friendly team. If you plan to visit San Francisco again, keep us in mind!All the best,Collins C., Front Office Manager
1	Old but worth staying. We wanted a place within walking distance of Blind Willie's and this hotel got the best ratings on Tripadvisor. It was a great place to stay! The room was clean and comfortable, there was good coffee in the morning and it was not only within walking distance of Blind Willie's but the Jimmy Carter Presidential library as well. Would definitely stay here again.Thank you for your wonderful review! We appreciate your feedback and are happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay. It would be our pleasure to have you as a guest in the future, please come back soon!Thank you,Kristin AndersonAssistant Hotel ManagerThe Highland Inn
0	Nice employees but old and black mold. The staff couldn't have been nicer and the price was fine (no charge for parking too), but the bottom line is that there was black mold all over the bottom of the walls, around and in the air vents of the place were food is...MoreI certainly apologize that you had an issue with our restaurant cleanliness.

1	Ocean-Side Bliss. Two things stand out significantly related to Pantai Inn -- the customer service is beyond beautiful -- literally everthing you need or want is available in an instant, and they are so courteous and creative in their delivery. Second to that, barely, is the stunning view of the ocean and the sound of the waves crashing against the cliffs, punctuated periodically by the compelling barks of sea lions resting along the beach. As if that weren't enough, the location is great, the beds are super comfortable and they have good wine! Go!Greetings aluck2013,Thank you for taking the time to review Pantai Inn. I thoroughly appreciated your acknowledgement of the two specific areas in which we shine. Our team does a remarkable job at ensuring our guests are well taken care of. I cannot fully express how appreciative I am of their efforts. Also, yes you are correct (and you echo most comments that travelers leave) we are in a priceless location to relax and rejuvenate.Your encouragement to other travelers to come and visit was appreciated. Please come back and stay with us again soon! All the best, Mike
1	Quaint old hotel with lots of character and convenient location. I loved our stay at the Bienville House. We had a 4th floor, patio room. The patio was cool, with lots of lush plants and a small table. The room was comfortable and as expected for NOLA not large. The 3 of us had plenty of room. The staff was a bit of a mixed bag but overall nice. The front desk staff were super helpful and very sweet, the valet was great and the departing bell hop as well. The bell hop on arrival seemed pretty stressed. He was the only one working and it was a busy time when we arrived. Also, the lady at the continental breakfast was a bit off putting. You could tell she didn't like the fact I like to fix my own coffee. :) The pool is a great little pool in a nice courtyard. Bienville House is located in a great New Orleans locations. It is an easy walk to Jackson Square, Bourbon Street or Riverwalk. I'll be back! Oh, the lady in the next room seemed alarmed when there was loud music playing upon arrival. One should not expect silence anywhere in the French Quarter. It was simply a Riverboat playing load must and passed withing 20 minutes.Thank you for taking time to review our hotel. We are thrilled you loved your stay and enjoyed your room accommodations. We will be sure to pass along your comments about our staff and will look to improve this aspect of our hotel in the near future. Come back and see us again soon!
0	Blue Sky Motel - a gray experience. I thought this would be a cute, quaint, retro motel but it turned out to be closer to Bates Motel than a Blue Sky experience. The carpet had stains, the pool was broken, there were dogs barking in one of the rooms and there were ants crawling in the bathroom sink. Won't be back.
1	Great hotel in a perfect location. We selected this hotel since we wanted to be in a convenient, but historic part of New Orleans. We were here for a convention and the location was great. Two blocks away is the Riverfront streetcar that goes to the Convention center in one direction and to the French Market in the other.The hotel itself is charming and is within a block or two of House of Blues (which we enjoyed), Bubba Gumps (didn't like as much) and Hard Rock Cafe (didn't even go). Our room was large with two queen beds and overlooked an edge of the courtyard. The beds were soft, but surprisingly comfy. We were able to walk everywhere in the French Quarter including several non-chain restaurants. And the air conditioning was, well, cool... and believe me it's needed after being outdoors! They no longer serve continental breakfasts since they now have a cooking school restaurant downstairs. We had a very nice breakfast there. Dinners looked good and reasonably priced, but we just didn't try it out due to other commitments.There's a fire station across the street and a police station a couple blocks away, so you always felt safe. Didn't hear any sirens -- in fact didn't hear much noise except for an occaisional train. All in all a great place to stay and a good value for those wanting more than an anonymous chain hotel.
1	We would certainly stay with you again! Good location!. Bad: Our room view was pretty poor as it was looking out and into adjacent old building and seeing right into others apartments. Had to totally close blinds for any privacy. That blocked all of the natural lighting. A suggestion or 2: !. Letting people know where their room is located within the facility so they could ask for a different view if it was available. 2. Having blinds that pull up from the bottom (instead of down from the top) would allow some privacy from close buildings and still allow some natural light into the rooms that have this issue). Additionally some kind of break on parking would be a great addition. Our parking costs almost as much as one nights stay!. Good: Social Hour was unexpected and fun. Made some new friends!
0	VERY DISSAPOINTING. We chose this facility based on location and website and offerings. I was VERY disappointed and would not recommend. The suite was unclean with items in disrepair. Ordered a chilled champagne and flutes and had a warm bottle of champagne and dirty flutes upon arrival.
0	Terrible concierge service. I had requested to book a fine dining experience for Easter dinner and instead we were sent to a night club with inappropriate art ( for family dinner) load music and impossible meal experience. A family holiday was ruined by the concierge recommendation. Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to write about your recent experience at Mandarin Oriental, Miami on Trip Advisor.We sincerely apologize the restaurant the Concierge selected was not what you had requested. We will certainly address your comments and also review the selection of restaurants that are recommended to our guests, which are generally the most popular and trendy places in the city in addition to La Mar and Azul that are located at the hotel.I hope you will give us another opportunity and ask you to contact the Executive Office to assist with your next reservation.Sincerely,Jorge GonzalezArea Vice PresidentGeneral Manager
1	THE DC TRIP. Hotel is in the perfect spot at the perfect price with the not so perfect view. Expedia rep said that it was facing the water and in a way it was but at a 45 degree angel past the parking lot and a few other obstructions. You have to stretch your neck at the furthest corner of the window to gain a peak. But it was still good though. The room sleeps like nobody's business. Once your head hits the pillows its light out. What I did not like was the front desk personnel. They really did not like there job and it showed. No eye contact, no smiles, no small talk, and what really disturbed me was at check in when I was told to sign this that's how it was put. I was like what is it Just sign - its nothing. Sir What am I signing. Oh if you have a party and smoke we can charge you 250.00(eyes still on monitor). Well sir. Tell me that. Next. Came back later that night to get snacks out of the cupboard. Over priced but I expected that but the person at the front desk was lifeless and didn't not even give me a total. She just says. Its charged to your room and kept staring at her monitor(again the monitor). WOW. But what makes up for some of the small inconsistencies is that fact that the water is in walking distance. The Ferris wheel is right there and Gaylord Hotel is right across the street. Good energy in the area and great spots to eat(Redstone) . Cant wait to visit again. Thanks for the snacks!
1	A piece of heaven!. We loved our stay at the Ocean Park Inn. We had an ocean front room, and the beach was a few short steps off the boardwalk that ran behind the Inn. Great views of the beach and the ocean. Many amazing restaurants were within walking distance on the boardwalk. We were a little hesitant about staying here based on some of the reviews, but could not have been happier. The staff was so helpful, giving many recommendations for great places to eat, and things to do while we were staying in San Diego. Pat was especially helpful at check-in and throughout our stay. The carpet was a little worn, but the hotel was very, very clean. The bathrooms have been remolded, and were great. Breakfast had a lot of options, and we never went away hungry. There were folks sleeping on the grounds and around the boardwalk, but not one of them approached us, or bothered us in any way. We felt completely safe out walking, even late at night. There is a bar/restaurant on the front side of the Inn, which was loud at night, but we could not hear any of that noise from our room. There was some noise at night from the boardwalk, (skateboarders, people talking) but the location outweighed any nighttime noise. Definitely request an ocean front room. We moved into the city for the last two days of our stay to be nearer the stadium. We missed the OPI and wished we had not moved to the other hotel (which was a great place, just not the OPI). When we return to San Diego, we will definitely stay at the OPI!Thank you so much for all of your wonderful feedback! We are so glad that you enjoyed breakfast and those wonderful ocean views. We also appreciate your kind recognition of our hard working employees. We are so glad to hear that you will be returning to stay with us, we look forward to welcoming you back!
1	Embassy Suites Lithicum-High Quality Great Price. The Embassy Suites Lithicum provided a high quality venue for our youth baseball team as we participated in a tournament that weekend. The team loved the atmosphere and ambiance of this Hilton brand hotel. It is among the nicer hotels that we now stay in due to an experience that we had with the standard accomodations at popular hotel chains such as DI, M6, S8, HJ, etc. The cook to order breakfast was a bonus. My only complaint would be is that it is a loud hotel on the weekend with special events and people constantly hanging out of there rooms on the atrium. It would also be great to at least provide free wireless in the common areas. The fee for wireless was almost 10/day and the business center was always full.
0	There are many better options in San Diego. Here's the short version of my 5 nights at this hotel. King bed was bottomed out on one side..the other side was fine so I just slept on the one good side. No hot water 2nd day for about 2 hours--right after I got back from the gym needed that shower so that put my drive to L.A. back 2 hours. (hair dryer didn't work). There was a leaky ceiling in the lobby dripping into a floor basket--and what ever caused that problem seemed to affect my room water service. When the hot water went down the toilet stopped flushing properly--that lasted 2 days before being fixed. The breakfast here was poor. Each morning there was a basket of black bananas there were the usual sweets (muffins and frosted sugary treats). There was some kind of weird egg that was folded to look like a mini omelette--stuffed with orange cheese. It was kind of rubbery and tasted weird. The potatoes were dry and kind of like tator tots. I just stayed with coffee and juice after the 1st day. There was a front desk person that kept referring to me as boss...no problem boss you got it boss, etc. I thought that was unprofessional and a demeaning term. You may use the term boss on a construction site or road crew, but not in a professional environment. When I checked out the lady at registration didn't even ask how my stay was..or wish me a good trip as I left..I felt she could care less. You have MANY options during your stay in San Diego. So consider your plans before booking here. By the way this hotel is located on a very busy street. Lots of traffic noise as Harbor Drive is a main road traveled coming out of the airport. This whole area is heavily impacted by traffic.
0	STAY FAR AWAY (unless you need a Hook-up). The room we had was part of an adjoining room, and that occupant was smoking(I have asthma, and coughed all night.) Apparently this Interstate Exit is Hook-up Central. As there was LOUD activity on both sides of us all night, and the walls did NOT block ANY SOUNDS- ANY. It was a nightmare, except we were awake and actually experiencing... More
0	Great Stay. Hotel is under renovations and you would not know it the way the staff, front desk and sales treated you. The room was great, much space. I stayed with my son and daughtger in a studio suite and were very comfortable. the hotel is located ina excellent location with easy acess to all surrondings. I would stay they again,
1	Can't wait to return!. Our extended family of 13 had an unbelievably, magical weekend in San Diego visiting Legoland, Sea World and USS Midway. All locations are close with USS Midway only a 12 minute walk.All the staff were incredibly welcoming and super helpful. The Breakfast buffet and room service exceeded our expectations! The waffles were outstanding! Kids menu and pricing were top notch!! Loved the popcorn in the lobby, and the spectacular glass elevator. We travel a lot as a family and this was one of the best experiences!!sharenc870 - Thank you for the amazing review! Our team really enjoyed taking care of your family while you were here and I am so pleased the experience left you with magical memories of both San Diego and our hotel. We can't wait to welcome you back on your next trip. Kind Regards, Alyssa TurowskiGeneral Manager
0	Ewww dirty.. Made a mistake and walked on the carpet with barefeet,, umm flypaper, not quite. Unchanged sheets on 1 of the beds. Poorly cleaned bathroom. Felt dirty till i got home and showered.
0	Never Again!!. This was the most reasonably priced hotel. It is understaffed to say the least. Night desk clerk did not charge me for a roll away I needed for 1 night. This is where the good news ends. Each day we had to ask for something that should have been in our room, towels, shampoo etc. Our last night there, we stood in a long line to ask for the cups that were not replaced during housekeeping. I was given the address to Wal-mart to go and buy my own! During breakfast they ran out of spoons, cereal was eaten with a fork. I wish management would train and hire additional employees for better customer service!
1	Best Weekend Ever!. We stayed at The Pearl a couple summers ago and fell in love with the place - and the burgers! A couple weeks ago my boyfriend surprised me with a trip back to our favorite San Diego hotel. We spent the first night lounging poolside with another fantastic burger dinner and drinks. Brian, our server, made us feel welcome right away and recommended the curried carrot soup to start - not something we would have gone with, but it was absolutely delicious. The following evening at sunset my boyfriend surprised me with a perfect proposal on Sunset Cliffs! Needless to say, we were on cloud 9 when we arrived back at The Pearl. The staff picked up on it right away and made our night so incredibly special. Brian was our server again and excitedly brought us complementary champagne to celebrate. While we had dinner, a couple of the staff snuck into our room (which was totally fine with us) and set up a bucket of champagne, some glasses, and a couple of awesome I The Pearl shirts with a handwritten note of congratulations! The Pearl staff went above and beyond, and these gestures really made an amazing weekend that much better. Their thoughtfulness has become a part of our engagement story, and we can't say enough how much we appreciate all they did for us! Thank you Adrienne, Maggie, Brian, and everyone at The Pearl!PS - Oscar the fish was a great roommate!Thank you very much for the awesome review. First and foremost. Congrats on the engagement!!!! Honored to be part of your celebration. Our burgers are amazing. Look forward to your next visit. Tell a friend.
0	Disappointed. The area was just off a busy freeway in what we described as the stripper neighborhood. I needed early checkin which I arranged months ago. Didn't get it. When we were able to check in noticed wet section if carpet. Thought maybe they cleaned something up. Next morning 1/4 room saturated. Went to front desk. They said probably Ac problem. They said no problem to fix. We left. 6 hours later returned problem not fixed and water is traveling. Went to front desk. They said something like this can't be fixed in a day. What did you expect Odd, I expected it fixed. Can you at least suck up the water No, we can't. Hmmmmm. You will get a new room. I said no, fix it. Our time is limited and on way out soon. They said they'd send someone to look at it. Twenty minutes in the bar (nice bar and staff) went up to room. Maintenance had it fixed in 5 minutes. They placed towels on floor where they stayed until we left. Thank you for your feedback. I apologize that we were unable to fix your air conditioning issue immediately. Through our several interactions with you early in the day, you were offered a room move several times until we could get the resources to fix the leak in your air conditioning. I am sorry that the staff that you spoke with were not more empathetic, but they did offer you alternate accommodations. We try to honor early check in requests, but that is dependent on the departure patterns and how quickly we can clean the rooms for the new arrivals. I hope that this does not prohibit you from joining us again.
1	Great Stay. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. The internet in the room was reliable and easily accessible. The staff were courteous and very helpful. The buffet breakfast was hot and tasty. The shuttle service was reliable and the staff were courteous and helpful.Thank you for taking a moment to share your experience. We are happy to hear that your stay was a great one and that you were treated as deserved. Our entire hotel staff enjoyed catering to your needs. We look forward to welcoming you back to our hotel in the future. At Hilton Garden Inn, we promise to do whatever it takes to ensure you are satisfied. You Can Count On Us. Guaranteed
1	Pretty good stay. Pretty good stay, staff was a bit rude and our room was not ready when we arrived. Other than that, it was a good stay. Would go again in hopes of nicer maid services. The door man was very helpful and kind. Thank you for taking a few minutes to share the details of your recent stay. While I'm pleased you enjoyed your stay and our door man was helpful, I'm disappointed that any team member came across as rude. The team works hard to deliver exceptional service, it's clear we failed with your stay. We will discuss with the team to insure this does not happen further. Thank you for bringing to my attention.WayneGeneral Manager
0	Unhospitable. I am sad to say this place is very unhospitable. At least when I stayed. They advertise a shuttle service Frisco shuttle who are very unreliable. We paid them to pick us up and they were a no show when we finally got someone on the phone the hung up on us. When we called the hotel for help... More
0	Everything was out of service. Unfortunately was a somewhat terrible stay. Right from the get go was warned that the systems were down and would have them up again soon. Was told about other amenities and directed to the room. Come to find out walking by the pool that that was out of order as well. With no wifi since their systems were down I headed to the bar and got a bite a drink. I think everyone was there since no one could get wifi or go to the pool and everyone charging their rooms. The next day at our tradeshow event the wifi was still in and out and their systems were still down. Overall pretty disappointing experience with all of the amenities unavailable. Hopefully they figure it out!Thank you for your feedback, and we apologize for any inconvenience you experienced. Unfortunately, Marriott did have a system outage caused by the hurricane that affected several hundred properties during your stay. We worked very quickly to resolve the issue, though, and our system was back up in less than 24 hours. We truly value your business and hope that you'll give us another try in the future. Thank you for choosing Marriott!
1	Excellent hotel at a great value. This hotel is very clean and comfortable with everything that you need. The beds and pillows were very plush. The shower had nice hot water, but the pressure could have been better (had a downstairs room). Not a bad deal for 62 a night, plus we appreciated that it was pet friendly. The hotel is located in a convenient area (SDSU area) and close to major freeways and trolley stops. The front desk was also very friendly and helpful. We would definitely stay here again and we highly recommend this hotel. We've never been disappointed with Best Western.Dear Jmstone80,I am glad to hear you had a good stay, our philosphy is to offer clean, comfortable rooms, and exceptional service that are still a great value. And it is rewarding to know that we met and exceeded your expectations. If you are ever staying in the San Diego area again, we would be happy to accomodate your family.Thank You,Len Regan-General Manager
1	Conveniently located. We came in a day early for our Alaskan cruise, and we stayed the night at the Four Points by Sheraton. It was very conveniently located for sightseeing as the Space Needle and Chihuly Gardens are only a ten minute walk away. We ate dinner at the restaurant at the hotel, and the food was good. The portions are generous. The waiter was very friendly and told us stories about working as a commercial fisherman in Alaska. Everyone at the hotel is very friendly. We did have one odd experience. They signed us up for a shuttle to take us to the cruise terminal, simply putting us on a list. When the shuttle driver dropped us off at the terminal, he told us we needed to give him a voucher or pay him 7 per person. This was odd since no mention was ever given of the need to have a 7 voucher when we talked to the front desk about the shuttle. I'm not sure what happened there, but since everything else went so well, I'm thinking it must have just been an oversight. I was more than willing to pay for the transportation, but it just felt very awkward. Overall though it was a very good visit. Dear Christine, Thank you so much for your kind review, we really appreciate your comments regarding our convenient location, the Fire Side Cafe restaurant and our friendly staff! I am very sorry for the miscommunication about the shuttle to the terminal. We should have been more efficient at communicating the 7 cost per person for the transportation. We are very happy you had a good visit over all, and hope to see you again the next time you are in Seattle!
1	Top Notch Service and Server!!!!. We stayed three nights at the Springhill Suites Nov 19-22. I was greeted by very courteous staff at check in, a kind gentleman started the lobby fire for us and the facility was clean and most comfortable. The most impressive person there was DeCalvin Wilson. He served each morning at the delicious and varied deluxe continental breakfast and even came and cleared away our dishes in the expansive dining area. This young man went out of his way to care for the customers - I felt I was at the Ritz Carlton (or at least what it would be like if I could afford it). Give DeCalvin a raise and promotion. No he did not solicit such praise - I was just impressed and wrote his name down. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here.
0	No Way. I pulled into Motel Parking Lot that was empty except for homeless guy with his shopping cart. Motel Sign light blinking as if burning out. Broken bed frame tossed away at side of building. Didn't even get out of car, went to Hotel next door. when calling to cancel, was met with questions as to why, owner not very understanding.
1	Holiday Inn Express BWI Airport West. So there is nothing wrong with this hotel. It is average and what you would expect of Holiday Inn Express. I am glad that we got the reservations on Hotels.com. The rooms were conveniently priced and I thought the services of the hotel were fine for the price I had paid. However, when we inquired about staying an extra day the room cost twice as much. I understand that getting reservations early and using a service like hotels.com is much cheaper but I could not see paying twice as much money for such a mediocre hotel.
0	Don't stay here if there is a stadium event.. When there is a Colts game, parking commitments to guests are abandoned in favor of game day parking. The debacle caused us to miss a planned event. Had to check out early because the valets could not promise to bring my car on time, even though I gave them an hour's notice. 25 daily parking fee should ensure better service.
1	Shoreline Hotel Waikiki was perfect for what it was. This hotel was nothing fancy but it was clean and newly renovated. The decor was really funky and tasteful. The room was quite small but we didn't spend much time in it anyway. Bonus: the bed was really comfortable and we got free beach towels everyday. The restaurant next door was really tasty and had nice staff.Aloha Jaime S!Mahalo for taking the time to post such a nice review! Sometimes it's the simple joys of life that set a hotel apart from all the others and that's exactly what we are trying to accomplish here at the Shoreline Hotel Waikiki, a Joie de Vivre hotel. I am so glad that you enjoyed the decor and found the bed to be really comfortable! I hope the next time you visit Waikiki, you will come back to stay with us.Mahalo!Brian AkerDirector of Rooms
0	Gross. We checked in and after trying two rooms we immediately checked right back out and slept in the car. The beds had hair in them and makeup and dirt on the pillow cases and sheets. The first room was a non-smoking room that smelled so badly of cigarettes we couldn't stand it and it also had hair in the bed,... More
0	I was told 'I could have cancelled it, you know' when I arrived here.. I booked a room here through a booking site. Apparently the price they gave was wrong and the manager made sure I understood that he was doing me the biggest favour in the world by letting me pay the quoted price: 'I could have cancelled it, you know', is what he said. He then gave me a room with a broken lock and no key, so every time I had to go out, I had to explain this all over again to whoever was at reception, and who would then go up VERY reluctantly to unlock the door for me. The people next door to me were a bunch of intimidating men watching sports on tv and shouting all night, and wrecking their room (from what I could see from the open door when I walked by there the next morning). Some of the furniture in my room was broken. The breakfast is not worth mentioning (dry bagels, bad coffee). The lady at reception the next morning was much nicer and helpful.
1	Great hip modern hotel in downtown PHX. What a great and unexpected hotel find this was. Found:re had the best combination of a downtown location with cool and interesting decor throughout both the common spaces and guest room. I was there for a quick business trip and the entire staff from valet to front desk to restaurant/bar staff were super friendly and efficient while making sure everything about my stay was excellent. Food in the restaurant was top notch for both dinner and breakfast. The pool was small by Phoenix standards, but perfect for a quick cooling dip after a scorching hot day. Highly recommended place to stay in Phoenix if you are tired of the same old formula chain hotels. Thank you so much. We're happy to hear you had a great stay. Please visit again soon!
1	Wonderful Hotel in San Fran. I was traveling solo and had a wonderful experience at the Orchard Garden. As others have stated, the property is new, very clean, and has a calm and serene atmosphere. The roof garden is wonderful on a clear day and the overall emphasis on the environment throughout the hotel is very inspiring. The location is perfect - you can walk to Union Square, the Ferry Market and other key locations - and the trolley/cable cars and the Muni are very close to the hotel so transportation options are plentiful. My hotel rate did not include the complementary breakfast and so I had an excellent breakfast each morning across the street at a nice French cafe - less money than I would have paid at the OGH.As far as I am concerned, there are not enough properties like this anymore in the heart of our great urban areas. The OGH is a gem! Try it when you go to SF! PS - I requested car service to SFO on my last morning. The driver was on time and the rate was exactly what I was quoted the day before.
1	Great location to San Diego sites.. This hotel is centrally located close to the many attractions that San Diego has to offer. The staff was very friendly and efficient. I was traveling with a group of just over 20 people and upon our arrival they had all our rooms ready for check in. But, not only that, they also had all our keys labeled with our names and room numbers already on them. That made for such a smooth registration and check in (as well as check out). Our stay was for 4 days and 3 nights. Another convenience the hotel provided was a shuttle ride to and from the SD Zoo. Eliminating the chore of fighting through traffic, driving (in an unfamiliar area), and parking. The rooms were well maintained, clean and had small refrigerators in each room. The hotel also has a pool (which we didn't have time to use) and a restaurant serving home cooked meals on site. I also liked that it was quiet.Dear MariaLC60: Thank you for your nice remarks in regard to your recent stay. It is certainly appreciated! We are so glad that you enjoyed our friendly and efficient Staff, as well as our complimentary shuttle service that offers transportation to many local area attractions. It is a delight knowing you also appreciated our well maintained guestrooms, quiet property, and the convenience of a pool. Perhaps, you will have the chance to utilize it on your next visit. We are happy that you loved our onsite restaurant, Seven Seas Caf, serving breakfast, lunch and dinner from 6am-10pm for our guests convenience. Thank you for choosing the Best Western Seven Seas in San Diego for your hotel accommodations and for being our guest! Most Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff
1	Loved this hotel!! Just wonderful!. This hotel was everything we wanted it to be, and the price reflected that. We paid 448 per night for our room, which I have never done before-HOWEVER this was my sister's birthday treat and we wanted to do it right. Plus it included breakfast for 4, so you can take about 60 bucks off right there. I felt welcomed and like the staff truly enjoyed having us there. What a nice place, even for one night. Not sure if they can do anything about this, but there are a lot of vagrants/homeless that camp out right on the grass in front of the pool. Just was a little awkward, but it might not be the hotel's property.We are so glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us, happy birthday to your sister! We hope to welcome you back again soon.
0	Absolutely Horrible. This is the motel that began my boycott of all Motel 6's. Two obviously drunk people asked me for a ride and I said no, so they got belligerent. I made my way to the office to report them and they followed me. They waited for me for over half an hour outside the office, yelling profanities and threatening to... More

1	nothing special but great just to rest your head!. if your wanting to spend alot of time at your hotal DONOT go here but if you want somewhere cheap, comforty + friendly to rest your head after long days at the parks id recommended it. Have to admit when first arrived i was gutted, but after a couple days realised this was just what we needed. theres a basic breakfast you can help yourself to in morning, free shuttles to all the big parks, i-trolley stop just outside on main road, heated swimming pool, internet + room was quite big apart from bathroom which was small + had a few cracks + dents here + there. Main road behind hotel which thought was going to be a issue coz fairly loud but after spending days in the parks, i can honestly say i had 14 very good night sleeps. would stay there again but as i say it is a budget hotel, just a bed to rest your bed if you are after more form your hotel don't go here.
0	Missed Opportunity. Beautiful hotel. Great location. Rooms are comfortable and relatively clean. Service is marginal at best. Front desk is nothing but warm body zombies. Night Auditor Jen is a nightmare!!! She obviously hates people and hates her job. Just too bad she takes it out on the guests instead of getting therapy.I am sorry that your stay was not all that it could have been. Please be assured that I will address your issues with my staff. We hope you give us another try when you are back in the area.Melissa AlbertGeneral Manager
1	The bomb!. From now on this is my go-to place in Atlanta. I have stayed at various hotels on the northside of Atlanta. No more. I am staying at the Renassiance Waverly exclusively from now on. Although they were undergoing rennovation on three florrs, they did everything to accomodate me during my stay. Great room, great breakfast and great service. It's the bomb!This review really put a smile of my face! Thank you so much for the kind comments, we are thrilled to be your hotel of choice! I am also very pleased the renovation was not disruptive to you, we will be done at the end of March and will then have all new guest rooms! We hope to see you back with us very soon.
0	Broken down in Mechanicsburg. My wife and I were both traveling in PA and I was able to glom on to her reservation on my way to Williamsport the following day. She used mobile check in and I beat her there. The desk clerk was great and Fter checking my ID, gave me the keys. I asked if it was a quiet room away... More
1	A piece of the roaring 20's. We loved our stay at the hotel. The interior design is just fantastic. Art Deco revival lives in that hotel. The best part was the evening cocktail party for the entire hotel. Every evening everyone is invited to the lobby for a complimentary drink of prosecco. Not my favourite drink but fun. You do have the feeling that it was from a different age. PThe rooms were well done and quiet. Friendly staff although I got the wrong directions to the subway to Ohare when I was checking out and one of the bartenders does not know anything about wine, which is odd given how much they are charging for it. Fairly minor issues. The wifi was really hard to use at first. They say it's free and it is but they want you to fill out this form on-line asking way to many questions and very personal at that. I refused and called their support line and the guy was very helpful and gave me an access code that was not given to me at checkin in. I was very annoyed that they were trying to mine data from me that way. I have not seen a hotel do that before and I thought it was sneaky and inappropriate. I thought the cost was very reasonable and the location is great, easy access to the downtown and a good distance to the west loop which now seems to have the best restaurants and a very vibrant atmosphere. I would go back for sure.
1	Great place to stay if you want to go to DC. The room was good and on the opposite side of the highway and low (2nd floor) as we heard others say something about the highway noise. The breakfast and shuttle saved us a ton of money and time. The hot breakfast (eggs, waffles, grits, oatmeal, etc.) is the same everyday but there is enough of a variety if you stay long it won't get boring. The shuttle will take you within 3 miles and the DC Metro station is within this range. They start at 6:30 am if you wan to get an early start but they had 3 different vans so we had no wait anytime we wanted to leave. Short wait when you called for pick-up but not long. No parking hassles in DC (15+ a day or at the Metro station (5 a day). It was hot (100+) so the pool was a great way to cool off after walking all day around DC.
0	Beware. This motel is a place where Michigan uses for hathway house for Sexual Predators. They have ankle bracelets on. These guys are supposed to be around kids. I stayed there and was pestered by these folks. I could not even be in the room without them waiting for me to come out. Also the cleaning standards weren't very good. You... More
1	Wonderful hotel!. The best thing about The River Hotel is the staff! They make you feel extremely welcome and that they cannot do enough to accommodate you. I was particularly impressed with Pedro on the front desk, who was cheerful and obliging, and a great ambassador for the hotel. The location is perfect, and the rooms both comfortable and private. Great value for money. I thoroughly recommend the hotel to anyone visiting Chicago.Dear azelinaf2017,Thank you for giving us a perfect rating and for recommending our hotel to other travelers. I'm sure our entire hotel staff enjoyed catering to your needs as much as you enjoyed your stay. Pedro is great and a big part of our team and I will be sure he sees your kind words. Thank you for taking the time to recognize him as you have.Please come see us again!
0	All ok until tablet was stolen. We booked the hotel for a two night stay. When we entered the hotel room, we were satisfied with space. We were surprised no extra blankets and pillows were in the room for pull out sofa bed. Front desk was polite and provides them, upon request. Breakfast was mediocre, at best. A/C in room was ok. Constantly humid in the... More
1	Quiet location, good value. This was a business trip and I found the hotel occupied by business people as well as families. Staff was very friendly and accommodating, on all shifts. Bed was comfortable. My room was taken care of nicely except for one day when the bed was not made (I didn't mention it to the desk clerk). Breakfast was set up late every day (after 7 a.m. although the sign says 7:00 and I was told it is actually 6 to 6:30 and all the hot items required microwaving, so early birds can't really eat and run. It was impossible to control the heat, cool and humidity in the room but I understand a renovation is scheduled so I imagine that will correct that situation. Price was right. Overall, I would stay in this property again.

1	Helped to arrange and attended a relexology conference at the hotel. Excellent experience with all staff we were involved with. I am in love with the Allegro! Had not been a fan of Art Deco until my visit at the Allegro. Beautiful everywhere I went! The bed was very comfortable, clean room.Hi Connie! Thank you for taking the time to write this review! We are so pleased to see you enjoyed your time with us during the Reflexology conference. It was a pleasure to host your group and we hope you to welcome you back for any future trips to Chicago!
0	Bad. Just not satisfied with the outdated room that had a bad odor, stained mattresses, stained carpet and no hot water in the sink due to faucet being broken. The front desk staff was very pleasant and breakfast was good but that won't bring me back for another stay.
1	The staff makes it. Between the front desk (too many greats to name) to Hussain and Israel (tenth floor butlers), to the great staff at King Cole's, this is an excellent property. I have stayed in the Four Seasons, Ritz, and elsewhere, and found this to be a great place. Highly appreciated. Room was great, but as is clear from the hotel business, property is secondary to service.Service rules, and the St Regis staff is excellent. Kudos to Krista the concierge (not to miss the stars). I recommend this hotel. Expensive, yes, but value received.Dear rowingman,Thank you so much for sharing your kind words about our staff. Our team makes it our mission to provide genuine service to each and every guest and we are so pleased that you experienced this firsthand. We will share your feedback with Hassan, Israel, Krista, and the team! We hope to see you again soon at The St. Regis New York.Kindly,Hermann W. ElgerGeneral Manager
1	Great Place to Stay. Very nice staff! We used our Best Western Rewards points to obtain a free night's stay. They upgraded us to a two story suite! Very special. Room was spotless and everything was in perfect working order. The entire facility is well maintained and safe. While we were on a busy highway through town, there was no noise in our room. A substantial breakfast is provided at the Denny's adjacent to the hotel. Across the street is ample shopping, and there is a Starbucks nearby. We will stay here again.We are glad you enjoyed your stay and we were able to upgrade you to the suite. The perks of being a BW Rewards member.
0	St. James Hotel, New Orleans- Jennifer Dragna GM. This place needs new management!! Jennifer the GM is about as useless as tits on a bull. Staff assured us on Monday that there were plenty rooms available!! Her staff (Christy, asst. GM)assured us on Tuesday and Wednesday that they would honor a gift certificate for one nights stay this weekend and Christy would call us back on Thursday with a confirmation because she didnt know how to enter the gift certificate into the computer. No phone call was received on Thursday so we call today. After 3 phone calls, we finally speak to the GM -Jennifer, who said they could not honor the gift certificate bc no rooms were available! This is a BOLD FACED LIE!! There are rooms available according to their website! Do not do business with this joke of a hotel! Customer service is terrible!! The staff is uneducated and clearly lacks customer service knowledge.Dear palmers1800,As I have mentioned on the many other reviews that you have written, I do apologize that we were not able to accommodate your gift certificate this past weekend. Gift certificates are donated as a courtesy to many charitable events that are important to the St. James Hotel family. On the gift certificates, we do specify that they can not be used over special event periods and are for standard rooms. Unfortunately, this past weekend was a special event and we only had 1 room available at the time we spoke which was our King Suite. I do require all gift certificates to be approved through me so I sincerely apologize if you received the incorrect information through our front desk staff. Christie, Assistant GM, began her career at the St. James only a few weeks ago and was not yet familiar with our policies and procedures regarding gift certificates. We would be more than happy to accommodate you in future. Please reach out to me directly at the below direct line. I do hope to hear from you so that we are able to show you the level of customer service that I know the St. James staff is capable or providing. Again, I apologize for any miscommunication and I look forward to hearing from you. Best, Jennifer DragnaGeneral Manager(504)962-0781
0	Won't be back. I almost always stay at Super8s when I travel. This was my first time at this property and it was the least desirable of any I have stayed at. The only room available when I made the reservation was an accessible one. That's fine, I have used those before. The handheld shower head in this one would not stay straight.... More
1	Great Value Prime Location. We checked in this Inn for a weekend stay. We are very satisfied. I was worry at the beginning but after we stayed for a night, I was happy to say I was worry free. This is in the center of Chinatown, which is a prime location of San Francisco. Its very easy to access to banks, restaurants, Walgreens. Furniture are not new, there is no flat screen TV. But we were outside most of the time so its ok. We can walk from here to Fisherman Wharf (around 30 mins). The bonus is, parking is free. So we saved for parking.
1	gem of a hotel. This is a great hotel for everyone. It seems very secluded but is only a few miles from La Jolla and easy access to the freeway. You could drive by the property and never see it.There are alot of trees/flowers/etc for a homey feeling.The spa and pool area are lovely as are the grounds.Alot of the rooms have balconies or patio's. The Adobe restaurant does a great breakfast. Buffet or ala carte.Mustangs and Burros has a great feel with an outdoor fireplace and music nightly. Their specialty is margarita's. Scented candles are all over the property and lit at night for a romantic feel. The hotel has alot of meeting space and is only 3 stories high.suite 124 is really nice if you want a nice place to relax. It is very large. The 'regular' rooms are a nice size also. The staff is great and very accomodating.
0	Bourbon Street delight or horror. Right on Bourbon Street tjis can be a great place or a nightmare. The street is loud, so sleeling is difficult. They do supply ear plugs.Very nice and pleasant staff.The air conditioners do not eork well.Dear tomrzaca,Thank you for the great comments about our pleasant team. We are sorry your stay was interrupted by maintenance issues with your air conditioner. We have taken this up with our maintenance team and we are working on the problem. We appreciate you letting us know and we hope you will choose us again in the future for an improved experience.Beth AblesGeneral Manager
1	Beautiful hotel and convenient location. Stayed here for two nights while visiting New Orleans for the first time. Walking distance to historical and party districts or catch a trolley car to the river for 1.25. Room was clean and nicely decorated - but you probably won't spend much time there. The hotel is a gorgeous, renovated old building. Wish I would have looked up the history of it while we were there. Located on a busy road but on the 4th floor we didn't hear the noise of the city. Stayed on south side - view is similar on all sides.Parking was 25/night.Traveled with adult child and we would stay there again!
0	Management ripped us off. When my friends and I looked for overnight stays in New Orleans during this years's Jazz festival we were in desperate need for accomodation as we decided to go on the trip last minute. When we explained the management that we needed to stay on a budget as low as possible, preferring to share one room instead of booking two, they deliberately misunderstood us, charging us the room rate for two instead of one. We immediatly realized the mistake and asked to rectify it. The management was then totally unhelpful, refused to rectify and called the police. The police sided with the management, which should not even have been an issue at all right from the start. Any serious and well-led hotel should allow the customers to rectify a booking, particularly since we hadn't even entered the rooms. Do not stay there if you are looking for an honest management and good service!!
1	Awesome!!! Highly recommend!!!. Great place to stay in the keys at an affordable price without sacrificing quality. Location: not on the beach but within driving/ biking distance to downtown and quiet. On site is a biking company to rent bikes or scooters from definitely recommend. Their kiosk is located next to the pool bar.Room: clean room, clean bedding/sheets, bed was medium comfort but we slept fine Pool: beautiful and big it wasn't crowded at all so you could enjoy it an any time. Lounge chairs were comfortable and cabanas were nice on a first come first serve basis. The pool bar was very nice with a variety of drinks. I wouldn't recommend the pool food with the exception of the wings and fries which were really good. Try some of the local beers on tap my favorite was the Crazy Lady very smooth. Free Breakfast: continental breakfast with a variety of fruits, waffles, eggs, bagels, cereal, and coffee etcOverall : Had a very relaxing and fun two day stay here. I highly recommend it to anyone going down to the keys. I definitely plan to be back here on my next trip down. Dear Susana L,Thank you for taking the time to Review our Hotel. We are very Happy that you had a Nice Stay and enjoyed our Breakfast and Pool. We hope to see you back in Key West very soon for another Nice stay with us.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager
0	Angry cancelled stay. We had booked this hotel for two nights after our cruise in January . Two months before we were to arrive our plane home was moved to an exceptionally early time. We decided we had to stay at an airport hotel in order to make our plane, since we had to be at the airport by 4:30AM. I called to cancel the one night. Imagine my surprise when Hyatt raised the room rate for the remaining night 165. I questioned the reasoning and was told that even though we had until 24 hours before to cancel they treated the remaining night as a new reservation. We found a different hotel a block away and cancelled this entire reservation. Beware!
1	Mike Ron. We were invited to a wedding at the Wanamaker Crystal tea room. So we decided to stay at Lowe's on market Street because it was so close to the venue. From the moment we pulled the car into the valet parking the help and staff were more than exemplary. Check-in was a breeze they were more than helpful and we were in our room within five minutes. Our room was very contemporary and decorated nicely. It was also very nice to see people staying with their pets, I didn't know that it was a pet friendly hotel. next visit I certainly will bring my dog.There was a threat of rain and quite a few of the employees informed us that we could get umbrellas at the valet desk that they would loan you very nice touch. I would highly recommend this hotel.We are glad you enjoyed your recent stay and that you enjoyed ease and comfort from start to finish. We are a pet friendly hotel and would love to host you and your dog during a return visit. We look forward to your future stay.Ryan F.
1	Love the breakfast. Clean rooms comfortable beds (except that with all the pillows it would be nice to have some less-full ones) pool hot-tub, cable tv room service hair dryer iron board and a delicious full breakfast all for a very decent affordable price.

0	struck out at Ramada. I have stayed at many Ramada's over the years. This location was very run down. Carpet was soiled and dated. Had to call front desk for a TV remote and then get it ourselves. Continental breakfast was sadly lacking. Even the batter for the Waffles seemed watered down.
0	OK for one night. Old run down furniture, room needed to be repainted, peeling paint, curtains ripped and dirty, carpet ok, but room was not as clean as it should be. Only good items in room was bed, tv, refrigerator, microwave, balcony room, shower head. Bathroom wasn't properly cleaned and definitely needs to be spruced up. Facility itself is nice with attractive lobby, pool, convenient.
1	Spacious and close to Mickey. The exterior could use some updating. However, the interior is very spacious for our large family. The resort is very close to Disney parks Downtown Disney. You have access to JW Marriott amenities at no extra cost. There is a complimentary shuttle that will take you there and back. Our kids loved the pool and slides at the JW. There are activities planned if you want to spend time on the property. The only things I was not happy with is there are no utensils in the grill areas, pools close rather early and the motor went bad in our refrigerator around 9:30pm one evening. It was not fixed until the next morning, so the noise overnight and early wake up by the repairman was less than pleasant.
1	Perfect holiday hotel. We thoroughly enjoyed staying at this hotel. We travelled with our kids aged 4 and 6. The rooms were clean, spacious and well maintained. The beds were great and all of us slept well. The hotel provided vouchers towards breakfast at the adjoining restaurant. The restaurant was great and we used the vouchers towards whatever breakfast we ordered. The hotel had amazing grounds with a putting golf course that was fun for everyone. The pool was fantastic and we lucked out with great weather. We spent many hours in the pool, lounging, playing shuffleboard and snacking from the attached bar. The happy hour was a great perk.
0	Filthy hotel and crooked people who own it!. We had no choice but to stay here when a tornado hit the area and most of Vineland was without power. They charged us 190 for one night, wouldn't accept my AAA card and after leaving, we found out, we had been charged for 4 cats (which we don't own) and for another person. It was only my husband and... More
1	Great location workout room. We had a lovely Christmas staycation at the Grand Hyatt Seattle (seriously, we took the bus from our home in Redmond to get here).We were greeted with a hot chocolate and christmas cookie bar... as well as an upgrade to a water view room!The hotel is within walking distance to all of the main downtown sites. We ordered room service for breakfast and were happy with our waffles. There is a Starbucks right downstairs, so we got coffee from there and brought it back up for a Christmas Eve treat.The workout room was really high end and clean. There was also a sauna and hot tub - I wish I brought my swimsuit!The Grand Hyatt made our staycation overnight stay very special.

1	They nailed the basics but the staff made the difference.. Stayed for 3 nights and was very happy with the accommodation and service provided.Yes, there were renovations going on but we did not hear any noise or was inconvenienced at all. The workers took the rear service elevator (2R or 1R) and other than the faint smell of paint while passing the rooms being renovated, we hardly noticed any construction going on. All the information and amenities provided in the hotel website were accurate- great to do research ahead of time and know what is expected. The basics were all there: Clean hotel, professional staff, good communication and thoughtfulness (front desk remembered/addressed me by name during conversations from day 1-3).Pros: 1.Staff Hospitality and Friendliness- The staff that we met were all delightful and friendly. They engaged us in conversation and made us feel welcomed. Front desk Eimy and the night front desk person (Paul) was accommodating and helpful, so as the sous chef, housekeeping and restaurant staff, The genuine energy and hospitality from the staff was evident. Their courtesy and friendliness made us feel welcomed. We were consistently greeted with a hello and eye contact- the housekeeping staff, restaurant servers, front desk, facilities or construction workers that we meet in the lobby, hall way, elevator or restaurant, This may be basic service but truly made a difference during our stay,2. The shuttle service was excellent. Quick and friendly drivers (Terrance and Andreas). I called the front desk for a pick up and it took about 10 minutes for the driver to arrive at A 44 (the pick up location). After a red eye flight, this could not be any better.Throughout our stay, we used the shuttle to take us to the restaurants nearby, to an event location and of course to the airport. The shuttle service was a big bonus in this hotel. 3. Lobby- Clean, new furniture and nice modern decor. Very welcoming and comfortable.4. Rooms- Spacious, A/C worked well, nice comfortable bed, microwave, refrigerator and well appointed rooms (booked 2 rooms). The bathroom was quite small but clean. The bedroom and living rooms are separated. Requested a roll away bed (10) and it fit perfectly fine in the living room with the sofa bed, desk,and a chair, This hotel is a category 2 and going through renovation. It was clean, comfortable and functional. Areas of Opportunity:1. Breakfast menu selection- The food selection was quite limited, It is the usual fare (french toast, bread, bagel, eggs, sausage and bacon with fruit, oatmeal and cereal). Would be nice to have an omelet station. They do cook eggs to order and had scrambled egg whites with spinach on one of the days, Service was fast and friendly (provided beverages). The fresh fruit was not so fresh as it tasted sour and looked mushy. The server was informed and he took action immediately,Some tips:1.Hotel shuttle is available within 2 mile radius and covers about 25 restaurants -from fine dining to fast food, a mini-mart, and a souvenir gift shop. 2. The gas station closest to the hotel charges twice as much. If you need to fill the rental car before heading to the airport, the gas prices at the 7-Eleven is much cheaper.3. Super Wal-mart is about 7 minutes away and has every thing-food, clothes, souvenirs, pharmacy, party supplies, etc.. However, the hotel shuttle does not go there and have to use a private transport company or taxi, (costed us 24 round trip). 4. Transport to Downtown Disney or Epcot is 100 Round Trip. Van can accommodate 9 people. Just let the front desk know 30 minutes to 1 hour before to schedule pick up.
1	Great staff. My husband and I stayed here while we looked for apartments and toured Full Sail University. Everyone was really helpful and super nice. Todd and Mrs Dena had us laughing the whole trip, we could have spent the trip just laughing with them. Brandon was great and really made us feel welcome and happy. The breakfast was alright, nothing spectacular but something for everyone. The only thing bad I can say is that it seems like maintenance sometimes forgets that guests can hear them on the radio, just a little a sassy but not rude at all. All in all our trip proved one thing, wish we could move in to the best western. Also a really big thing for my husband and I, no one batted am eye lash about two men sharing a king size bed. Love this place would come back and will tell all our family and friends to stay here. I appreciate you taking the time to reply to this survey. I apologize that breakfast was not to your liking, however, we have improved our breakfast menu. We now offer bacon, sausage, egg omelet, scrambled eggs and much more. It's nice to know we were able to make you smile and that your stay was enjoyable. Hope to see again soon.
0	Affordable. It was kind of creepy that people lived there and would zoom into the parking lot with their lights off. The morning we checked out, the renters must have had to clean the room. They came hauling bedding and a vacuum with only jeans on, sweating profusely. Their coffee in the lobby was watered down, and a continental breakfast was... More
1	Best birthday. My husband and I decided to head South to spend our April 2018 birthdays in New Orleans. Our stay at the Troubadour was perfect. The entire staff (especially Jalen at the front desk and bellman) made our trip memorable and worth a return stay. This will be our home away from home whenever we're visiting New Orleans. Oh, and the buffet was simply marvelous!Thank you very much for choosing The Troubadour to celebrate your birthdays with us and we are delighted to know you had such a great time. We will be sure to share this among our team so they know their efforts did not go unnoticed and we do hope to have you back for another visit real soon.Best regards,
1	Thank you for a great stay!. Hello. I stood at this woodspring suites for two weeks. While I was there and I had a great stay. When I walked in the the lobby to check in the manager and the general manager greeted me with kindness and it felt really good. When I got to my room, the room felt very clean. I stood at this hotel due to work. I will be returning shortly and I will also tell my other co-workers to stay there. Thank you for a great stay.We are so glad our staff was able to make your time at WoodSpring Suites a great one. The WoodSpring Suites team strives to make your stay one you wont forget. Thank you for sharing your experience with us and we hope we get the privilege to serve you again soon.
0	Poor service and stolen funds. Double charged my credit card and then refused to assist. Room was only so so and did not fix broken fridge and bathtub or offer to move our room. Would never stay here again.
1	Broken Air Conditioner. I havw stayed at this hotel several times and the staff is pleasant and the rooms are clean. However, every time I stay there is usually a proble with the air conditioner or the heater. Each time maintenance has to fix it. I don't understand why the first nigjt I have to sleep sweating or cold because the air or heat is not working properly. I think the hotel must control the utilities from a central unit and they do not adjust the temperature for you until you complain. Otherwise, the hotel is lovely. Expect to pay a whopping 32 per night for parking. Unbelievable!

0	Bad experience, haven't even stayed there yet!. We booked this hotel months in advance for our upcoming Disneyland vacation carefully taking into consideration all our options of the many comparable hotels in Anaheim. Less than two weeks before our arrival date an email notification came to advise us the pool would be closed for maintenance for the majority of our stay! Now I am aware that this is necessary, however in all of my past experiences any type of scheduled maintenance is clearly disclosed well in advance. Upon a call to the hotel's manager to discuss this concern, no apology or compensation was offered, and she even encouraged us to look into other hotel options! With less than two weeks to go entering a busy season, clearly most hotels are already booked. Very unprofessional and disappointing is my option of this hotel already, and we've not even set foot on the property!

1	We Love Drury Inn at New Orleans..... Beautiful Hotel situated in a great location. Only 10 minute walk to Bourbon Street or tram right outside the door.Staff were all very courteous and helpful. Room was absolutely beautiful. King Size Bed in a huge room, big bathroom. Rooms were immaculate and very, very comfortable.Drury Inn serve free drinks and nibblies late afternoon. We enjoyed this at the end of our day.Our highlight of New Orleans was doing the Katrina Bus Tour. It was 3 hours very well spent and would recommend this to anyone visiting as staying in Downtown you wouldn't realise that anything had happened.

0	Will Never Go Back. I recently stayed at the Francisco Bay Inn during a conference in San Francisco, and based upon my last minute booking, was left with few viable lodging choices at a reasonable rate. This hotel is unclean, my room, and the room of my traveling colleague, had a funky unpleasant odor that required the AC to (partially) clear out. The bathroom had cracked floor tiles, peeling wallpaper, stains on the walls, and the decor is overall is extremely outdated.The glass door of the office/reception area has been smashed, and the outlet in my bathroom burned out and destroyed my relatively new Braun electric razor. The manager let me know they tested the electrical outlets, and since voltage was apparently normal, they wouldn't do anything about my razor.The location is convenient, and the woman who checked us into our rooms was nice. Otherwise, an overpriced, terrible place to stay. The Buena Vista a block down the street is a better choice for the same general rate.
0	Non recommanded stay. Nice locationGood staff Th rooms need to be Aired and to ne cleaned.Th breakfast is a shameTh location is goodWe dont recommanded this hotel as for th quality or th rooms as for the quality of th breakfast server into plastic platesDear Guest,Thank you very much for visiting our hotel and for sharing the details of your stay.

I have shared your review with my colleagues so we can address these concerns for our future guests. Because of honest feedback we are able to constantly improve ourselves among the marketplace.
0	Good hotel except for the internet. Hotel is clean and well kept. Rooms are usual Microtel fare. Water pressure on second floor left something to be desired. Beds are very firm. Biggest issue was internet begin almost unusable after 5 PM. Once more than a handful of people log on, you're plagued with frequent drops and buffering. Really holds back a good hotel.
0	Not the greatest. I checked in to the hotel greeted with a smile, which was good. Mind you the concierge was a little chatty. But that may just be me since I was exhausted coming in. When I went in to the room, it was stuffy even with the AC on. Which was really, really loud. I could not sleep. And if I turn down the AC, it was too hot. Opening the window, there was too much noise from the traffic outside. It was close to the highway and it was impossible to drive out of the lot without having to make a U-turn somewhere first. The bathroom was moldy. The breakfast was bad. The coffee was horrible. All in all, I had to check out after 1 night of my 5 night stay and checked in at a different hotel altogether. I was not happy.
0	Gangbanger Central on Saturday night. Booked one night on priceline since my usual hotels were full and didn't feel like using Hilton points. Will never make that mistake again. Pulled into hotel lot on a Saturday night about 10:00 p.m. Lot was COMPLETELY full even at that fairly early hour, lot spaces are very inadequate to the number of rooms. Finally managed to find a place after circling four times. Just as I was only pulling my bags out, three cars in the lot, all vehicles carrying gangbanger types drove by (looking to park at the hotel, not leaving), looking at me and scoping out my car. Similar type patrons in the lobby and around the exterior corridors of the hotel. I am not shy about travel, I have walked and worked in rough downtown areas, but I do expect to feel at least a modicum of safety for my person and belongings/vehicle. As I was walking to the lobby, two police cruisers came into the lot, one to circle, the other to park for awhile. At that point, I had it -- I informed the management that I would rather waste my priceline bid and go stay somewhere else, which I did. I am very disappointed that a Best Western would allow this activity on its property. The police did not seem to act like this was an isolated incident, but rather one of their regular patrols. I do not leave a negative review unless I feel it really warrants it, and this one wins first prize for me. I will never book this property again, let alone stay here. It is unsafe-feeling, and I would never take a family here.On behalf of myself and the entire staff here at the Best Western Inn Miramar, we are saddened to hear that a guest was displeased with his recent experience at the hotel. We pride ourselves on excellent guest service, beautiful and comfortable accommodations, and a safe and pleasant experience. The location of this hotel is in close proximity to the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar and is a very safe location. One of our most respected accounts is one that is with a Marine Division on this base. During the evening this guest checked in with us we had a large group of this Marine Division staying with us. We feel privileged to have the Marine Division stay at the Best Western Inn Miramar. They are the very men and women who protect our country and we are honored to have them at the hotel. They are often times not in military uniform during their stay at the hotel but are by no means gangbangers. They are polite, quiet, and very respectable guests. We have a very close relationship with their command and have never had any problems with them in the many years they have used us as their preferred hotel. To ensure the safety of all of our guests we have area officers occasionally do courtesy visits to the hotel as they do other hotels in the surrounding area. The Best Western Inn Miramar is in a very safe area and is located in a county with a dedicated and very courteous police force. There was no activity going on at the hotel and we thank the police for being kind enough to check up on us once in awhile, stop in for a cup of coffee and say hello. We appreciate their service.We are sorry that the guests experienced anything but absolute satisfaction during his visit as it is our goal to provide nothing but the best for each and every one of our guests whether they are business men, military soldiers, sports teams, or family vacationers. Each and every guest is important to us!Manu PatelGeneral Manager
0	Black Mold in bathroom. For a place just to sleep it may be ok. But there was mold in the bathroom. It is very close to the highway but very ran down part of town. There are signs that encourage customers to lock and chain their doors but there were no chains in the two rooms we were in. Breakfast is cereal and muffins.... More
0	C O Bike Trip from Paw Paw to Shepherdstown. There are so many mixed reviews for this Inn. Perhaps we should post the room number when we write the reviews. I was in Room 102 with two beds. The sheets had old stains on them. There was a very musty odor to the room that was only made worse when the air conditioning was turned on. The door closed... More
0	Disappointing stay for a Marriott Residence Inn. We spent two nights here for our son's graduation from Georgia Tech. The room seemed typical for a RI, but they only have queen beds (ours was uncomfortable in addition). We leaded out early on the day of his graduation and returned after 10PM. Imagine our disgruntlement to find that the room had not been serviced and that the only towels in the room were the wet ones we left in the tub to indicate to housekeeping that we wanted fresh ones for the second night. The Courtyard Atlanta Midtown/Georgia Tech had always been our lodging of choice prior to this experience and we have never had any complaints while here. Probably better to not reiterate our mistake.
1	Staff made our anniversary!. We were taken aback by the staff, especially Jalan who since we walked in took care of us. We felt like royalty! They secured a bottled of champagne and treats for our 22nd wedding anniversary ... so very kind! The hotel is lovely, a boutique stay with a Hilton flair. Its modern but not over the top. Very clean and very comfortable with a great rooftop bar. It is not in the French Quarter so beware we actually liked that as we know NOLA well. Surely a destination to be considered. Thank you for taking the time to write this wonderful review of your anniversary celebration at our hotel. We love to hear back when we not only meet but exceed expectations. Jalan is certainly a rising star on our staff and has been commended for his efforts in taking great care of you. It was our pleasure to have you as our guest and hope to have you back for another visit very soon.Sincerely,
1	Great location in historic district. I have stayed at this hotel several times. It has a great location 1/12 blocks from Broad Street. The public area are very nice, and the staff is helpful and friendly. The rooms are nicely sized and well furnished. My only complaint is that the walls provide very little barrier to sound. We could easily hear the people in the adjoining room and the hallway. With a number of weddings going on the sound level was probably more than typical, however, be aware that your room could be noisy depending on who you are adjacent to.
0	DISAPPOINTING don't stay here. It was awful We went for one night as we were grieving and needed to get away First of all the 35 parking fee was ridiculous and your parking attendant sneered at us and said This IS La Jolla. Wow. When I asked the front desk what was the deal with the parking it was just uh yeah sorry. The room 808 was just OK. Altjough we were kept awake by some shenanigans going on in The room above us ALL NIGHT We will not be returning and regret we booked this room in our grief. It did nothing to help.
0	Just say NO. We stayed the night at this hotel the night before our family reunion. I made reservations, so I take the blame for this. The room was exactly what it looks like on the pictures. It was clean. There was a smell in the room that I still cannot determine. There were many people in the parking lot. It looked as... More
1	Excellent service near chinatown. Good, clean rooms. Small-medium sized but the room amenities were complete and nothing to complain about.Excellent service and very friendly/accomodating staff.Environment-friendly. We like that they commit to plant trees for every trip advisor review.Thank you so much for the kind review and for commending us on our eco-conscious efforts. We opened in 2006 as a LEED (Leadership in Energy Environmental Design) certified Hotel and since then we have been thinking of ways to be even greener. With suggestions from staff and guests, we have made a number of changes that will reflect in the next LEED certification renewal. I do not want to spoil the big news to come, but we are very excited. We are also thrilled to be affiliated with a campaign such as Plant a Billion Tees. With the help of our guests we have planted 200 trees this last quarter in an effort to restore the Atlantic Rain Forrest, which is only 12 percent of its original size. Trees store an enormous amount of carbon dioxide and in return releases oxygen, something we think is valuable, especially in the travel industry.Thanks again for choosing to stay with us and we hope to see you again soon.Kind regardsQuinn McEnteeFront Office Manager
1	Good Location. Stayed here for 3 nights whilst visiting San Francisco . Great location everything within walking distance. Rooms lovely they have just been re furbished with everything you need coffee facilities/iron/hairdryer etc . Continental breakfast available in reception which you can take back to your room.Free parking but spaces are limited. Reasonably priced for San Francisco would recommend.Hi Kevin, Our location is definitely one of the fantastic things about our hotel. We are so lucky to have a property in the heart of San Francisco, and which is so convenient for so many of the city's attractions. We are delighted that our hotel seems to have been so suitable for your needs, and we hope that you will stay with us again when you are next in town. Best wishes, Hotel Management
1	The Perfect NY Hotel. From the moment we checked in to our last minute there, the service was world class. The hotel itself is located around the corner from 5th avenue with all the great shopping your wife could possibly want. Our room was ornate and luxurious. What you would expect from a St. Regis. The butler service was top notch and at our beck and call for a cup of tea or whatever we needed. Our first night we had difficulty getting a taxi to our restaurant, so the hotel have is a free ride in their own Bentley. They will do that if the location is not too far. The concierge made our dinner reservations for us in advance. Near the end of our meal, the waiter came back to our table with the manager and said your concierge asked us to provide with our house specialty (desert), which the hotel paid for. This hotel is the standard for great customer service. This is officially our hotel for NY. What a wonderful 5 star experience!Dear Dan B,We were delighted to have you stay with us at The St. Regis New York and are thrilled to hear that you had an enjoyable experience.Thank you for your time and for recognizing our mission to provide the best service and pampering experience to each of our guests. We will share your kind words with our staff, and we are so grateful for your support!We look forward to welcoming you back to New York soon! Kindly, Maria Wittorp-DejongeChef Concierge
0	Hotel is getting worn and has poor customer service with attitude. I recently stayed at this property as it was listed as a three-diamond under AAA ratings and had bunk beds for my two young children. This hotel is not as nice as advertised. The room I had showed its age as it was looking dirty and worn. I also had one of the worst experiences I have ever had with the hotel personnel and management. Their customer service was very poor. On the second night of our stay the Toilet backed up a around 8:30 P.M. I called the front desk and was told there was no one who could fix it so I could move to another room. I declined this, as it would have taken at least an hour and a half to pack up, move, unpack and set up the room. My children were just going to bed so moving and doing the work would have been quite intrusive. I couldnt believe that they didnt have anyone who could plunge the toiled as this hotel has over 125 rooms. I asked if they had a plunger and the desk person stated he would look. He later called and stated that he couldnt find one. (really) I could use the bathroom six rooms down for the night. I advised that this was unacceptable, as it would be disruptive as the kids would probable get up a couple of times. He stated that no one else was there and the manager didnt answer the phone and he couldnt find the plunger. I went out and purchased a plunger. When I returned it took me all of 30 seconds to have the toilet operating properly.At around 9:00 the next morning I went in and asked to see the manager. She refused to meet with me and advised the employee that she was on a conference call and wouldnt be available to meet until 2:00. I found this to be ludicrous and told the clerk so. I felt like making a scene but didnt as my children were there. When we returned from our day at Seaworld around 5:00 I met with the manager. She told me that it was good customer service to only offer a room change. I advised her of how much work it would that would have caused, and how disruptive it would have been to the young children and that it only took me a few seconds to fix the problem after I went out and bought the plunger. I told her she should be embarrassed about the customer service, she advised that she was proud of it and all of her employees. I asked for information on the ownership of the hotel, or her manager. She only would give me the choice 1-800 number. She actually stated that she didnt have that information. I asked for the name of who hired her she stated herself, I asked if she was the owner. She again would only say she didnt have that information. Earlier I had asked for compensation for the situation she insulting only offered to pay for the plunger. In the room was a card titled commitment to your Satisfaction, It stated states that if youre not satisfied with our accommodations or service, please the front desk know so we can make it right. At this property from the general manager on down they do not follow this policy. They definitely did not make it right.
0	Worn and needs renovation. Hole in shower, broken toilet seat. Facility is worn and needs to be updated.
1	Greatly Improved!. The last time I stayed here was about 20 years ago, this place was a dump. Because of this I was disappointed when it came up on Priceline. I'm a regular Marriott Rewards Elite member but usually stay at Courtyards. This just proves how one bad experience can influence decisions for many years. I was very, very pleasantly surprised when I walked thru the front door. Very attractive lobby, very friendly staff except for one bigger fellow at the front door who kept pushing for valet parking and unloading bags before we were even checked in. No tip for him, but everything was almost perfect from that point on. Very nice, attractive room, good a/c unit, quiet, and well designed. And very comfortable beds, good water pressure, and toiletries. With a walkway directly into Lenox and just across the street from Phipps the location is great. The drawbacks, 20 for self parking. You could probably avoid this by parking in a regular Lenox parking area but then again your car might not be there the next day. You do get in/out for no extra charge. The other negative is 12.95/day for inroom wifi but it does work. Supposedly it if free in public areas. The other drawback is food. The first night we were very tired and ordered room service. Expensive and bad. Too many good places nearby, so look elsewhere. Hope it comes up again. Definitely 4 star.
0	Very Dirty, Very Disappointing. I used Tripadvisor to review various properties at the Philadelphia airport before booking and the Fairfield Inn was highly rated so we booked. We were astonished to find that the reviews in no way reflect reality. I want to say first of all that the staff were professional, competent and extremely helpful, so this review in no way reflects on them. While the lobby and breakfast room were clean in appearance, the room was a completely different matter. It was shabby and filthy. The sheets and towels were clean but the furniture was sticky, the shower curtain had mold around the edges, and the chair in the room had multiple stains on the seat. The curtains and dust ruffles around the beds were very wrinkled and appeared to have been crumpled in a ball before being used. After noticing these things, I began looking more closely at other aspects of the hotel and noticed that the elevators were quite old and had not been cleaned well either. The hallway carpets appeared dirty and were rippled from stretching - they are obviously old as well and not kept up.This is the second worst hotel I've stayed in and I've stayed in a lot of hotels all over the world. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone or stay here or in another Fairfield Inn again. When you can't even sit on the chair in the room because it is so badly stained or touch the tops of the furniture because your fingers will stick to the top, it is pretty bad.Hello,Thank you for taking the time to provide your feedback. We take great pride in the service that we provide. Please contact me directly so that I may address your concerns immediately. Rest assured that I will go into every single room today to ensure we continue to reflect the highest cleanliness standards as this is extremely concerning to hear. We welcome all feedback in a positive manner even if it is not as favorable as we would like it to be. I look forward to speaking with you soon and thank you for staying with us while visiting the Philadelphia area!Yours in hospitality,Paulette Moore
0	America's Worst. This property does not look bad from out front, but room 118 is the worst I have ever seen anywhere. The dead bolt would not lock. The door chain was not secure.

1	A delightfully quirky hotel on Fisherman's Wharf. My wife and I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel. It is fun, convenient and has an abundance of friendly and helpful staff. The availability of clever games throughout was appreciated. The creative use of common materials, such as street signs folded into chairs and cargo containers was effectively creative.Hello Walter S, I am so glad you found our quirk ! being in such a cool modern space we just cant help but have fun here. I am so glad you found a bit of that here with us. I hope to see you again at the telescope !
0	Great location, but the structure should be renovated. The plus of this place is doubtless the location: in front of Disney parks entrance, just on the other side of the road!!Concerning the structure itself, interaction with the staff has been surely positive, all the people we met were really nice with us, but this is where positive aspects unfortunately stops...Rooms are old (bed creak, shower difficult to run) and unless you turn ac at max also really hot. The structure is also very noisy too: you can clearly hear people in the other rooms or, worse pulling their luggage on the gallery outside..
1	Reliable quality in great mid-town location. The hotel has been updated. The rooms are fresh and there is a new gym. You always get the best slip and fantastic linens, pillows, mattresses, etc. Bring your wallet though. A glass of white wine and a beer in the bar was 46!Dear Imrahil5000, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor. We hope to see you again soon!Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager
0	Not what I expected at a Wingate Hotel. Yes the receptionist was very professional, and upon enterence into the hotel it was nice and the breakfast was good. However I choose this hotel because of the name and it did not meet the standards that I'm use to when staying at a Wingate Hotel and for the price it truely did not match. The pictures looked better online than in person. The door to the hotel room did not open properly, the toilet was very loose and when me or the kids sat on it, it shook - the tub was not properly cleaned so we used the towels to put down on the bottom of the tub. The money I spent on the room did not match the quality of the hotel's name which is why I choose it. For what we got we could have stayed at a motel 6 for a approximately half the price. The computer really sits by the front door and not in a computer room.The location was O.K.Please accept my sincere apology regarding your recent stay at the BRAND of Wingate by Wyndham Atlanta Galleria. Teyonna what you experienced is not the standard we strive to uphold. We have reviewed our procedures and made appropriate changes to prevent this from occurring in the future. We look forward to having you as a guest with our Wingate BRAND in the future. Again, I am sorry for the inconvenience. Please contact me personally for your next reservation at our hotel.Willis Blake DOS
1	Excellent Hotel. Located on the edge of the French Quarter, this hotel is in a great location. It is far away from the party scene yet is easy walking distance to everything in the Quarter. It is not your typical hotel. Our room fronted the courtyard and was very nice for the rate we paid. The courtyard is quaint and relaxing. The breakfast is very good and has more of a restaurant feel and setup than your traditional hotel breakfast. The front desk staff was awesome and very informative. We only stayed one night, but are planning another week trip very soon.We are excited to hear that you will be back soon. We like to think of our guests as family and will be glad to see you when you return. Safe travels.Bryant Faul General Manager
0	So so. Confusing and less than desirable internet, front desk was no help. Room was so so. my particular room had an a/c that smelled like a dirty foot but perhaps it's just that room. Granite by rest room was weirdly stained, I'm not sure how that happens
0	Not Worth it!!!. First thing totally rude staff!! Front desk check in took a hour! Hidden 125 fee.. i booked trip advisor all fees payed i thought. Okay now to the hotel .. Dirty! Throw up in pool so we couldnt swim.. throw up in iceroom which is a empty piss smelled closet, could go on.. i wont!
1	Visit Anya in the spa!. I love the Estancia Spa and Anya in the nail salon. She helped me get ready for my wedding and welcomed me with open arms when I came back with both my family, and most recently, with my friends. She is thoughtful and extremely hard working. I'd recommend her services to anyone. The quality is exceptional. She's a gem inside of a stunning spa.Dear challidaypr,Thank you for being a loyal and frequent guest at The Spa at Estancia and for taking the time to share your review. We are truly grateful for the excellent rating you have awarded us and are thrilled to know how much you appreciate the exemplary service provided by Anya. We will be sure to share your comments with her, as she will be delighted to know how much you enjoyed her warm hospitality and expertise. Thank you for your high recommendation we hope to welcome you back to Estancia soon.
1	Amazing. The staff was wonderful all around from everywhere we were! Mike in Banquets did a fabulous job at the Banquet Dinner on Friday evening. He paid attention that I was drinking champagne instead of the wine that was being poured and refilled without asking. The simple things go a long way!! The grounds were gorgeous and well maintained, my room was relaxing and had everything that was needed, meeting space was comfortable and worked perfect for our group!Thank you for the wonderful hospitality! I can't wait to come back with my family!We are so happy to read about your recent business trip with us. Traveling for work can be stressful so we are so happy we were able to make your time with us so smooth. Mike as well as the rest of the team will be delighted to hear of your feedback, and we look forward to passing your kind words along. Its always a joy to hear when a quests notices the little things as we are constantly striving to meet the highest level of customer service. We cant wait to welcome you back with your family next time!
1	Great Experience. While on business travel, not sure why people need to pay outrageous prices to stay at a high end hotel. You end up paying for internet AND parking which raises the prices even higher. Your only in your room to sleep most of the time.This was an excellent hotel and as far as cleanliness, customer service and additional services... this compares to many of the higher end hotels I have stayed at. The rooms were just newly renovated to brand new and clean. Fridge, microwave, large TV and comfortable bed and free internet (fast too).Free breakfast (lots of choices) and free garage parking. Right across the parking lot is a gas station with fast food and lots of snacks and beverages for those late night needs.Simply excellent.
0	Mediocrity for the price. Centrally located, close to Pike Place and other key points of interest. Room was spacious, but unfortunately, I really missed their wonderful Heavenly Beds! They must not have these beds at this location, as one of the receptionists hadn't even heard of the Heavenly Beds! Further, the water pressure in my room, located on the 10th floor, was abysmal despite having housekeeping try to make an adjustment to the shower head valve. The water pressure out of the shower head was incredibly poor. The check-in experience was awkward since I couldn't hear well, as I had a late check-in (10pm), and the check-in desk is located in the loud hotel bar, which was pumping with bass and loud music. It was sincerly shocking that Emma, the pleasant check-in receptionist, asked if I would be willing to forego daily cleaning service in exchange for 500 Westin points per night! It's bewildering that this arguably 'five-star' hotel would even suggest such an option for their guests. I'll likely be trying other hotels in the neighborhood on future trips that will hopefully have stronger, more satisfying water pressure.Hello WillinLa, thank you so much for your feedback on your recent stay at W Seattle. My apologies, as it sounds like we failed to meet your expectations during your stay. We are always striving to make our guests' experience an amazing one, so your comments are extremely valuable to us to ensure we can make that happen. I do hope you'll give us another try and allow us to WOW you as we should have the first time. Thanks again.
1	Good budget option. The rooms were clean, well air-conditioned and large, with good bathrooms, basic cable TV and wireless Internet access. There's also a computer in the reception area. The desk service was very helpful and polite. There's a medium-sized outdoor pool. The complimentary breakfast includes many items, and you can make your own waffles. There is a shuttle bus until 10 pm to the metro stop, which is the last stop on the line. It takes 30-45 minutes to get to the center of Washington. The shuttle can fill up, and can take a while to pick you up. We did find parking at the metro stop lot, but that can fill up.
0	Not so bad if your there just .... Not so bad if your there just to fish, good enough to lay your head,after a long day nite of fishing, I will stay there again! Can't beat the price. Real close to the pier, Don't have to drive any where, The pier has all you need!!
1	Great Atlanta hotel, missing the bar. I've stayed at this hotel for 10+ years and it is continuing to get better. While traveling through Atlanta last night I made a point of spending the night here but I was very disappointed to find that on multiple occasions, the offerings were trimmed because of a group in the hotel. The bar was serving a limited off-menu food service and the breakfast buffet, even though the front desk said it was the full buffet was only a limited, cheaper option for the group. I was really looking forward to a waffle and omelet, which of course weren't on the buffet today. If you're going to offer special pricing for a group, don't not offer your non attending guests full options. Thank you for your feedback. I will be sure to share it with our team. We hope that you choose to stay with us again and give our hotel another try.
1	THE GOOD, BAD AND UGLY. ONLY HAS VALET PARKING WHICH IS A PAIN AS ON 1 TIME THEY HAD A LOT IS FULL SIGN OUT FRONT, SO HAD TO PARK IN A PUBLIC LOT 2 BLOCKS AWAY. ALSO 1 DAY WE DID NOT GET OUR NEWSPAPER--THEY RAN OUT AND TOLD ME I COULD WALK 3 BLOCKS AND BUY ONE. MY WIFE ORDERED ROOM SERVICE, IT NEVER CAME SO SHE CALLED AND IT WAS READY, NO ONE HAD BOTHERED TO BRING IT UP. THE FIRST DAY, HAD TO GET MAINTENANCE TO ROOM TO SHOW ME HOW TO TURN ON LIVING ROOM LIGHTS. ALL SORTS OR TRICKS NEEDED. ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, THE ROOM WAS CLEAN , SUPER BED TO SLEEP IN AND THE STAFF WAS REALLY NICE AND FRIENDLY.
1	Wonderful Service. The art deco decor and large floor to ceiling windows created a festive yet zen atmosphere. There was a hiccup upon check-in with the system being down but generally speaking, service was great and staff very friendly. After check-out I realized I was charged for something incorrectly and Chris addressed it immediately and was able to correct it without hesitation. Great location and intimate feel came with friends but will revisit with spouse.Thank you so much for taking the time to review your recent stay with us and we are delighted to know you had a great stay. We appreciate the feedback as it's very important to us and we will be sure to commend Chris for resolving the issue you encountered quickly and efficiently. It was a pleasure to have you as our guest and look forward to having you back for another visit real soon.Best regards,
1	Fantastic. Great location, bigger than expected room, clean and modern, love the way the hotel has been decorated, friendly helpful staff. Right on Fishermans Wharf. Easy transport near the hotel to see all of San Fran. Ask the staff for travel methodsWhat else can I say.Good day GeorgeRibarovski,Thank you from the friendly helpful staff at Hotel Zephyr for your post about us. We love our shipyard chic dcor as well and glad you liked it too. It takes time to post and I am glad when people share their positive experiences. We look forward to seeing you again on your next trip to San Francisco. See you soon,Jason WilliamsGeneral Manager
0	Awful Customer Service Marriott Platinum Fraud. This hotel was having their pool renovated without mention on their website (because they would lose bookings) and the Front Office manager on duty Christine - was one of the least professional hotel managers I've ever talked to. In short, she was rude and inconsiderate when asked questions. As Marriott Platinum members they give you a free item from their market per room to use during stay which SHE turned around and charged for on the credit card. Essentially they committed fraud and acted like they couldn't do anything to make situations right when guests are unhappy. Marriott is losing control of quality or they are becoming a very difficult brand. Either way, avoid this hotel - ESPECIALLY if you are an elite Marriott member. Christine - really doesn't belong anywhere near guests or the hospitality industry.Hello jbsdtraveler,Your Platinum status is certainly appreciated as well as your feedback. I will be personally looking into your communication and taking quick action to further improve service. Thank you for staying with us. At your service,Oscar. R.
1	Enjoyed!. I arrived a little earlier being I had been driving all night. I was ready to check into my room, but I had forgot that check-in time was at 3pm. I ask the desk clerk would it be ok if I could sit and wait the next 3 hrs in the lobby and she said yes. Well I guess she saw how tired I looked, she was nice enough to check with housekeeping to see if a room was ready. She allowed me to check in early and I am very grateful to her. Well I also want to commend the staff name Andre who were very helpful to make sure my stay at the hotel was satisfactory! Breakfast was stock when I went down and I was very please with the staff professionalism. I always stay at this hotel when I am in Suffolk, Va. Great Job
0	Great location...not much else. Your first difficulty if you drive to this location is going to be parking. Expect to pay up to 16.50 a day to park your car 2 blocks away at a parking garage. Once you get to the hotel you will need to climb 18 very steep stairs to get to the check in desk. No elevator. The staff are all very welcoming and helpful. Some of the rooms have windows that open into the hallway. I am sure that this may be quaint for some, but a huge privacy issue for others even if there is a blind that you can pull down. There are shared bathrooms (2 total) and you may be sharing it with 20 + other people. 2 showers are also shared. Not a lot of privacy. If your neighbors are loud, you will hear every single thing that is going on in the room next to you. The location is great with really everything within walking distance. Over all, this is an over priced hostel.Dear teasippinglou,Thank you for the nice comments about our location, cleanliness, and staff. Were sorry that there were some points that you did not meet with your approval. Bringing a car to San Francisco and parking it can be an expensive proposition. We advise guests to leave their cars at home, but we welcome those on a road trip and love them ourselves. Our rate for overnight parking is one of the best values in San Francisco. By comparison the hotel directly across from where we send our guests to park charges 45 per night and we charge only 16. Nob Hill hotels charge 60 per night and downtown hotels charge 62. So we feel our parking rate is very modest and a true value in keeping with our budget prices geared towards value-oriented travelers.The San Remo was built in 1906 and had no elevator. If anyone needs help with their baggage we would gladly bring their luggage up the one flight. The San Remo is only three stories high, is fully sprinkler-equipped, and is not required to have an elevator. Our stairs are up to code and are well lit. Were sorry that you missed some of our other bathing facilities but there are seven showers and a vintage claw-foot bathtub. They are all fully private and there is seldom any wait to use them. We are an historic Victorian hotel and not a hostel, although we are popular with backpackers looking for some comfort at a reasonable price. As far as our rates, we are well below the average for San Francisco. Rates within one block of our hotels great location range from 200 to 489. We have not had any complaints about privacy of our inside corridor rooms. They all have lace curtains and window shades. As far as noise, our walls are as thick as most other hotels, but due to the fact that we have no televisions which create a white-noise effect you may hear sounds that would normally be drowned out by them. We do provide ear plugs if needed.We hope you give us another try on your next trip from Alaska. When you return could you please say hello to Santa Claus for usTom Field
1	Very comfy hotel and friendly staff. Very comfy hotel. Hotels.com had overbooked on St. Patrick's Day Weekend!! This was one of the few hotels I could find in my price range where I wanted to be. The front desk upgraded me to a larger suite because it was my first stay and the room was very clean and comfortable. The windows actually open, which I loved. There is a weird separate seating space with a sink by the closet, but there was also a super nice complementary light up mirror to do your makeup in. The bed was very comfy and there was an extra blanket. Would stay again if I ever go back.Dear Lisa,Im glad to hear we met your expectations during your recent stay with us. Thank you for choosing Hotel Diva. We hope to see again soon.Warm regards,Virgil LopezHotel Manager
1	My Favorite Seattle Hotel. I have been staying at the W Seattle since 2010 and have never stayed anywhere else in Seattle as I enjoy my stay. The rooms are clean and comfortable, the cool corners are very nice. The staff over all these years is consistently hospitable and friendly. And the location is ideal, easily accessible to all of Seattle. I very much recommend you give it a try, and maybe you too will become a regular.Hi there foodplan!Thank your for sharing your kind words and feedback! It means a lot when we can have someone stay with us for as long and consistently as you have. Please keep us informed on all your future stays go, because we hope it's as good as all the previous ones.Jana
0	Not so good. I was highly disappointed this time around. This is my second time staying at this hotel and I did not like anything about our room. The 1st time we stayed here the room and price was great so we decided to stay again. We wanted a Jacuzzi and we were told in the room description that we would have one, but instead when we got to the room we had a regular jetted tub that did not work at all. We paid double for a room expecting something spectacular and we got nothing. The breakfast was okay, but it was so congested that you really could not enjoy your meal . Unfortunately, we will not be staying at this hotel again.
1	Good Location. The Hotel is within easy distance of both the French Quarter and the Warehouse district. This is a historic building built as a bank and office use, so rooms may be smaller than a normal hotel, but the building has character. The staff was 5 star by being attentive, friendly, and helpful. My room was very clean and comfortable. I will stay again.Thomas W, Thank you so much for the wonderful review of the Whitney Hotel and sharing your feedback with others on TripAdvisor! We greatly appreciate your comments and cant express to you our gratitude for your kind words about our hotel and our colleagues. I am very glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us! Thank you for the terrific review and for recognizing our great team for taking care of you. Thank you Again Thomas W.
0	A VERY DISAPPOINTING TRIP. I looked forward to staying at this hotel for so long and I was so disappointed. My room never got cleaned, the young lady at the front desk on Friday was just plain rude when answering questions about the hotel. There were numerous areas of the hotel that needed attention badly. From a distance it looks beautiful, but up close the hotel was just plain dirty and run-down. I fully realize this Best Western because of it's location does a huge volumn of business, which is all the more reason that things should be kept in much better condition. I would love to visit again because the views are wonderful and the beds are comfortable. However, the water running all night as well as the unkept grounds and bad service may cause me to change my mind. I am afront office manager at another BW location and I simply can't believe the things I saw and heard during my visit to this property.

0	Room with an odor. We checked in and noticed an odor similar to cat urine in first floor room. I called front desk, they contacted housekeeping and she came immediately to spray and request an ozone something. I called front desk back and asked for another room. They did not have one with two queens so we took a king. The front desk asked if we wanted a roll away and I said yes. We left for dinner and when we returned, no rollaway. I did not call desk back. All of us crammed on the king bed.
1	Classy, professional hotel. Stayed here for a week on a business trip, so got to know the hotel well. Very comfortable, well appointed with all you'd need (and expect) from a Grand Hyatt hotel. Convenient location in centre of downtown, close walking distance to office district, shopping, great selection of restaurants and 20 min walk from wonderful Pike Place Market. In-hotel restaurant is top end qualify, if slightly pricey, but good for breakfast. Service throughout the hotel is excellent, especially the guys out front who call you cabs.Tip for alternative breakfast option go to deli shop linked next door for great sausage muffins/ bagels coffee - delicious and served by lovely people.In summary, a great hotel from which to enjoy the city of Seattle!Thanks for your comments! It's wonderful that you felt happy and accommodated during your slightly longer stay our main goal is always to make sure that our guests feel valued and accommodated. We would love to have you back the next time your travels bring you to Seattle!Sarah S.Guest Relations Manager
0	The Chelsea should be ashamed of themselves. Halloween weekend a friend and I booked a room at the Annex so we could enter into the various Halloween contests at the Tropicana. A room at the Tropicana was too expensive for our budget so we booked at the Annex which is next door to the Tropicana. The neon red light that says The Annex was the first giveaway something was wrong. We started joking about ladies of the night and hourly rates as soon as we saw it. Then there was a blinking red light pointing upstairs and again we joked about older married men that need a place to bring young nave women. The hallways were Big Bird Yellow and the carpet was old and moldy in the hallways. The room was worse. There was a horrible smell in the room, the white lamp shades were egregiously stained and pieces of the bathroom floor tile were missing. I complained about the smell and I was given an upgrade at the Chelsea which was 100 times better than the Annex. I honestly think they will upgrade anyone that complains. If you don't complain and you aren't upgraded it will be the worse hotel you have ever stayed at - guaranteed.
0	Metro Points Washington DC. If I knew how far away and the sketchy neighborhood this hotel was, I never would have stayed there. There is nothing but fast food in the area and walking after dark is questionable. The room smelled of cleaning chemicals, the wireless service was weak, and maintenance did not come when called. No hairdryer - had to call the desk for one. Toilet paper holder falling off wall. They did a good job making this hotel look good in the pictures, but it was run-down. The van did come when they said it would, but be prepared to wait a long half-hour if you miss it.
1	Business and wedding weekend. Great staff.. the front desk, bell service, bar tenders and housekeeping all had a little play in our stay. All performed 100. Great room over the courtyard.. a little noisy on Friday night, but that is to be expected. Clean room, extra towels, great directions from the front desk, they were short some people so the front desk guys brought and took our luggage. Talk about location... walk to Petco Park, bars an restaurants are within 50 feet. Mall is appx 5 blocks. Park the car and walk around. Weather was horrible.. 87 degrees and humid (that's horrible for San Diego), felt like 100 degrees, but the room was cool. Will I stay here again EVERY TIME. Room 319 on 08/15 for 2 nights.
1	Great location! A 3 on renovation, but has character.. Great location with great restaurants around and shopping. Love Churchill's Cigar lounge with a very good wine list! Within walking distance all. Street fair on the weekends...........................Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to tell us what you thought! So glad you enjoyed the wine at cigars at Churchills and the street fair in Old Town on the weekends. Our location is quite convenient to both and the street fair is a big hit with most guests! Have an amazing summer, and we look forward to seeing you again!
1	Quick jaunt. Overall, good trip. Clean and friendly! It was mid summer when we stayed and we prefer ice cold room. Couldn't get it cool enough. Bed was comfy. Pillows a bit too thick for us. Cold water at faucet was warm to hot. Shower temp was perfectly hot. Would recommend more mirrors in room. A safe would be good addition and fridge. Enjoyed continental breakfast. Would stay at this beautiful hotel again. Thank you for the great review and your recent visit to the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans. We certainly appreciate you kind words and will pass them on the staff. It's our pleasure to provide excellent customer service to our guests. We look forward to hosting you again in the very near future. Sincerely, Jason LaBicheGuest Service Manager

1	3 Times , Tried and True. This will be the third time we have stayed at this hotel. It is a very nice hotel with all the ammenities you would need but not all you might find in a five star hotel. But , considering the location to the airport, Amtrak Location, and Old Town ( a very nice array of restaurants,bars and gift shops in a revitalized set of buildings dating back to the late 1880's. You can walk and see a great deal. Legoland is about 45 minutes north of the hotel in Carlsbad. And, about 20 minutes from the San Diego Zoo. Both attractions are family related . You will spend the entire day at each location. Back at the hotel, you will find a parking fee of 10.00 a night. The restaurant located just at the back of the facility has a nice bar,with lots of t.v.s playing sporting events and a restaurant that offers a nice meal at a 10- 20 range . Here's the deal though ! If you are a AAA Automobile member, you can't get a better deal ,period! If you use your AAA card you pay up 20 off per night, 50 off the parking per night and 2 free buffet breakfasts each day of your stay. Use the card and you will return home filled with happy thoughts knowing you had a great time and won't have a huge credit card bill the following month.Thank you for your loyalty! Were honored to receive such a thoughtful recommendation. Indeed, our plethora of amenities plus an excellent location, make us a prime choice for San Diego tourists and business travelers alike. Dont hesitate to reach out to us if there is every anything we can do to make your stay even better.
0	Horrible. I was working so I ordered room service which came in 4 stages. Every time I sat down to work, the doorbell rang with another part of the room serviced dinner I ordered. It was ridiculous. The room was also small compared to other rooms in Chicago. I could not recommend it.Dear catherinemQ2687CP, Thank you for staying at the Conrad Chicago. I'm terribly sorry about your room service experience, the lack of flawless service provided and the interruptions you experienced are one of great concern. I'm sorry that you experienced this and it is not service typical of our hotel. Please reach out to our Director of Operations, Thomas.Shorttconradhotels.com so that we can try our best to ensure a future flawless stay for you. Sincerely, Tod Chambers
1	Newer Hotel, Great Customer Service, Quiet. We had a corner suite on the 8th floor this past weekend and were pleasantly surprised by the large size of the room and bathroom. Upon check-in, we were told that the pool and roof bar were on the 9th floor. We had concerns about possible noise only being one floor down, but our stay was very quiet throughout the weekend. Pluses:The room was very clean and nicely furnished. Customer service was excellent. We called the front desk to request a fridge for medication and it was delivered within 5 minutes. We also saw a couple gift items in the gift store early on Sunday morning before our flight out but the shop had not opened yet. The manager was kind enough to open the store for us an hour beforehand so that we could make our purchases. The hotel is only a short 5-10 mins walk from the French Quarter. High quality, soft toilet paper and high quality toiletries and linens provided. Nice brushed nickel finishes in the bathroom. Complimentary water in the room.Minor Issues:King-sized bed was a bit lumpy and sagged except for the middle. We would have preferred a smoother, firmer mattress. The power buttons and volume buttons on both remote controls for the TVs did not function. The next day, we finally found the joystick button on the bottom middle frame of each TV to control the volume and power. We did not use the pool, but it is very small.We are delighted you enjoyed your time at NOPSI. Let us know when you are travelling back to NOLA and we will ensure your stay is most memorable.

1	Beautifully Landscaped Quaint Lodging. I stayed at The Estancia La Jolla Hotel Spa for 2 nights while in the San Diego area for business. The property is beautifully landscaped and hotel staff give their best efforts at guest service. I liked the place, and would stay again when in the area.The hotel seems to be primarily geared toward the wedding and event industry. Large group events tend to be the norm, and an attitude of revenue capture over guest experience was evident to me. A nightly Hospitality Service Fee of 17 and a nightly parking fee of 25 are charged on every room category (including suites). In my opinion, the resort could elevate the guest experience a bit by either discreetly handling such fees (i.e. including in the room charge), or to communicate such fees during the reservation process (surprises at check out tend to feel deceptive at the consumer level). Wifi was included in the price of the room, however.The interiors are at the age where they could use a refresh. They are just on the verge of feeling dirty and old. The good news is, they aren't bad enough that every guest would notice.Liked it, would stay again, don't love it as a Destination.Thank you very much for your honest feedback and sharing your photos on Trip Advisor. We are truly very sorry you were not 100 satisfied with your stay. It is with great pleasure that we do indeed welcome many leisure and business guests- as well as meeting and event guests. The Resort Fee is a industry standard and we must remain competitive to this. Again, thank you for your feedback.

1	Family vacation. Excellent hotel for location and price. Had two rooms for seven people and found them very comfortable. Rooms were spacious with comfortable queen beds. Would have like to have breakfast included at this price.Dear Smrboston,Thank you for taking the time to share your recent family vacation experience at Hotel Sorrento.We were thrilled that you enjoyed your visit! Your comment regarding breakfast is well received. We have been discussing lately the cost surprise that many Guests have with breakfast. We currently offer a BB package which is very useful and a better value and by the end of July we are testing a coffee feature in our fireside lounge, for the busy morning period that will offer delicious and quick options, along with the Dunbar's regular sit down menu. Your feedback seems right on target with our thoughts.I hope that you will find a reason to return, and see for yourself the options we are adding to breakfast to delight our Guests.Thank you again for choosing to stay with Hotel Sorrento.At Your Service, Shannon Sheron, Managing Director
0	Horrible, closet like rooms with no air conditioning.... I will never consider staying at the Whitney after my epic night of uncomfortable room temperatures and a night's sleep on the hardest, cheapest mattress I've every experienced. The hotel staff was nonexistent and are complaints were only listened to AFTER check-out.Thank you for your review. I'm sorry to hear that we did not exceed your expectations but we'll use this information to provide better services in the future. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to hear about your visit. Sincerely,Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
1	DC trip to 9er game. The hotel offered many amenities that were beneficial to us for the reason for our stay such as, comfortable rooms and breakfast. Upon arrival a round trip service from the hotel to stadium was being offered for 20 dollars a person. We immediately jumped on the deal due to being unfamiliar with the area, as well as my wife expecting our first baby. She is restricted to the amount of walking she is to do and we didn't want to walk to and from the metro station in the dark. Our driver never picked us up at the drop off location, when speaking to him he misled us to where we were to go to meet him, he hung up on us and a police officer, and shut off his phone. We didn't get picked up until an hour and half after the game by the boss of the company. The whole ordeal was very frustrating and unorganized. We did get half of our money back from the second driver/boss of the company. When returning to the hotel the staff didn't seem concerned with the mishap. I don't think the hotel hired a credible company to provide shuttle services to their guests. Any guest should be cautious about using an outside shuttle service provided by this hotel.
1	Orlando Family Trip. We had an excellent experience at the Hilton Garden Inn by the Orlando Airport. Everyone was very friendly and helpful and the room was very clean. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! I stayed there earlier in the year for a business trip and found everything to be excellent at that time also. Very accommodating for any and all requests. We were also give warm delicious cookies in the evening!Dear Guest Carina D, I would like to thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to write about your experience during your stay at the Hilton Garden inn Orlando Airport. We know that when traveling our guests have many options to choose from and we value and deeply appreciate your loyalty and support. Your comments have been communicated to all our associates and posted in our bulletin board as a reminder of how much we can impact our guests in a positive way and a job well done.Our team prides themselves in the quality of their work striving for 101 to exceed our family guest's expectations every day. We are looking forward to welcome you to once again provide you with an outstanding level of service and nothing less. Sincerely,Alex BlancoGeneral Manager

0	Virginian Suites. The hotel was nice but a bit old. The air conditioning did not work well in either of the rooms in which we stayed. In the evening we were told breakfast was available in the hotel. In the morning we were told our rooms did not include breakfast and it appeared that only high end rooms quailfied for breakfast. So we had to leave the hotel to eat. Over all I was dissatisfied and would not stay at this hotel again.
0	Bang..bang...bang...bang...bang... bang....bang..... We arrived to find out that the hotel was under refurbishment. We checked into a King Suite on the ground floor (115) and were staying over a weekend (saturday to monday night inclusive). I realise this is a business hotel and the weekends are quiet so it provides the opportunity to refurbish but here is a thought. This is a 2 wing hotel, one wing on each side of the pool. If I were the General Manager I would have arranged the refurb to take place in one wing and then the other thus limiting disturbance to 50 of the hotel and keeping it 100 isolated. Instead the refurb is happening on the third of three floors on both wings and banging noises can be heard throughout the entire hotel. We are frequent travellers and we always require the hotels we stay in to be quiet and 100 comfortable. My wife was ill with a stomach bug and needed to sleep. My daughter is a 20 month old toddler and needs to take sleeps throughout the day. The constant hammering from the workmen prevented this. I contacted the front desk 3 times to complain and the banging continued despite assurances it would be dealt with. I eventually walked to reception with my daughter in my arms and made my grievance known to the staff that I felt I was not being listened to. I was then contacted by staff and told I could move if I wished to another room where no noise was guaranteed. I think they fail to see the point. I don't see why guests should have to repack all their belongings and move to accomodate the disturbance. The disturbance should move or quit to accomodate the guests. It's not rocket science. It's a shame because the hotel is nice and the staff are pleasant. I am not usually easily rattled but banging noises in a hotel - NO WAY!Please allow me to extend my sincerest apologies for the noise disturbance during your stay. I can assure you that many months of careful planning have gone into our renovation and the decision to renovate by floor rather than wing was made based on a number of factors, one being guest safety. Based on the layout of our rooms and elevator location, a different plan would have required our guests to walk through a construction zone to reach their rooms. Not every stage of the renovation is affiliated with noise and the fast majority of our guests are not disturbed at all. I am truly sorry that your wife and daughter were not able to rest peacefully and hope we can make it up to you during your next visit.
0	Poor Management. The manager uses foul language referring to poorly trained staff. Staff does not know how to issue credits after they fail to honor the rate quoted. The rooms are poorly cleaned with light bulbs burned out and never replaced. Staff consists of young children that cannot make decisions nor are mature enough to deal with challenges.
0	Will not stay here again. Could not access wi-fi. Ice machines shut down and was advised to go to Hampton Inn and get some. Showers still have a straight shower rod. Really, it's 2015, get a curved shower bar. No one wants to take a shower with the shower curtain touching them!!

0	Needs New Management. I am a Platinum Marriott Rewards member and stayed here in July 2015 for the fourth of July weekend when I ran the Peachtree Roadrace 10k race. The location and stay were great, however, the hotel hit my credit card for no show charges which was a complete error on the hotel's part. I have contacted the hotel many times and while they promised me they will take care of the problems, to date they have not provided me with a refund for the false charges. It is now 3 months later and the problem remains unresolved. This hotel is poorly managed and needs new management. Although I stay at the JW Marriott brand in many cities, based on my experience, I cannot recommend this hotel and will not stay here again.

1	Perfect plan for the Farmers Open. We stayed here while attending the Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines Golf Course. It could not have been better. Every staff member we encountered was kind, friendly, knowledgeable and helpful beyond their duties, especially reception staff (Devon). They were kind enough to offer us a shuttle directly to the East Gate of the golf course in both directions, at OUR convenience, which made everything so much more enjoyable. The room was well-appointed and clean, with a very comfortable bed. The amazing spa ... a couples massage room with all the amenities and truly wonderful staff. The only less-than-enjoyable item would be the room service, but it was handled immediately so that I hate to complain at all -- we had a very nice and comfortable stay, and look forward to our next visit.
1	Absolutely no complaints about this hotel!. This hotel is amazing! The rooms are spotless, beds are incredibly comfortable, staff is nice. The gym is incredible, with personal TVs on every machine and ice cold towels to cool off with. The location is great, with shopping every way you turn. While my husband was in business meetings, I kept myself busy roaming the stores in the area. It is an easy walk to Pike's Place Market, which is a must-see experience! So many awesome vendors with unique items to sell. It's the only place I have ever found something personalized with the correct spelling of my daughter's name. :) It was my first visit to Seattle, and I had a wonderful time. The hotel was perfect in every way. I would recommend to all.Thank you for your review. It sounds like you had a great time! It's wonderful that you were able to find all the great places to shop and visit while your husband was in meetings we always hope to accommodate all of our guests whether they are here for leisure or business or both! We hope to see you back again on your next visit to Seattle.Sarah S.Guest Relations Manager
1	A Really Great Stay!. This is a nice hotel in a good location close to some shopping and several food options. Because of its setup, it is pretty quiet at night which is nice considering it's on a main drag. The woman at the main desk was very pleasant and got us checked in quickly with no wait. It was around 8:00pm when we got there.The room was spacious and clean which is always appreciated especially at a reasonable price. My only complaint was that the ice machine on our floor was broken and most of the drink selections were empty so we had to go back down to the main floor to find what we were looking for.The breakfast was decent for the price we paid. There was fruit, yogurt, eggs, cereal, juice, bagels and waffles. The standard spread that one would expect. The food was continually stocked which was nice. My only complaint was the seating was very limited. There was not enough room for the amount of people showing up to breakfast, so we and a couple other groups had to stand for a while until someone offered us a seat.There also is a pool at this hotel which looked nice, but unfortunately, I didnt get to try it out. But from the looks of the people out on the patio, people loved it and it looked very well kept.I would definitely stay here again!
0	loud. I know this is an old building. The rooms are not sound proof. I heard very clearly the conversation the mother was having with her children in the next room. The shower did not get hot, warm enough, but not hot.
1	Fun trip, great place!. This hotel is perfect for going to do all the fun things in Seattle at Seattle Center. You can walk to everything and there are many restaurants in the immediate area.Love everything about the hotel great service took care of all of our needs, the only thing that I would ask is that if they do have room to grant your request for late out. They have a policy absolutely no late checkouts which is OK. Not a dealbreaker.Debbie F,It was a pleasure to have you as our guest recently at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown and it is exciting to hear that you found the staff to be helpful and inviting. I will share your feedback with all of the team who has been consistently recognized as exceeding customer service standards.

0	Internet is unusable. I am on a business trip. The service is like dial up. I already changed rooms to get a signal. I am using my Iphone to connect. Talked to someone from their ISP named Kevin. Completely worthless. Never called me back and didn't fix a thing,
0	Not worth the convenience. This hotel is in great proximity to downtown Atlanta. That being said, it still isn't worth the deal. We arrived at 3:30, with the understanding that check in was at 3. When I walked in, there's no one at the front desk and there was a sign that read Be back in 10 minutes, if you're checking out, just leave your room key. I thought that strange but hung around for a bit before I finally got tired of waiting, and my friend and I decided we would go eat and come back. So I come back and there is a gentlemen in front of me checking in and someone at the front desk this time.... so good sign. Boy did I stand in line FOREVER. I did mention that fact that I tried to check in earlier there was no one at the front desk and the clerk was incredibly dismissive and I think the fact I said anything made him want to take even longer to check me in which really ticked me off. We get to our room the air unit wasn't on so it was incredibly stuffy and smelled of mildew. The beds looked felt prison issued and one of the blankets looked like it hadn't ever been washed. I will say the bathroom was very clean and I appreciated that. There's only one elevator and you can fit about 3 people max in it that's without luggage. Oh and GA does some thing where you have to pay an extra 5 now. So whatever the website says your price is, add 5. When I checked out the next morning, the front desk girl made it abundantly clear that I was inconveniencing her by checking out and asking for a receipt. If we had planned to stay more than one night, I would have left went somewhere else immediately. The whole place was very sketchy so be mindful if you decide to stay here.
1	Orlando Airport hotel delivers. the Hilton Garden at Orlando airport lives up to the Hilton standards. The hotel staff is warm and welcoming. The rooms comfortable and quiet. Acces to the airport is less than 2 miles and there was no airport noise detected in the rooms. Not a common experience when staying near an airport.Dear Guest minneapolispat, I would like to thank you on behalf of my team for your kind comments on our performance and your experience on your stay. We know that when traveling our guests have many options to choose from and we value and deeply appreciate your loyalty and support.

We are looking forward to welcome you, family and friends to once again provide you with an outstanding level of service and nothing less. Sincerely,Alex BlancoGeneral Manager
1	Awesome location and Staff. This hotel not only is a great value but is in a perfect location in Buckhead. Unlike many other hotels in the area, parking and wifi is free. What really made this hotel special was the staff. Tony, Damar, Kim, and Francene were all extremely helpful and are very good at recommending good places to eat. The King bed I had was extremely comfortable and had a nice desk in the room. The morning breakfast actually exceeded my expectations.Thank you so much for your review. We enjoy being able to provide optimal customer service for our guests! We look forward to seeing you again should your travels bring you back to the Buckhead area.
0	Guest. I did not like the fact that my card on file was previous charged before I checkin and I had the hardest time getting my funds credited back because one of the rooms reserved was done with cash upon arrival.Kristina,For all special events in New Orleans our reservations are full prepaid, so guests get charged before arrival. This was stated during your reservation process. We do this for events like Mardi Gras, Jazz Fest, Essence Fest, and graduation weekends. I'm sorry if this caused any confusion, but it is our policy. Kathleen Davis, Front Office Manager
1	What a welcome!. I arrived in the lobby of the beautiful Kimpton Allegro on a busy Saturday night looking for a group of friends. Immediately, Sandy Gallagher (The Guest Experience Manager what a great job title!) asked if I needed some help. She escorted me around to all the hidden little intimate alcoves of the lobby until I found my group. Wow!We truly appreciate you writing this review on your stay! I'm so glad I was able to make a great first impression for our hotel. It was a pleasure meeting you, and we look forward to welcoming you back soon!
0	A disgrace. This is a case of another Vegas hotel that thinks that just because this is Vegas it can treat its patrons like cattle. When you drive up to the hotel there is a sign to self parking. No sign for valet, just self parking. So you follow the sign to find yourself in a gigantic and full parking lot with... More
0	Worst Experience of my Life. Idk what was worse rude lady at the front desk or the smell coming from the carpet. It turned my feet black! How gross is that! To start my trip I had to reschedule and apparently they wasn't allowed. I'm sorry my son came home from over sees as and surprised me. When I called the lady and explained my... More
1	Clean, friendly, great location!!!. So glad we chose Hotel Diva, staff was super, hotel was clean and convenient location. Loved its style! We stayed for two weeks and got upgraded to a suite, reminded me of a little studio. Check out photos, what you see is what you get! Nothing fancy but classy in its decoration! Bed very comfortable!!!Hi Diana PThank you so much for taking the time to write such a nice review and share it with other travelers. It is very important for us to know what made your experience so special. Please let us know if we can be of any assistance in planning for your next trip to San Francisco. We look forward to seeing you soon at Hotel Diva!Best RegardsVirgil LopezHotel Manager
0	Air Conditioning couldn't cool the room. I'm a Marriott Platinum Elite member. I stay at Marriott hotels 100+ nights each year. I gave this hotel a try in May of 2016. It's a nice, modern hotel in a good location, with all the amenities typically found at a Springhill Suites.However.....the Air Conditioning unit couldn't cool the room. I ran it all night and it never succeeded in getting the room temp below 70 degrees.Hotels MUST allow their guests to keep the room at the temperature they desire. This means installing AC units that are powerful enough to cool the rooms to the desired temp.This Marriott failed in that regard, and thus I cannot recommend, nor do I plan to return.This is so disappointing to see, and I'm so sorry that your room wasn't up to par. My team and I would have been more than happy to fix it in the moment, but I appreciate the feedback nonetheless. I hope you can give us another shot to show you the stay you deserve. Best, Frank F., General Manager
0	you get what you pay for. Room smelled like cigarette smoke. Bunch of guys from another room having a party, being rowdy and getting drunk in parking lot right near office until 3AM. Clerk did nothing to quiet them down, call the police, etc. I was a little concerned when door to office locked at night and saw a sign for weekly rates. I will no longer stay in motels with outside doors. Accommodations would not have been terrible but I guess when room is too cheap, maybe doesn't attract best crowd.
1	Convenient place for attractions. If you have to stay downtown San Diego, this is a nice, not too expensive place. It's easy to get to the Zoo and Balboa Park without having to fight the I-5 traffic. The place is cute, but modest, not sure it qualifies as a Plus.Dear Hwa-Chun L, Thank you for your comments regarding your stay at Best Western Plus Garden Inn.Our property qualifies to be a Best Western Plus based on the room dcor, amenities as well as the hotel location.Thank you again for your feedback and we are looking forward having you as a guest at our property in the near future.Y Chen General ManagerBest Western Plus Cabrillo Garden Inn
1	Convenient to convention center. Room was clean and comfortable. Hotel is secure, room key is required to access floors the rooms are on. Staff is friendly and accommodating. Convention center is one block away. Lot's of restaurants nearby that will satisfy all budgets.Dear itraveltheworld2013,It was a pleasure to have you as our guest at the Courtyard Philadelphia Downtown. We are pleased to read our location was ideal for your needs and that you were impressed with your well-appointed room and our helpful associates. Your feedback is much appreciated, and we hope to have the honor of hosting you again soon.Thank you, David KiddAssistant General Manager
1	Great Stay!. Location was perfect. Service was very good. Loved our room. So cozy but with plenty of room. Decor was nice. Safe place to park your vehicle. Trolley came right by the hotel and took us to Bourbon street. Nice restaurant nearby. I would def. stay here again when coming to NOLA. It sounds like you and your family had a great trip to New Orleans! I'm glad y'all enjoyed your room and our location. We are close to a lot of great places, but not too far away from other attractions in the city.Let us know when you are ready to plan your next trip here!Kathleen Davis, Front Office Manager
1	Enjoyed My Stay. I stayed three nights and thought the staff went out of their way to anticipate my needs and make my stay comfortable. Not being familiar with San Diego, I appreciated the easy access to I-8 and the convenient location. Most importantly I felt safe, both in the motel and the surrounding area. Motel is two stories but I heard no noise from other rooms or outside and found my room quiet.I am an early riser and enjoyed getting my continental breakfast and free USA Today each morning and going out by the outdoor pool to sit. The area is nicely landscaped with lots of flowers and shrubs.The room was exceptionally clean and alrhough on the small side had everything I needed. I would definitely stay here again.Hello Joan W, Your 5 star review is greatly appreciated by our entire staff here at the Lamplighter Inn! Our goal is to provide spotless rooms, superior customer service and amenities that make our guests stay as comfortable as possible. It sounds like you were able to enjoy our hotel to the fullest and that makes us happy! We are glad you found us to be conveniently located. We are only about 20 minutes from most of the main attractions in our beautiful city. SDSU is only a mile away making it accessible for friends and family to visit students, as well as concert goers and sports fans attending events on the campus. Our front desk staff are ready to help with directions or suggestionsjust ask! Again, thank for your positive words!

0	Yup.... Stayed here for one night before leaving town. The room was OK. Although we had a minor plumbing issue and we were just handed the tools to fix it ourselves. Otherwise, the night was quiet and the room was fairly well kept. Just an OK stay.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for taking the time in reviewing the Best Western Plus Miramar San Diego. We appreciate you bringing up your concerns with our property as well and apologize for any inconvenience that may have been caused. We are happy to hear that your room was fairly well kept. We strive to work hard in providing a well maintained property and are glad that you took notice. Thank you again for reviewing the Best Western Plus Miramar San Diego. We hope to see you during your next trip to San Diego. Thank you!
1	Enchanted by Estancia. San Diego, being one of our favorite places, we decided to try Estancia.The hotel is tucked away off the main road, a short car ride from La Jolla, the beach, Del Mar Racing, Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve and several golf courses. I adored the lush grounds and the Spanish/Ranch style architecture. We had a lovely, sunny comfortable room overlooking the fountain courtyard which made it very peaceful. The staff was amazing, they deserve 5 Stars! They are friendly, engaging and genuinely want to make your visit a memorable experience. I'm not usually a fan of hotel restaurants, but breakfast on the veranda overlooking the courtyard was delightful and yummy. The hotel was busy the holiday week we visited, two weddings and several meetings along with resort guests like ourselves. We were concerned that it might get noisy. It was never an issue, we were not disturbed by any of the activities, we actually enjoyed the quartet playing at one of the ceremonies below in the courtyard. On Thursday, we had an interesting Landscape Tour provided by the hotel plant lady, which also gave some of the hotel history. I think it's noteworthy to mention Estancia's environmentally friendly practices, I appreciate businesses respecting our planet. I hated to leave this tranquil, enchanting environment, but can't wait to return.Dear Nina92515,Thank you for choosing to stay at Estancia and for taking the time to share your comments. We are so delighted that you were enchanted by our resort and thoroughly enjoyed your accommodations, the beautiful grounds, and the delicious cuisine here at Estancia. We are further delighted that you experienced the world-class hospitality that we strive to provide for our guests. Thank you for your excellent rating and we hope to welcome you back soon for another tranquil and enchanting getaway!
0	DO NOT BOOK ONLINE!!!!. I have stayed at this hotel once or twice a year for quite some time. Its a decent hotel, nothing spectacular, unless you want to get drunk and ride a mechanical bull at the bar really, but other than that its a decent hotel. I recently booked a room online, where I was charged immediately, but there is also now... More
1	Relaxing and spacious.. A great location for a large group. Villa sleeps 10. On site activities provided yet our mission was Disney. Only 10 minutes. Nowadays when you stay on the property you are just as far. Easy walk to Marriott world and the largest pool in Florida. Although site provides pool and hit tub. Shuttles provided to work world center.We found pizza and Chinese's who deliver or many places nearby. Even use the concierge to get you all set. Only setback was an anticipated Full pullout in one room only to have a twin. As we had 5 little ones it didn't put us out but ask if thinking on all days.
0	Not a good option for business travellers.. My flight was delayed and I arrived late into San Francisco.As the reservation had been made by our corporate travel agent I asked to add my Joy of Life club number. The somewhat unfriendly front desk agent informed me I couldn't do this as only online reservations were eligible. I took the elevator to to 4th floor to find I had been assigned a room facing Bush street on the 4th floor. The main issue was it was opposite the stairs and elevator, which meant lots of noise. I returned to the front desk but was informed they could not change rooms as they were sold out. Needless to say I didn't get the best nights sleep.I travel to San Francisco several times a year but will not be staying at the Rex or any other Joie de Vivre properties.Dear Nick,Thank you for taking the time and post a review about your stay at the Hotel Rex on Tripadvisor. I'm truly sorry that we were not able to find a room to your liking. I can assure you that it is our highest priority to train our staff so that can provide excellent service - something we obviously failed to do during your stay.We genuinely value the feedback our guests provide both when we get it right and when we fail to do so as it is extremely helpful for us to discover areas in which we need to improve our service and operations.Please do not hesitate to contact me directly if you wish to discuss this further.Kindest regards,Lorenz MaurerGeneral ManagerHotel Rexlmaurerjdhvotels.com415 217 4023
0	Better late than never. I stayed at this hotel in September 2012 for five nights at the end of my six week honeymoon in North and South America. I know you get what you pay for however, this hotel was a complete dissapointment and a sour end to an amazing holiday. It's on the border of the tenderloin district which is known as the... More
0	Meh. There weren't enough towels and washcloths placed in the room before our arrival. When I asked for two more, they only had one washcloth the other washcloths and towels had yet to be washed. They didn't have food available for the Grab Go Breakfast initially, but the manager pulled something together eventually. The staff is very nice, however, and the hotel is very convenient to dining, shopping, and touring.
1	Mini-Honeymoon.... I was very excited about the occasion - our short honeymoon (longer one to follow on our first anniversary) but was disappointed by one thing...the bathroom in the DoubleTree was so small that you had to actually come into the room and move over to the side JUST to close the door. Maybe it was because we had the special price rate, but I expected better from a Hilton brand hotel... Other than that, the room was nice, average size and the staff was very friendly. When they saw us come in (we were still in tux and wedding gown), they offered congratulations and of course, the cookies were excellent!!!
0	You get, what you pay for.. The biggest problem of this hotel is the location, the hotel itself is not that bad. It is clean in general, rooms are very tiny, it doesn't have a fridge and microwave. So basically that's a fine place to sleep, have shower and not more than this. So, If you plan just to sleep in that hotel several nights, it is fine. The hotel can't be blamed, that the district is full of homeless, hookers, drug dealers and junk. However, that district it still in historical part of the city and very close to the Market St and the tram lines.
1	Older Hotel with a wonderful staff. One can quickly tell this is an older facility. However, is close to Fisherman's Wharf and other San Francisco attractions. Our room was large and comfortable although carpet moles were obvious. Nice area on the third floor for enjoying a libation and watching the sun set over the Golden Gate Bridge. Staff are very pleasant and helpful. A free light breakfast is included. Also very nice to be at a place with free covered parking. Would stay there again! Was the first time I had seen an envelope for tips placed in the room by housekeeping staff.
0	Bring your own towels and some bug spray. Check in was quick. Room was clean. About 11pm we called to the front desk for a blanket. 15 minutes later, still not there. We called back to the front desk, to inquire as to the blankets location. We were then told they did not have available staff to bring it up. I went to the front desk to retrieve it. Surprise, 2 people at the desk. The next morning I called for some towels. 20 minutes later, called again. Another 20 minutes, we were sharing towels. They never showed. One of the adults in our party found bed bugs! I went down to the front desk and asked for a manager. He did not want to come out of his room, stating he didn't get back to his room until very late. After some insistance, he showed up. His answer was to give me a 10 gift card to Target. I like most of the Garden Inns we have stayed at. This one will never see me again.
0	GOT ROBBED AT GUN POINT IN HOTEL ROOM !. This place is unsafe... the camera's don't work, or atleast weren't working at the time when the police needed it for their investigation... they even had the nerve to charge me for blood stains on the carpet resulting from my attack which took place at 10 am in the morning !! The excuse was that it may have been someone I met 2 nights before that set me up ...But after much investigation and reflection it had to have been an inside job because it had nothing to do with that person as I was to later find out.But when you think about it, common sense would tell you if a hotel agent delivered items the evening before only that person could reasonably infer you would be sleeping over until the morning....be that as it may the after-care was extremely disappointing and I have stayed in many hotels... I'm still in shock to this day !!!
1	Spend the on the SPA Room!. Single best bath tub Ive ever used in my life. Holy hell it was a better bath than the 1400a night Pelican Hill! Decor was great. Staff were amazing. Only downside is the AC was broken and the beds are only just above average. Overall love it. P.S. dont park at the hotel. 24/7 secure parking is one block up at 6th and Market for 38 LESS per night. Glad you enjoyed one of our Jacuzzi rooms, ManagmentBee. Sorry the AC wasn't working. That's definitely a one-off and hope it was fixed quickly. We'll see you next time. Justin- AGM
1	Excellent Hotel, Excellent Staff. This review is long overdue.This hotel hasn't let me down, (resort I should say)I'm a picky guy when I spend 400+ a night on a room. I want to be treated well, I want staff to acknowledge my presence, and I want them to be courteous and kind and helpful and most importantly quick.In a consumers' world, we have to pay attention to detail. Otherwise the providers will become lazy..At the St. Regis, attention to detail is not a problem. To say the least, they go overboard.All the rooms are cleaned to perfection before arrival, I've stayed here a total of 6 times and have never found something from the room beforeRoom service is of 4-5 Star quality food, hot and ready and fresh.Do not tip the room service, the gratuity is already factored in. Unless you feel like splurging.Amazingly well done eentree choices ordered directly to your room..The reason I go to hotels, is to escape life, go to the spa, sit in my room, watch movies, and be waited on.This hotel does it all.For a Price.a 3 day ultimate vacation as I like to call it, room service once a day, and the spa once a day,Can easily run you over 2000-3000 Dollars here.If you want to just enjoy the room and resort, you can get away with spending 900-1200 on a room for 3 nights and just enjoying yourself.My first stay here was with a Mercedes Benz Voucher way back in the day.Thanks Mercedes Benz, you introduced me to a fantastic resort!Dear Patrick B,Thank you for taking the time to share your review of The St. Regis San Francisco. We sincerely appreciate your loyalty to our hotel and your kind words regarding our staff and service. I am pleased that we have been have to provide you with a five star experience, and look forward to welcoming you to back to Best Address soon.Sincerely,Charles WilliamsDirector of Front Office415-284-4031Charles.williamsstregis.com
1	Awesome hotel and people. Like Best Western hotels and choose this hotel because it offered free parking and was on the St Charles street car line. Hotel is charming and the staff was so very friendly. Rooms were clean, spacious and breakfast was good. Beds were very comfortable. Loved that there were tables and chairs so we could sit outside. The garden district is so quiet compared to French Quarter. Loved the area and will be back to stay here again. Restaurant next door, Fresh Market and the Grocery right up the street. A few blocks to Magazine St. The staff could not have been friendlier. Loved talking with all of them. After staying in the French Quarter and here, this will be my first choice from now on. Can't wait to to go back.I'm happy to hear you had such a great stay! I love the area the hotel is located in. There is plenty to do and see, while still being much quieter than the French Quarter. Let us know when you are ready to come back! It is a great time of year to sit outside on our porch and watch the streetcars go by!Kathleen Davis, Front Office Manager
1	Great Stay and Great Staff. I was here for 4 nights, and I had the best time. It was a nice location not fare from one thing or another. The front desk staff was amazing. Lynn the GM was wonderful on giving me ideas on what to see while visiting the city. Just a great stay and when I return ill be sure to stay again!Hi Kara D.It is with great pride that I am able to read so many great reviews about our staff and property.San Diego is great destination, and we really enjoy helping our guests explore what it has to offer.We are glad you took the time to share your experience, and look forward to seeing you on a future stay.* Book Direct with Us - For the Best Service, Selection, and Value! * Best Regards,Len Regan-General Manager
1	Dazzled. My wife will thank me forever. Wonderful hotel in Miami, not on the main beach strip but I would say in a better position, if what you want to do is relax and enjoy the area. The rooms were superb and we had one with a huge balcony overlooking the harbour and pool. Breakfast was just and simply amazing especially when sitting outside in the morning. Pool area well maintained and serviced by staff. There are very few amenities outside of the hotel, one has to walk for about 10 minutes to get to shops etc. Concierge services was very helpful, a big shout out to Carlos who was the most helpful concierge guy we had come across for a while, he is a mine of information about the local area. This hotel oozes luxury and very family friendly, my family of 4 was really looked after, Two small gripes, the hotel should have somewhere in the evening where a family can enjoy drinks and desserts, that is not the bar, very often we could not get a space there in the evening or felt uncomfortable to be there with kids, the other point being in room dining could be improved, the menu was a bit short for us and the kitchen was not flexible enough to tailor some dishes, for example making the pasta spicy, we ordered some rice with our chicken and it was just undercooked , it was changed immediately and we were given complimentary glasses of wine but it was too late when one is starving !
1	Great hotel. We have just finished our trip here and all was perfect for my family (we have two children of 4 and 5 years old). We chose a king suite. The king bed was really comfortable. The room is tiny but there is so much to do in San Diego that we did not have to stay in the room other than to sleep. Perfect breakfast. Perfect pool and hot tub. Clean. The only negative point is that the hotel is not really eco friendly... plastic glass, plastic utensils....Well situated (need a car).Dear Marie - Wow! What a wonderful review, we truly appreciate your business and your trust in us. I am very happy to hear that you and your family enjoyed your stay with us and also enjoyed our complimentary deluxe hot breakfast. We look forward to welcoming you back to the hotel in the near future. Take care! :)
0	Never Again!!!. I have never stayed at a hotel as dirty as this. The sheets in the windows were ripped, the drain in the shower wouldn't drain, and the mattress was as lumpy as I've ever slept on. The freeway noise was like the trucks were going through your room!
0	Disappointed. I was very disappointed with the breakfast.... Food was not good. The room did not cleaned on the first night and on the second day before checkout time - was awakening by housekeeping... When asked the front desk why the room was not cleaned the first day - was told short on help!!!! wowDear wesleym252,Thank you for taking the time to give our business the Wingate by Wyndham Atlanta Galleria feedback. I apologize for the inconvenience you experienced while staying at our Wingate hotel. I have discussed this situation with my entire management staff to ensure that it is not repeated.

Once again, we are truly sorry for any inconvenience we caused you. If there is anything else we can assist you with in the future, please don't hesitate to call. We look forward to having you as our guest in the future.Tremeil BooneFront Office ManagerWingate by Wyndham
1	Amazing location, free shuttle, generous breakfast - a real bargain!. This hotel has recently been renamed the Best Western Plus. When telling taxi drivers where you are staying, you may have to refer to it as the Windsor Inn or Sleep Inn. The confusion in names made it difficult for the airline to return a piece of lost baggage, since they didn't have the new name in their computer system. We booked our room on www.hotels.ca and got a room with 2 double beds for 49/night.I stayed here on October 18-21 to visit Universal Studios and do some shopping prior to a conference at the Orange County Convention Centre. As two female travelers, we felt safe and enjoyed the many perks of staying at this hotel. LOCATION: This hotel has a fantastic location! It's located right off I-Drive, and there is an I-Trolley stop right across the street. You can easily reach both outlet malls on the I-Trolley. There is a shuttle that takes guests to Universal Studios, SeaWorld and Disneyworld. They drop-off in the morning, and return for pick-up twice in the evening. This means that you have to stay at the park for a decent amount of time. The shuttle is quick and pain-free.BREAKFAST: The breakfasts are fantastic. It is hectic around 8:30 AM when everybody is getting ready to visit the theme-parks. This makes breakfast a rather rushed affair since there are limited tables, and it is not always desirable to sit outside because of the weather. The buffet consisted of: pancakes, bacon/sausage, eggs, pastries, oranges, and juice. Of course, all of the jam included corn syrup, as did the pancake syrup. There are whole-wheat English muffins.THEME PARK TICKETS: There is a person who sells tickets to the theme parks at a 'discount.' After talking to him, I determined that purchasing from his is not that different from purchasing online. He sells Universal Studios 2-day park-to-park passes for 130 cash, or 135 with a credit card. He also had Disneyworld tickets for 30 off, however, this only applied with a group of three or more, and this was with a special 'employee voucher,' for which you had to notify him one day in advance, and go with him to the park to purchase the tickets. From my observations of his interactions with other guests, he didn't seem particularly keen to garner business, so I would probably look around for better deals.AMENITIES: The rooms were simple, but great. They hotel is newly renovated, and each has a safe. Although the bathroom had a funky odour, I think this is more likely attributed to the smell in Orlando's tap water, rather than hotel cleanliness.STAFF: I cannot describe how wonderful the staff were. We were greeted by Derek, who directed us to our room, and provided suggestions on where to eat. We also met another staff member named Derek, who was most courteous and helpful. There was no problem stowing our luggage with the desk since we went to a theme park after checking out... however, I was rather shocked that they did not ask for any ID to make sure that we were the owners when picking up our luggage afterwards.OVERALL: A wonderful hotel, and a great way to save money, particularly with a family. There's a pool and gym, and this provides a simple and affordable, yet comfortable place to relax while in Orlando.
0	Get what you pay for. The members at desk were very nice but if your a clean freak then i wouldnt recommend staying here. maybe if all you plan on doing is getting some rest because the shower and floor isnt in great condition. I also had a brown stain on one of my pillows. sheets are a bit out dated.
0	AVOID!. This motel is dated and extremely dirty. Everything about this place makes me want to RUN away as far as possible. The carpeted floors were very dirty and were NOT vacuumed. You could see fingernail clippings and food particles, just to name a few. There was a dirty towel and someone's sock right behind the dresser--this will let you know... More
0	Vintage hotel. Had everything you needed. Just vintage decor downtown area. Needs updating. Clean. Friendly service. Beds were hard. Room smelled like Ben gay. Ok on price. We were passing through. Pool outside clean. Right next to main road.
0	Would never stay here again. The location of this hotel was great and that's why we chose to stay here. It had decent reviews when I checked. However, when we arrived, the first room they sent us to had a terrible smell so we asked to be moved to another room. They moved us down on the first floor right next to the office. We were awoken early in the morning to a huge cockroach crawling up my husband's arm! We had to check out early and rearrange the rest of our trip as well as find another hotel to stay at. We would never come back to this hotel. We were not offered a discount or anything for the inconvenience.Good Afternoon,Thank you for completing the survey regarding your recent stay at our property.On behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. I am so sorry for the issue you experienced with the bugs in the room. Here at Best Western we strive every day to provide a superior customer experience. I am sorry we werent able to do that for you. I have placed the room you stayed in temporarily out of order, and contacted our pest control experts to take care of the situation. I can assure you that this problem will be corrected.Because we value your business, we would like to provide you with a 50 discount to use towards a future stay. When youre ready to use this discount, please contact me directly and I will personally assist you with your reservation. I am confident we can change your perception of our property.

1	Graduation. Very helpful and curtious staff, they had room ready early and everything was ready neat and clean. Lobby was well decorated and clean. Shuttle service to airport is nice plus. Driver was very helpful and curtious. Thank you for the complimentary words regarding your stay at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport. We are so delighted that you loved our well-kept property, courteous associates and your clean and well-maintained accommodation. We are also happy that our shuttle service was perfect for your needs. It was our pleasure serving you, and we hope to have you back with us soon.All the Best,Debra Thompson-FrenchGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport
1	Perfect!. This hotel is absolutely perfect. From the moment I arrived, I was impressed. The staff was friendly, greeting me with a tour of the grounds, a description of the neighborhood, and escorting me to my room. The grounds and the room were lovely, exactly as advertised on the website. I stayed in the ocean view studio, which was beautiful, with a gorgeous view of the ocean. The room and the whole hotel is comfortable and relaxing and the perfect getaway.Greetings Sara T, Thank you for taking the time to review Pantai Inn. On behalf of the the team, we are all so pleased that you had a perfect stay with us. We all strive to ensure that our guests have an enjoyable experience. I am so pleased that you enjoyed your accommodations and the comfort of the Inn. A lot of thought continues to go into what we can do to ensure that your first time with us is not your last. Thank you again for choosing Pantai Inn. Mike
1	Great Place in the Garden District right on St. Charles Avenue. We spent three nights at the BW on St. Charles - a wonderful stay. The hotel is very conveniently located on St. Charles, about halfway between Tulane/Loyola and downtown New Orleans. The tram runs in front of the hotel, but we never heard a thing from our room. It is walking distance from Commander's Palace, where we had an unforgettable dinner one evening. You are right there to see all the beautiful homes of the Garden District and to visit Magazine street. The hotel itself is so accommodating. The breakfast is bountiful - hot and cold items, and lots of fresh fruit. They keep coffee, tea and fresh-fruit-flavored chilled water available all day. In the afternoon they put out warm, fresh-baked cookies. In the evening, there are grapes and cheese. All on the house! There is a decent-enough and very friendly Mexican-style restaurant and lounge attached. We ate there our first evening and cannot complain. What is nice, once again, is that the restaurant is a bit loud, but we never heard it from our room. Everything about this hotel is great. I would recommend it to any friend or family member, and would definitely stay here again.
1	Repeat Customers. I can't say enough about the Suncoast!! My brother lives in Las Vegas, so as far as the Strip - we have been there, done that. If you are a first time visitor, then by all means, stay on the Strip if you want that Classic Las Vegas vibe. But if you frequent Las Vegas and would prefer a fabulous view of the mountains in Red Rock Canyon, no traffic and great value - then consider a stay at the Suncoast. We (my husband, myself and two children) have stayed there 4 times in the past few years and my parents stay there at least three times each year when they visit. You can't beat the low room rates, and the rooms are HUGE and very nice. The hotel has a large casino, friendly staff and a very nice selection of upscale restaurants, midrange restaurants, even a hot dog stand in the casino near the sportsbook. The pool and hot tub are very nice and never crowded. There is a movie theater and bowling alley. They also have a nightclub and on several occasions, my folks have enjoyed some great concerts at a very low ticket price. They saw the Lettermen and Jay and the Americans and raved about both shows.The only downside is the distance from the Strip - which is probably a 30 minute cab ride. But you are still close to shopping across the street at Tivoli Gardens, which also has some nice restaurants. If you want to explore Red Rock Canyon, do some hiking or horseback riding, or play golf, this would be a great place to stay. We have never had a bad time at Suncoast.
0	No cooking. Unless you plan to bring dishes and all cooking utensils with you don't plan on cooking anything. They are the only extended stay hotel that I have stayed in that doesn't provide any type of cookware or utensils of any kind. Their excuse is for sanitary reasons. I personally believe they are just trying to get more money from people... More
0	Great location - poor hotel. We had stayed here before in 2012 and enjoyed it therefore we had great expectations for our return visit. We were disappointed. The staff were rude at check in and at all other times - no smiles or good mornings/afternoons were offered with one exception, James, who was really nice. The hotel itself appears outdated - there was a musty smell in the corridors and it felt unclean. Our first room was unacceptable as it was covered in dust, the carpet was really dirty, the bed sheets were pulled and tatty, and there were stains on the tiles in the bathroom (not small ones but large off-putting ones). We asked to switch rooms and while our second room was acceptable the carpet was in need of a good clean and we had no curtains - only a black out blind. We did not enjoy our second stay here - so much in fact we booked another hotel after the second night and only returned the night before heading home. We will not be staying here again, the great location does not make up for its shortcomings.Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us, we do apologize that your stay did not meet expectations and want you to know that we will take your comments into consideration as we continually strive for improvement.Rafael Ortiz-MartinezFront Office Manager
1	A Terrific Place to Stay. This hotel has it all! A great location close to the La Jolla Cove, with great ocean views. You can easily walk to local restaurants, shopping, and places of interest in La Jolla.Our room was large, quiet, and comfortable and we stayed in a studio room which is one of the smaller rooms. We had an ocean front room which included a balcony overlooking the ocean.The hotel provides a free breakfast that changes daily and is delicious. The service at breakfast is terrific. As an example the toaster was not working on the first day of our stay. The toast would not stay down unless the handle to the toaster was held down. The breakfast attendant (I can't remember his name) held down the handle for us while we prepared the rest of our breakfast. It's a small thing that shows how far the staff at this hotel will go to make your stay more enjoyable.The nightly turn down service is a nice touch as are the hand colored notes delivered to the room. The hotel provided free bottled water daily and placed a few in our fridge and when they noticed that we placed a bottle on our nightstand they also began placing a fresh bottle there along with a clean glass.As noted in other reviews the bathroom is very small, but it in no way negatively impacted our stay.Our room also had a microwave, silverware and plates, wine glasses, and a refrigerator with an ice maker.I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here again in the future. The staff and facility truly made our vacation more memorable.Greetings Nanook4530,Thank you for taking the time to review Pantai Inn. I thoroughly enjoyed all the thought and detail that you put into your review. It means a lot to me and the team when our guests share their experiences with others. With your careful descriptions of your accommodations, our location, our breakfast service, and of course all of the other wonderful touches we provide you did a remarkable job at painting a beautiful picture for readers to get a feel of what to expect when they stay here. We hope to create more memories with you in the future.Thank you again for choosing our Inn! Mike
0	Not for Business Travel. Stayed a few days while on business, big mistake. I don't want an experience from my Hotel - I want value for my money. No Closet, No dressers, No coffee maker, No Frig, No Microwave, No Bathtub, No Iron, No ice machines, No room service, No Workspace and of course no free breakfast. They give you a poker chip for one free coffee or drink. It is geared towards those who don't need any of these amenities and want to hang out in a noisy bar environment for your computer work. They give you a small tray table about 15x15 inches to work on in your room, that doesn't cut it for me. I get the revenue play with putting more rooms in a much small piece of real estate but for the nightly cost, a business traveler can find much nicer hotels in Chicago. I would suggest an improvement would be to have a fold up table on the wall and a chair at least. Traveler beware if your are on business (especially a women) this is most likely not the place for you - unless you just want tacos and the free lollypop from room service. I think the Do Not Disturb sign with the young guy in his under ware hugging a teddy bear says it all.
0	If there was a rating less then 1, I would pick that!. Do not stay at this hotel! Disgusting. Door to get in did not work, stains on carpet, rust on sink and shower area, dirt caked on moldings,shower curtain was broke making water go on floor, curtain in living room was broke. Mold on patio, phone was broke and some sort of red stuff on it, and beyond gross, certain body... More
1	Recommending to friends. Great hotel in the French Quarter. This was our first visit to New Orleans. We were welcomed by amazing jovial staff who were full of excellent suggestions for places to eat and visit. The best thing we did was leave our vehicle parked. (There is a daily cost for this.) We were able to walk to Jackson Square and explore the French quarter. What fun. Our room was clean and the air conditioning was quiet. Breakfast was plentiful and relaxing, a great way to start our day. We loved this older hotel and look forward to coming again.We are happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us on your recent trip to NOLA. Our staff takes great pride in providing friendly customer service to all of our guests.We look forward to seeing you again on your next trip to The Big Easy.
0	Unsafe and dirty. Please DO NOT book this place. As soon as I got there, I felt scared. However, I couldn't leave because I couldn't find an affordable place due to a convention going on. I thought that I would spend all day doing tourist stuff, and just come here to sleep, but it was a nightmare! There are a bunch of homeless people, drunk, high, suspicious etc around the area. I'm from a country with the highest crime in the World and I have been in many cities, but I have never felt so scared. There are trash bags in the stairs and they smell like pee. The rooms smell like weed and smoke furthermore, the smell of cleaning chemicals were worst. I didn't see bed bugs however, there were hairs in the sheets. It feels like they never changed them. The shower didn't work. I heard two men next to our bedroom having loud sex. I saw 3 transsexual men in the room downstairs in underwear. People tried to get in our room several times therefore, I put the table against the door. If you have family, don't even think about staying here.
1	Trusted Standard. We stayed at Hyatt House Seattle Downtown for two nights. It is a convenient hotel with studio style rooms. It is well located right in front of the famous Space Needle. You have to walk about 15 minutes to Pike Place and the Centre but that is still very convenient. Breakfast was included, but we did not make use of it. They do have a small bar and Happy Hour in the lobby (we did not make use of that either but saw the sign). Staff is very friendly and helpful. It is one of those places where you get exactly what you paid for and know what to expect. Good space, comfy bed, big shower and anything you need to have a comfy stay. Only thing: the elevators are ridiculously slow we stood down waiting for one car to arrive what felt like ages. And we are happy to spend our last night there as well on our way back home.
1	by a lovely lake.... This is a nice property, just by the lake union. The folks at the front desk were warm, friendly and helpful. I really liked this gentleman who would even strain his neck if there are lots of people at the reception and and peek out to say welcome back! when I return from office! Ha!There are a lots of eateries by the lake, so that's a win too.Some improvement opportunities - this is the only hotel where I found the housekeeping would just keep the bed and bath but wouldn't clear out used glasses, plates, soda cans etc. Those stuff were there on the table even after housekeeping was done.It would be great to have some variety in their room service. Especially if it rains, people opt to stay in have some food and I found the bistro options very limited.Also, the bistro staff were either very nice or made a bad impression - for instance, this one lady with a curly bobbed hair appeared very rude and made me feel like I am serving her when she came to deliver my food and in another instance, this one man appeared oh so friendly, almost too friendly and the moment I signed the receipt he was looking for the tip amount - making the whole thing feel like a forced show to get tip rather than genuine hospitality.But yea, the property is great and everything is at walkable or short driving distance. Overall 4 star experience.
0	Worst hotel around.. So my boyfriend and his friend had just moved out and had to stay at a hotel for a week before moving into to their new place. This place is moderately cheap, but there is great reasoning for that. This place is absolutely disgusting, the pool was green and not taken care of, the elevator was sketchy, it's located right off the freeway, (so don't expect a quiet nights sleep)w and the rooms smelled like death. But that wasn't even the worst part, it was the Indian managers customer service and attitude. I live in Seattle, and out of the week my boyfriend was staying there I slept over two times. The second time, it was the last day of his stay, and I was downstairs getting us breakfast (which was STALE mini bagels, and little muffins which were not that great) and the Indian manager was watching me the whole time. When I was heading back up he approached me and asked my room number, I told him and he stated only two people were checked into that room. I said my boyfriend is one of them and I've only stayed two nights and he went off how I was lying and he was going to charge them an extra 30 dollars a NIGHT. I went back up to the room and my boyfriend was still sleeping and he called our room and started yelling at him over the phone, so he went downstairs to talk it out with him. Eventually after being harassed several times the Indian man gave up. Once it was check out at 10 am, he came to our door and stood there yelling at us until we were out. Worst service I've ever had in my entire life, DO NOT GO HERE. There's a Best Western not too far on Denny that's not much more expensive and has wonderful service, better location and a more comfortable room.Thank you for taking the time to review our property. We truly value the opinions of our customers and we apologize that we did not meet your expectations. Providing our guests with the best possible hospitality and service has always been our mission. We apologize for the issues you experienced. We have addressed this issue with our team and management. We continually strive to keep our property clean, friendly, and welcoming. We want you to know that we truly enjoy sharing our passion for our destination with visitors and want you to walk out the door feeling refreshed. If you come back to our hotel I would love to have the opportunity to speak with you directly, so please ask for me. We hope to see you again in the future and wish you the very best.
1	Room Service. I stayed at the Brookshire Suites for one week and enjoyed my stayed. One thing that I was really disappointed with was the room service they did not do a good job at cleaning the room. Out of the 5 days that I stayed there, I only allowed room service to clean my room on the third day. I expected them to resupply me with all the essentials in the bathroom. I was short on towels, soap, and shower gel. I was more furious when I notice that they did not provide me with a trash bag for the room trash can. Not to mention that when I walked in on the first day of my stay, under the sink there was a bag filled with trash from the previous stay. It did not bother me at first but after noticing how awful there room service is led me to write this review.
0	Too expensive for a Stay. I've stayed at this place ever since it used to be a Clarion Hotel. I was there when they changed the elevators and there since they finally changed the carpeting in all th rooms. Ok gang sorry to say i have some problems that i now can't stand anymore. The elevators need repairing. They are so noisey. You guys have... More
1	Vintage at it's best. I love old hotels when they have been impeccably preserved like this one. The rooms are comfortable, everything works in the marble bathrooms, the staff is helpful and friendly. The new owners seem to be trying to relax a little of the stuffiness without sacrificing the elegance, and they are doing a good job. The location on Pill Hill makes it convenient for doctor visits. Be sure to ask for their medical rate. The restaurant is good, but you can also go across the street to the Corner Cafe for breakfast or lunch, or down one block to the popular Vito's for dinner.This old dame is quite a charmer! I'm glad you appreciate all the work that has gone into keeping her as beautiful as the day she opened! Yes, we're definitely about being upscale, not uptight. Glad you felt that. I'll be sure to pass along your feedback to our new management.Hope to see you again soon!Angie M. MykelGeneral ManagerHotel Sorrento
0	Bad Customer Service. I would avoid this hotel. Bad customer service. I left a device in the TV to charge and it is now gone. I called the hotel after I returned home and explained the situation and they mentioned they would get back right in touch with me. NEver happened. I emailed the manager twice and no response. So I went through Hilton to try and get a response knowing full well that the device is gone. They could not get a response from the hotel either. I was credited the amount of my stay, but unfortunately my device was worth more. Miraculously I got a call from the hotel the day after Hilton tried to contact them and after a few exchanges they said what i already knew - they could not find it.We are committed to delivering outstanding service and what you described in your review was disheartening to all of us. Please let me begin by offering my sincere apologies. We value your feedback, and if these concerns were brought to our attention and we still failed to resolve everything to your satisfaction, I am truly sorry. Please don't hesitate to contact me directly with any other concerns. We value your loyalty to the brand and will like the opportunity to serve you in the future. Thank you for staying with us and for your feedback. Kind Regards,Ralph AmaroFront Office Managerralph.amaroHilton.com
1	Good value, great service, need some tweaks. Carpets/rooms are too perfumed/scented for me. Not good for some with sensitivities to scents such as myself and for use of my CPAP machine for sleep apnea since the scent gets absorbed into my machne filters. Please consider getting a fragrence free deoderizer for carpets/rooms or at least a very lightly scented one. The overpowering scents also made me nauseated from time to time. Breakfast had a fairly good assortment, but could use a change in the egg product. The eggs taste too much like a reconstituted procseed egg product for me. The fresh toast sticks available at times were a great addition to breakfast. The front desk staff were exceptional and provided awesome friendly service. Shuttle personel also great and friendly. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone staying that has a family member at Medical City Hospital.Dear 721jeffreygu,Thank you for your kind words regarding your stay at the Hawthorn Suites Dallas Park Central. We were glad to have you as our guest, and appreciate you taking the time to comment regarding your visit with us. I have shared your recommendation regarding air freshener with our staff. Given the number of guests we have from Medical City, I completely agree is it worth looking into. We look forward to the opportunity to host you again the next time you are in the Dallas area. Thanks again for being our guest! Best regards, Charlie Westhoven Operations Manager Hawthorn Suites Dallas Park Central
0	Water stains is a no go.. It was a bad experience for me. The first room I checked into the ceilings had water stains, the shower walls were dirty and the final straw was when I pulled back the covers and what do I see, a caterpillar crawling in my bed. I was so disgusted when I saw that and when I called the front desk they told me I had to come down to switch rooms because they had one person on duty. So they put me in another room and there that had water stains in the ceiling and the toilet seat had stains on it and the room door had water stains on it. It was 1 in the morning and I was exhausted so I stayed that night but when I woke up I had bites all over my back so with that I checked out early and went to another hotel.
0	You get what you pay for.... We were flying in at midnight and looking for an inexpensive place to stay. We found it and it was close to Universal Studios our destination the next day. It is an old hotel and looks dirty, but it wasn't that bad. However, the information on another site said that they offer shuttle services to Universal - true, but not until 12 noon. We were told we could walk 15-20 minutes to get there. We had a rental so we just took it and glad we did because the walk back after all day at the park would have been horrible. We also did not have enough towels/washcloths and asked for more. We did get towels and was told they would bring the washcloths. They never arrived. When we checked out she remembered we asked and when I said we did not get them, she said they must have been busy and forgot. The ice machines were out of order and just not a place I would stay again.

1	New Hampton in Napa. Good new option for hotels in Napa. Centrally located near new retail center south of downtown Napa. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Very typical Hampton Inn room setup. Nothing special, but reasonable alternative to other hotels in the area. Dear P5041IYwilliamk,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We appreciate your feedback. There are several options for hotels in Napa and we love to provide our guest with a Hampton value of complementary internet, complementary parking, complementary breakfast, our added features of pool and spa as well as a nice patio area with a fireplace and 2 fire pits which not all Hampton's have. We thank you again for your feedback and hope to see you again on your next trip to Napa Valley. Best Regards, Serina Najar.

1	Great value for the money. This hotel was the perfect location for us. We were directly across from Disneyland and could either walk or take the bus which had a stop directly in front of the hotel. The room was large and roomy with a refrigerator and microwave. We used the hot tub several nights and could see the fireworks. We also had easy access to the Interstate to sight see in Los Angeles and Santa Monica. I would definitely stay here again.Thank you for your recent visit with us at the Best Western Plus Pavilions. We are pleased to hear you enjoyed our location and the amenities at the hotel. We hope to see you on future trips to the Anaheim area. Thank you again for your stay and review.
0	Not what I expected. I was expecting a suite considering the name of the hotel but it was really a standard room. I overlooked that as I should have paid better attention but the room was not very clean. I found a dried up contact lense in our bed, there was mildew in the tub, and the room could have used a sweeping. The other issues we had was that when we returned from dinner the front desk worker was sitting on the couches with her significant other while there were children sitting at the hotel bar. Also later my husband ran out quickly to grab something from our car and this same hotel employee did not bother to look up from her phone when he entered the hotel. Last, I went to buy a snack and a drink later that evening, the same employee was on a clearly personal phone call did not even notice I was there. I seriously could have taken the stuff left and she would not have noticed. We have a returned visit to Baltimore and I don't think we will be staying here again.
0	horrible noise. I literally stayed for a night because I was too tired to continue driving. The point of me stopping was to get sleep. I was next to a room full of kids screaming, jumping off of things and banging against the wall. I called three times to room service. All three times he came up to speak with the children. Needless to say I didn't get any rest. I called and left a message for the manager and still have yet to have heard from him. This shouldn't even get a star Please accept my personal apologies for the inconvenience you experienced with your hotel stay at our Wingate brand location. Although your experience with us has not been a good one, we hope that youwill offer us the opportunity to provide you with our hospitality on your next trip. Thank you for taking the time to let us know of this situation. We do apologize and look forward to serving you in the future.Sincerely,Willis Blake DOS

1	Perfectly Fine. We've stayed here before. We like it. It suits our needs just fine. The facility is showing some signs of wear, and the gym, at 82 degrees this morning, was a tad bit uncomfortable, but the rooms are large, clean and comfortable. I sleep pretty well there. Handsome Companion sleeps very well there (as usual). The staff is very nice and very helpful. It's not a real Starbucks, but a serves Starbucks. For real Starbucks, go next door to the big Marriott. Great location and easy access in and out of town. Dear Holly K,Thank you for staying at the Courtyard Philadelphia Downtown once again. We are glad you had a wonderful stay, loved your spacious room along with the comfortable bed and our excellent location. We hope to have the pleasure of welcoming you again whenever your travels bring you back to Philadelphia.Thank you, David Kidd Assistant General Manager
0	Overpriced and not up to Marriott standards. This place is a Marriott but I've stayed at Courtyards that were nicer than this dump. This place should be re-branded to a lower quality Marriott Property. When I see that a property is a Marriott (and not a Residence Inn, Fairfield, Courtyard, etc) I believe it is a NICE place with HIGH QUALITY standards. This property was not that.Room was okay. Nothing special. The room was overpriced by about double for the property.Breakfast was fine, the buffet is priced similarly to other Marriotts. Coffee was average.Location is near Little Italy and the Medical school. Not an awesome part of town and the property matches the neighborhood (not awesome). It's not the ghetto but there are definitely nicer looking areas in Chicago.I will not stay here next time I'm in Chicago. It may be the closest Marriott property to my client but there's plenty of public transportation in downtown Chicago, you can stay other nicer places that aren't over-priced (I recommend Blackstone Renaissance!)
0	They Have Their Own Alcohol Laws. We had a great night out on the town in Charlotte NC and head back to the hotel, go down to grab a beer from the store, and the Manager Michael tells me that this is the Bible Belt, and there are no alcohol sales after Sunday at midnight, and refused to sell me a beer out of the cooler....

0	Expensive Park and Fly. Wanted to do Park and Fly but they wanted 11 a day for Parking which we thought was very excessive. I was grossed out by the sheets, there were yellow spots on them. Room dark and dingy. People at front counter very abrupt, borderline rude. Won't be staying at this Super 8 ever again.
0	Great location, poor accommodations. I must not have read any of these negative reviews when I booked this room over a month ago. None of them are exaggerating. We drove out here 4 days before checking in to check it out. I asked to see a room but the desk person said no. I specifically requested a room that allowed us to at least... More
1	Pleasant family hotel. Very nice hotel for a fair price. Friendly staff, excellent rooms with evening cocktails and self serve hot food. A very nice self serve breakfast with ample seating. This is a family and pet friendly hotel. My stay was over a holiday weekend and there were a few sports teams staying here. If you prefer a quite relaxing stay this hotel may not be for you. Kids running in the halls, riding the elevators, and screaming in the pool but then again, that is what kids do! However this may not be the norm since schools just let out. The hotel is close to restaurants and shopping as well as movie theaters. It is right off Interstate 17 so easy off easy on.
1	Great airport hotel. The front desk had our keys ready the second we arrived. The bed was quite comfortable but could have used a couple extra pillows. The shower was a stand alone shower, which was very large. The only negative is that the van left 5 minutes earlier than stated, thus get down there at least 10 minutes prior. The internet downstair was not working the night I stayed but they assured me that it would be up in the morning, I just had to leave at 5 am, so not sure if it came up or not. For what you pay this place is a great value.
1	family trip. We stayed with my family for 1 week.It was amazing time for relax in Dubai,especially in Marriott Marquis.Restaurants food are delicious,especially we recommend Izakaya and Garden.Cafe Artois is fantastic place with very nice view to Dubai Canal.Service of concierge Mustafa was super.He advised my family all iconic places of Dubai.Definitely we will be back soonWe want to thank you for staying at the Fairfield Inn Suites by Marriott Keys Collection and we are thrilled to hear that you enjoyed your recent stay, your patronage is very important, and it means the world to us that you had a great stay.
0	Not Best Western. The rate was good, but I'd have paid more for a room that did not have patio doors whistling wind through them and a TV and remote that worked properly. Planned power outage during an entire night was acceptable and hotel did decent job of giving out flashlights and glowsticks, but did not tell us hot water would off in the morning. Restaurant did not honor breakfast vouchers toward an off the menu option even though value of breakfast buffet was listed on coupon. Excellent bed - one of the most comfortable beds I've slept on in a hotel recently. Also, great location near little Italy - lots of fun restaurants and bars.Thank you for reviewing your stay with us at Best Western Plus Bayside Inn. Please accept our apologies for any confusion about the breakfast and the TV remote difficulty. Our vouchers do not list a price or value because we give the buffet for free and specialty items from the menu are at an additional cost so we invite you to contact us directly to address your concerns. We apologize for any inconvenience caused by the cities electric company SDGE shutting the power down while they were making enhancements in the area. We are pleased you felt out bed is one of the most comfortable you have slept in and that you enjoyed the location.
1	The best kept secret in San Francisco. The Kensington Park Hotel is only a block away from Union Square which is so convenient for shopping, dining, and sightseeing activities! We always stay at the hotel because of the friendly staff, efficient service, and affordable rates. The rooms are very spacious and allows a lot for storage after a busy day of shopping. They are also clean and have good amenities that make our stay so comfortable and feels like a home away from home.We have been staying at the Kensington Park Hotel for over 15 years whenever we visit San Francisco...the best kept secret in Union Square!

We were regulars the Shawnee Motel until our last visit on 8/9/15 when Thelma Triplett called and said she was appalled that we had the room air-conditioner on 60 and I said we were hot and she responded she was hot too and for us leaving it on at 60 degrees, she was canceling our reservations for Bedford Days...

1	Absolutely Wonderful!. Our stay at the Best Western Plus Cabrillo Garden Inn was absolutely wonderful. The staff was helpful and welcoming right from check-in. The walked us through a map of San Diego including places to visit, eat, and where to walk. Our room was very clean and well presented when we walked in, and it was continued to be well kept over our week of stay. The terrace was also a wonderful place to enjoy a class of wine and conversation with friends. Overall, our stay in San Diego was great, and the staff at the Cabrillo Garden Inn made it all possible!Dear Katie S, Thank you for your kind comments regarding your stay at Best Western Plus Cabrillo Garden Inn. We are pleased to know that you enjoyed your stay at our property and that you loved the accommodation, our friendly staff and convenient location. We hope to see you again in the near future.Y ChenGeneral Manager
1	Close Comfort. I had a business trip that required me to go to the airport the night before with a 4: 30 am shuttle to the airport the next morning. I was early for my shuttle, for I was ready at 4:00 am and with no hesitation the shuttle was there and ready to take me. There have been other hotels that i would of had to wait until 4:30 am. So for that convenience and cleanliness of the room I would reccomend to nyone to stay here.Thank you for being our guest at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport. I am delighted you had a positive experience throughout the hotel and that you appreciated the convenience of our shuttle service. We value your recommendation and hope to be your hotel of choice whenever your travel brings you back to the area.Sincerely,Michael GoldwasserGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport
1	Great Stay. The hotel was perfect! Very laid back, yet professional. Everyone at the desk was friendly and helpful. How many places gladly give you quarters for the vending machines and then say if you have any problem with the machines please let us know. The pool area was immaculate. The beach access is perfect and the beach was clean. Breakfast was good and the setting was pleasant. I thought I left my glasses in the room and the hotel even called me later to let me know whether they found them. Stayed with children and they loved it. Hotel rooms were very quiet. Beds were comfortable and the linens were good quality. Could not hear neighbors. Wi-fi worked perfectly. Parking was very convenient underground. Walking to everything around easy. Loved it.Thank you for the wonderful review and compliments! We're so happy to hear you enjoyed your vacation with us, and we hope to see you again in the future!
0	Awful stay!!. I booked this room for one of my drivers and am appalled at what she reported back to me. The first room had a broken tv that wasn't even connected to the electric/cable. So as not to be blamed for the damage she requested a new room. She was given keys to another room and as she entered the room, somebody was already sleeping in it!! She apologized and went back to the front desk to request a 3rd room. She refused to go to the room without the agent going first to make sure everything was ok with it. The agent complied and came back and issued her the key. Everything seemed ok till she went in the restroom and found the toilet full of what should have flushed away! She called the front desk and reported it but nothing was done about it. This is no way to run a railroad and I won't put any of my drivers there again!!
1	cute experience. Visiting NOLA for a wedding and had a block of rooms available at Bienville House, took the opportunity due to the low rate and distance from wedding events/bourbon street area. Upon arrival was very suprised by cute street apeal and friendly reception area, after receiving our room key we ventured around the lobby area and found the pool. The pool is in the courtyard area in the middle of the building. It is very grotto like and almost had a european feel with its rustic charm yet small and charming feel. Unfortunatelly, we did not use the pool but did take advantage of the small breakfast bar the next morning in the lobby area that was just enough to get you up and going to take on the town. The room was on the top level which is actually an outdoor hallway terrace that winds around different corners offering a few views of the city. Luckily it was a warm day and we were able sit out on our own patio terrace directly outside our room. Inside the room- very clean and suprisingly large, we shared with another couple and had more than enough room for the 4 of us. The bathroom was a little outdated but it was still functional and clean (most important). Upon checkout we were greeted by a friendly receptionist who knew the city well and helped with out bags by a team of skilled bell staff. Overall- great place to stay, walking distance to anything in the bourbon street area, safe, clean, and offered a comfortable NOLA experience.
0	Don't waste your money.. So after a long drive from northern Ohio, we get to the place. Their check in is a mail box with a piece of paper in it telling you where you go. We were sent to another location where it looked nothing like the pictures online. Rooms are left unlocked so anyone can just walk in. When I walked into... More
0	no room at the inn. I would love to write a great reveiw to this Hotel, just like the majority of the other people here.However......I did not actually get to stay here. A booking was made by telephone for a 2 bed suite for New years Eve. We arrived ready to check in. Unfortunately the desk clerk was totally unhelpful. Our reservation was non existant. The clerk did not give a damn. We had travelled only a relatively short time (150 miles), but now were without accomodation on New Year. The clerk would not even help with finding an alternative. The reservation had been checked TWICE before arriving, The first time was 2 days prior, and then the night before arriving. The number we were given WAS confirmed both times on the phone, so we travelled to Anaheim without any worries. HOW WRONG WE WERE! The Reservation number that was confirmed twice has now upon arrival turned into a non existant number. There was no record of the whole transaction. After trying unsucsessfully to get any help whatsoever from the staff, we decided to give up and find an alternative. As can be expected the area was booked up, except for one place - a real roach motel. We chose to stay there (another bad choice) and had the worse night sleep ever . Thanks to Marriot the 2009 celebrations were ruined! What more can I say except - CHECK CHECK and double check, even after you receive a conformation number. Get it in writing!It looks like they had double booked and tried to fob us off . Hope this reveiw is helpful to everyone.
1	Fantastic Beach Front Hotel. We got very lucky to find this wonderful hotel. The location is perfect, the rooms are spacious and clean, the staff is friendly and helpful, the breakfast is good! The hotel is moderately priced for the location and offers parking, a nice pool, walking distance to excellent restaurants (World Famous, Green Flash), and short walk to beach and walking path. Some people complained about noise from the Firehouse Bar, but treat yourself to an ocean view or partial view and you won't have to worry about noise. As you can tell, I really liked this hotel and hope to visit again someday!Thanks for leaving such a nice review! We are happy to hear you enjoyed your stay with us and all of our amenities , and found our staff members helpful and resourceful. We hope to have you back soon! Thanks for staying at the Ocean Park Inn.
0	Nothing around.. A little hard to get to, nothing in the immediate area - like within walking distance. A little old and outdated looking.
0	i was cheated out of my room. I was kicked out just 2 hours into my stay even though I paid full price thanks to the front desk people who gave out my information to an unknown third party. my safety and security was violated. I also saw cockroaches and bugs crawling all over the place. it was nasty.
0	Slow internet Poor Curtains. We stay at LaQuinta's regularly. This one fell below the others in three areas. The desk staff did not seem to be really up on things, the internet was extremely slow and disconnected frequently, and the blackout curtains were inefficient and couldn't compete with a light that was right outside our window.
1	Simply the Best. My wife and I travelled to NYC to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary and we booked into The Ritz Carlton. From the moment the doorman opened our car door and welcomed us to our departure nothing was too much for this hotel and its amazing staff. Everyone was intent on making our stay the best it could possibly be. A nice touch, on checking in I let slip it was our anniversary when we were handed our complimentary cocktail cards (v nice touch) to welcome us. The extremely personable reception lady (from Czech Republic) must have made a mental note, because on the evening of our anniversary we were sent champagne and chocolates.The Ritz Carlton is a super luxurious hotel but at a human scale and we could find no fault at all during our stay. It was amazing to go to sleep and wake overlooking Central Park.Thanks everyone! We will be back!
1	DC weekend. My fiance and I stayed here to go the Nationals games Friday and Saturday nights. The hotel is very close to the metro and made it easy to get to the ballpark and the zoo. The free champagne was a nice touch to start our trip. Only negative is that if you use the wifi and are not a Rita Carlton rewards member they charge you 9.95 per day. I asked about this charge and they promptly refunded it since we were only using it to check emails on our phones and could have used our data had we known it was that expensive. Otherwise a very nice hotel with excellent staff that make your experience enjoyable.
0	San Diego Business Trip. I have come to except a certain level of Respect and Professionalism with Best Western Properties, but this one falls below the mark, they have no respect for their Diamond Level customers, the food at the Restaurant is over Priced for what you receive. There is no free or Discounted Breakfast, and no real incentive to eat Lunch or Dinner on property. the Internet works great, Beautiful Property and Housekeeping staff are very nice and courteous.Thank you for the review regarding your recent stay. We are delighted to hear you enjoyed our beautiful property and our nice and courteous housekeeping staff. Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you gave us to implement improvements to ensure we offer a better experience for guests in the future. Best Western member properties which do not have on-site full service restaurants are required to provide a complimentary breakfast buffet on-site. Although, we do not offer a complimentary breakfast, our on-site restaurant, Seven Seas Caf, is open from 6am-10pm serving breakfast, lunch, and dinner for our guests convenience. For our hotel guests, we do offer a 15 off on lunch and dinner in our cafe. We hope that you will consider staying with us again so that we can have another chance to provide you with an excellent experience.
0	Poor Quality. This hotel is not up to my standards. The heating/cooling system was extremely loud and woke me up several times during the night. The hotel reception desk clerk was not helpful at all. The quality of food items for the breakfast buffet were very limited and not very good.
1	Relaxing. The service was great. I was there for the weekend to get away. This is my second time staying there. I love the spilt rooms. I would reccomend this hotel to all my friends. I live in San Diego and I choose them because of the service and its very quite.Dear GuestIt is nice to know that you enjoy our two room suite evry time you visit us which always is a great value along with the quiet rooms, great location and complementary hot breakfast buffet.

0	Don't stay here for business.... You'll never get to sleep. The only advantage of the continuously loud, throbbing dance music is that it drowns out the traffic noise from the street. I, too, was suckered by the glowing reviews, but in reality, this is a refurbished motel that has cleverly marketed itself as a hip destination spot. It's located in a nondescript area of town, and the furnishings are Ikea-quality generic modern. The pool is small and filled with plastic balls, making it all but unusable. The attraction of this place seems to be the bar, which unfortunately is in an open courtyard, which means you get to hear the music all night, whether you want to or not. The crowd is young, as is the staff. If you are, too, and are on vacation, you might like this place. But don't stay here for business.
1	Great location. Found hotel on Priceline. Close to Reading Market and convention center and Chinatown. Small but grand lobby. Rooms comfortable. Has Starbucks and restaurant bar in hotel. Decor is retro chic Security is good (need room key just to use elevator). Wifi is free.Tip: 15 for a glass of wine that costs 9 bottle is rediculous. Lots of bars within a 1 block walk. Tip 2: parking is 44 per night. Might want to take train in (several stops nearby).Thank you for being our guest at the Courtyard Philadelphia Downtown. We are glad you liked our convenient location which was perfect for your needs and that you were impressed with your comfortable room. Thanks again for being our valued guest, we hope to be of service to you again soon! Thank you, David KiddAssistant General Manager
1	Haven from hospital stress. My sister I stayed at the Del Mar Hampton Inn using Hilton Honors points when my husband had surgery last week. We were worn out so were pleased at the ease of checked in helpful recommendations for places to eat. Our room was small, but had everything we needed was comfortable very clean. Our breakfast was a treat from hospital food. They were very gracious about assuring us a full refund of unused points when we checked out 2 days early due to my husband's early release from the hospital. It was a great experience during a stressful time.
1	Westin, best Inn. The space and amenities are great. Most staff friendly and helpful. Good food and drink. Room was clean and quiet. However ... I saw the same clump of hair on the pool deck two days in a row. We also waited for the hotel shuttle for over an hour at the airport, and it never showed, so we had to take a cab. The front desk staff made it up to us when we arrived though. Give it a try.283pamelag - Thank you for your feedback on Trip Advisor, I have shared your feedback with the team and apologize for the missed opportunities with the pool and shuttle. I am however delighted to hear the front office turned the experience around for you.We hope you will come back and stay with us again, should your travels bring you to San Diego. Be Well, Alyssa Turowski, General Manager
1	Typical W hotel. The same feel and vibe of other W hotels though lighting in room was better than others I have been in. Love the Bliss products. Didn't try the bar or restaurant this time but have in the past. Was decent.Hello Debra R, thank you for your review of your recent stay at W Seattle. We are so pleased that you enjoyed your stay. Our team works hard at making sure our guests have a great experience here, so all feedback is incredibly important to us. Thanks again and we hope to welcome you back next time you are in the city.
0	Nasty Ants!!!. I was very uncomfortable after seeing ants in my room and the tub acrylic was chipping away... This stay was not sanitary!!! We moved to another room but my comfort level was gone!!! I just felt dirty!!! I expected a better stay for the price I paid.
0	Weekend getaway!. Union organizers with megaphone reading union laws at 7 am! Due to the layout of the hotel it is amplified tenfold. Apparently there are no noise violations for doing this. Won't be back to Santa Monica better places to go that have better ordinances. Police just drive by like there is nothing going on.
1	I had a nice stay. Check in: employee was very pleasant . Check in process took long, although the front desk did the best she could. The issue was that she was all by herself and so many people were checking in.Rooms: excellent,clean and spacious. Bed was very comfortable. Amenities were excellent as well. I wish bathroom had better privacy and ventilation.Location : fantastic, close to all attractions.Restaurant : I didnot try, so I don't know.Overall: nice experience , will be back.Happy to hear your enjoyed your stay overall and will be back we look forward to it!! Sorry about the delay getting you checked in, while we do our best to schedule according to our needs we occasionally run into unexpected busy periods. We will be sure to keep that under our radar.See you again soon,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations
0	Very Disappointed. We travel for baseball and were given a team rate offer at this hotel lower than other locations. We were told it had been remodeled and they added a new water slide so we decided to give it a try. When we pulled up to the Hotel and Convention Center the first thing we noticed was the overgrown landscape, a... More
1	Still My Favourite. I will combine 2 stays into one review. My family I stayed at the OPI in an Ocean front room and 2 weeks later my 3 year old son and I came back for a dudes week together. The hotel continues to live up to expectations in every way and I think we have now stayed here 5 times with each one being a great experience.The location is amazing and the views from the OF rooms are awesome. The pool area is great for the kids to play in, the continental breakfast is good and the recently updated bathrooms are a nice touch. But the real reason we keep coming back is the staff and how were are made to feel like home here. The staff (especially Benny these two stays) are so helpful and pleasant that it feels like we are coming home each time we check in and that attitude helps the relaxation start when we walk into the lobby. I would write more but now I am going to check their availability for a return visit....Thank you so much for your wonderful recognition of our amenities and service! It is our pleasure to continue welcoming you back and we are so glad to be your second home here at The Ocean Park Inn!
1	Close enough to the beach and Shoppings. My stay was good. I recommended the hotel to a friend because we were vacationing together. Her room had a strong smell and we were told it was coming from the pipes under the kitchenette sink. After complaining she was moved. She was offered several other rooms but they were dirty. The carpet and bathrooms look horrible. After she was shown several, (about 10 rooms) she settle on the cleanest she could find. I know you're a franchise, but when you using the Marriott name the hotel should be cleaner. Need another toaster. Only one toaster for the entire hotel. My eggs were cold before my bagel/bread was toasted. I was my second time there. I would stay there again. Hope I will never have the same problems as my girlfriend.
0	not good for a family needs. Not good, suppose to be there a freg. and microwave but I suffered and I have two kids.
0	Customer Service. We checked into the hotel and the male front desk staff member didn't greet us, barely talked to us and then didn't arrange our wake up call the following morning which was early, 5am. Thank God we set our own alarms for back-up, no phone rang. Terrible service, terrible social skills.
0	Thought it would be better. Picked the Ritz for an upscale experience. The thing lacking was the room service. Just could not get items refreshed. I'm surprised we had to keep asking. Especially for the price we paid. Otherwise, stay was good. Pretty average experience for a the Ritz. Definitely...MoreThank you for your feedback. I certainly would like to apologize for your experience and I will follow up with our Housekeeping Team in regards to keeping guest room supplies/amenities well stocked and replenished.
0	DO NOT STAY HERE!!. This is the worst hotel I have EVER stayed in!!! The price was good, but a little too good to be true. They charge you not only for your stay but also a resort fee and if your room is not ready by the time you get there and you'd like to leave your luggage, they also charge you for that! The pictures on the website are extremely deceiving. The outside looks nice but the closer you get you can tell just from the outside of the building that your in for a trip. The staff was not that nice, rude actually. When my boyfriend and I had gone back to the lobby, the lady told me to hold on a second so she could finish her text messaging.......The room was disgusting. Neither of us could walk around without anything on our feet. The bathroom had a ton of cracks and was also 4 different colors. The shower did not drain well at all and when you close the bathroom door, the crack was so big between the door frame and the door, I could see the other room perfectly. The only reason why we continued our stay here was because every hotel was booked around us. We weren't in the room for a half hour yet and we were both on the phone trying to find another hotel.The pool was terrible, no lighting around it what so ever at night. Another guest had to switch their room 4 times due to the air conditioners not working in any of those rooms. Also, pizza flyers were VERY ANNOYING!!! 2am and you hear someone at your door, sounding like trying to break in, but just sliding the flyers under the door.DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0	Stay Away. I was traveling in February 2015, was tired and stopped at this terrible place. The front desk lady was very kind and quite understanding when I requested my money back. The room was full of roaches, E V E R Y W H E R E! Left running, kept driving.
1	Seattle. Room ok ( we had queen suite) bathroom very small. Restaurant poor. Staff friendly and tried to please.Hitel well suited for my needs as near the conference centre. Hotel shuttle bus fabulous ,drives 1 mile radius around the hotel, so very convenient and easy to get to shops and restaurants.Dear EvelynK,Thank you for taking time out of your to complete a TripAdvisor review regarding your recent stay at our hotel. Please know that your feedback is extremely valuable to us and we will utilize your response to make every guest experience the best it can be. I am glad to hear that you found our location to be great and our staff to be friendly! I greatly appreciate your 4 star review. If I can be of any assistance to you, please contact me directly. We appreciate your business! Sincerely,Jonathan
1	IMPECCABLE service!. I have never been so impressed with the customer service of a hotel. Every single staff member went above-and-beyond to make us feel like we were the most important guests in the hotel. I have traveled all over the world, and have never been more impressed with the level of hospitality provided at the St. Regis in NYC.Dear Julie D, A complimentary review such as yours is always welcomed. Thank you for taking the time to post your comments on TripAdvisor. I sincerely look forward to welcoming you back to The St. Regis Hotel New York in the not-so-distant future.Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager
0	OMG, be careful!. This place was a last minute internet booking, we flew back home the next day, will never happen again. The bed sheets seemed used already, there were nasty staines on the side of the matress that was not covered. The towels had a bad, dirty smell to them, need I say more... We stayed out for dinner late so the night would be shorter, and slept with our entire clothes on so our skin would not touch the sheets. Do not go there, this place is really, really bad!
0	DO NOT stay here!!!!!!!!!!!. After getting the bait and switch I decided I'd rather stay anywhere else. I'm sure I wasnt missing much as it looks like project style crack house apartments. The front desk (old middle eastern lady) was extremely rude and up charged me 50 when I got there! I travel and stay in hotels 250 days/ year and trust me this... More
0	Dated Hotel,. The room was clean and comfortable but the hotel halls etc. were messy and looked liked they werent cleaned on a regular basis. The breakfast was a joke. Three types of sugary cereal, no toast or yogurt.
0	Will never stay in this hotel. Totally worn towels with a blackish appearance, there was a bunch of hair in the bath-tub that wouldn't drain. Carpets in bad condition, dirty walls, only hot water from the sink, it was hard to get cold water from it. Carpets in bad conditions, only one elevator. Not a good relationship Price/benefit. My best advise is to avoid this hotelThank you for taking the time to share your experience about your recent stay at our hotel. You are among our most valued guests. We sincerely appreciate your feedback and we're very sorry you were unhappy. We will take your comments under consideration as we continually work to improve our guest experience.

1	Beautiful stay in Seattle. Stayed in a King room with a pullout sofa for teen daughter. Shower pressure was great and room had a fridge. Had a lovely view of the lake and enjoyed watching the Kenmore float planes take off and land. The staff is excellent at this location. The bartender made some excellent recommendations for dinner. Ask for a coffee cup at the desk as they have complimentary Starbucks in the little market. Prices are expensive for a Courtyard but Seattle is an expensive town.Hello handwesh,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback regarding your recent stay at the Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union hotel. I am pleased to hear that you and your daughter had a memorable and positive experience during your stay. Should your travels bring you back to Seattle, we hope to have another opportunity to serve you. Sincerely,Dan PhamGuest Service Representative
1	Adorable boutique hotel in the heart of the city!. My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Rex for our honeymoon and recently returned to celebrate our 10th anniversary! This adorable boutique hotel was even more lovely and inviting than I remembered it. The location is so convenient, and we looked forward to returning to the Library Bar every night for our complimentary glass of wine. The staff is extremely friendly, and they can offer lots of good recommendations for dining, sightseeing, etc. I cannot imagine going to San Francisco and staying anywhere else.Dear Amy S,Thank you so much for taking the time to complete a review on Tripadvisor about your stay at the Hotel Rex. As General Manager of the Hotel Rex Im very pleased with your positive feedback. I will make sure to share your comments with the entire staff. Receiving reviews like yours is of immense value and really what we are striving to accomplish each day. Again, thank you for your comments. I look forward to welcoming you back when you travel to San Francisco again.Kindest regards, Lorenz MaurerGeneral Manager Tel. 415 217 4023lmaurerjdvhotels.com
1	Nice hotel - close to attractions in D.C.. I thought the hotel was very nice. The staff was wonderful! They were very helpful and friendly. Only thing I did not like was the hotel allowed smoking out in front of the main entrance. It is fine with me if people choose to smoke, but when you are waiting for a shuttle and have about 6 or more people standing around you smoking it is a little uncomfortable for those who do not smoke. The only other thing that I did not like was one day when we were on the shuttle there was a young women already on when we got on. I am not sure if she was an employee of the hotel but it was clear she was not a hotel guest. I do not know your rules on people riding your shuttle but here is what the problem was this women took up 2 seats - the shuttle was full and people, guest of the hotel, had to stand. If she was not a guest of the hotel (which from her conversation with the driver I am guessing she was not) the drive should of had her stand so that people who paid to stay at the hotel could be seated. If she was an employee of the hotel she needed to move over to allow a guest to sit with her and not take up two seats. That was a little disappointing but that being said the shuttle service was great. Right on time every day you have to love that! It was my son's first time to D.C. thank you for making it a great trip.
0	Was ok just ok. Pool was closed to early 9p.m. It was hot wanted to cool down.
0	COCKROACHES. The guy was nice.. The room was dirty food left in the fridge. and at night ROACHES all over slept with the lights to try to keep them hidden.......... Lesson learned.. Unless you like sleeping with BUGS I would not recommend this place
1	Weekend Bargain. This hotel would fit right into the downtown of any major city. But, here it is in the suburbs! Obviously, it caters to business travelers during the week. But on the weekends, it caters to people like me!Why was I here A long weekend getaway with my wife. Specifically, two days of bicycle riding on the fabulous nearby Silver Comet trail. We needed some level of luxury, walking distance to decent restaurants, and a safe place to park with our bicycles still strapped to the car. The Waverly ticked all the boxes. It didn't hurt that the weekend rate was a downright bargain.Our room looked to be newly renovated and very clean. The bath was clean, too, but it had some wear showing. Like maybe it hadn't been renovated at the same time as the room.The linens were very nice, though the pillows were disappointing. Also, the mattress didn't feel like the same quality that a hotel of this level typically has. TV was good and the A/C worked well. Housekeeping was super. Surprised that there was no safe in the room, this being a business hotel.Breakfast was included in our room rate. Buffet, of course, but the food was good and it had everything we needed. But it was just breakfast. Nothing fancy. The normal price for the buffet is 18. While I know that is typical for this level of hotel, it's just really pretty expensive compared to what is available around the corner.Okay, now, a couple of things that I don't understand... The first is why does the hotel charge north of 15 a day/night for valet parking when self-service parking is free and convenient Seems weird to me, but I'm sure they know what they are doing. The other is (and it's an industry trend not unique to this hotel) why do hotels now put those heavy duvets on the bed It's too much except in the dead of winter. One is either too hot with it on or too cold with it off the bed. These things just encourage guests to run the A/C down to a low temperature to make sleeping comfortable. Okay, put the duvet on the bed, but supply a light blanket as a comfort alternative and energy saver to boot.To close this review, let me say that the best thing about this hotel is the staff. Everyone we interacted with was just fabulous. In particular, Amira at the front desk went out of her way with an unexpected kindness. While checking our reservation, she must have overheard me say something quietly to my wife about her birthday. 30 minutes after we got to our room, a bottle of really good bubbly and a plate of chocolate covered strawberries was delivered. Perfect and so unexpected. Just wow!I am glad you were able to spend a couple days with us at the Waverly! I share your interest in bike riding and love the Silver Commet trail, such a beautiful place to ride. I appreciate your comments and critique very much, it helps us make adjustments to continue to improve! Hope to see you back with us soon.
0	Disappointed. We were through Prosser in Feb, and decided to try Barn Motor Inn, an independent instead of the well known chain. Mistake. The place was empty, and, I found out, for good reason. Light coverings with no extra blankets on beds. No thermostat, just a very loud heater/cooler with high/low type settings. No hair dryer (are you kidding me.. I... More
1	Hidden Gem, dont tell anyone though... This was my first stay at this hotel and with the Larkspur brand of hotels. I have been to San Fran a countless number of times and have always stayed in Union Square at other hotels (Hotel Nikko, Kimpton, etc). I must say that this hotel was very nice. It wasnt a large hotel (4 floors) but it was perfect and allowed for a better guest experience in my opinion. The rooms were nicely appointed and extremely clean, very modern. They are on the tight side but that is normal for SF, so no big deal. The staff at this hotel were probably some of the best I have encountered in a while. They were genuinely nice and allowed us to check in 4 hrs early. They were also quick to ask us if we needed help finding restaurants etc. Location is great, 1 block from the BART station, great if you are arriving from SFO, or OAK. Cable car is also right down the street. Area was safe at all hours of the day, except for occasional panhandler but that is normal in every big city.Suggestions for guests would be to ask for an interior courtyard room as the exterior rooms face a nightclub and it can be noisy. If not ear plugs are readily available at the front desk.Overall this hotel is tops and I would stay here again if I am back in the city.
1	Convenient for DCA and short stay. I stayed over cuz I had a work event on the same night as the Cubs being in the World Series and didn't want to drive back home. Worked for what I needed but word of the wise it's closer to Alexandria vs DC proper so plan accordingly. But staff was very helpful. I booked very last minute on hotels.com for a king bed but got two doubles which was a bit frustrating as I was a solo person but getting back from watching the game at 2am, I didn't really care enough to call down (I had only dropped my bags off in the room upon checking in and immediately walked out of the room).
0	Location is convenient - but only the Adam's family should stay here. Don't. do. it. This place is pretty crummy, really loud, all the walls are dark gray, the hallways are built for midgets, the floors slope, the furniture is too crudy even for Ikea - no chairs except these metal things that are not comfortable, the lights are about 20watts, the bathroom walls are those sheets of plastic made to look like tile....there is a Starbucks downstairs - yay - but does not make up for Uncle Fester, Lurch and Morticia who obviously were consulted on the decor and layout. Oh and to add insult to injury - they charge you 19 a day for .... not sure internetDear Tammy T,Im so sorry to hear your stay with us was not as pleasant as you would have expected. Please accept my sincere apology. I hope you will give Hotel Diva another chance on your next visit to SF. We hope to see you soon.Warm regards,Virgil LopezHotel Manager
0	Good Location, decent hotel but they ripped me off. We were looking for a place to stay in San Francisco for the family (3 kids) and found Royal Pacific Motor Inn on hotels.com. I compared the price at hotels.com with the price if I were to book directly at the hotel on their own web-site. The price was almost the same (156 USD + tax, total 186 USD incl. tax), but I made the booking through hotels.com because there it was clear that we could stay 5 people in the room (often there is a limit of four persons which makes it a bit difficult if you have three children). At check out time they wanted to charge me 215 USD per night incl tax, that is almost 30 USD extra per night. They refused to acknowledge that my price was given including tax. So they have charged me two times for the tax.This is a kind of discussion you don't want to end up with during a vacation so make sure you have a correct quote if staying here. Otherwise the hotel was OK.
0	Very dissatisfied. We had stayed in the past and were very happy with the service, restaurant , overall experience, thus when we came back to Deadwood at the end of November, 2015 we wanted to stay there again. Huge mistake! Our room was freezing cold (59 degrees) when we checked in. We were told it would warm up a degree or two... More
0	Eh... go find something a bit better!. I may be biased since we stayed here right after a trip staying on Disney property but trust me, you can find something better for not much more. The air conditioner was all cracked, hair and stains on the SHEETS (EW!).. it was just.. bad! My husband and I laughed it off but it did suck.
1	Great experience!. Initially, I was a bit apprehensive because of the price of the parking and the lack of photos of the front and street view of the hotel. But I was very relieved by the parking garage around the corner of the hotel which costed 14.00 versus 42.00 for hotel valet parking. I was pleased with the location of the hotel as it was very conveniently located near a great restaurant (Nandos), a 24 hour CVS and a Whole Foods market. The staff at the hotel were very friendly from the moment we approached the outside of the hotel to the front desk, life guard at the pool and servers during the free breakfast. Great experience!
1	Updated motel. This motel has come a long way in the last year. With new management it has been updated extensively. A few more things need to be done, but the pool area is now great - new matresses - new air conditioning units - new lamps-- just a real step in the right direction!Dear Robert PI thank you genuinely for the kind words and for staying at my Best Western Inn Suites.We are continuing updating our product with new ice machines coming, finishing up the 2nd floor with a new light package, mattress, new coffee makers, refurshing our room furniture, future coming new carpet, new sofa beds, renovating the lobby. etc.
1	Nice hotel, good service-- problem with Private events. As per previous reviews, we also encountered closure of the outdoor bar for a private event. We only stayed at the hotel for 2 nights and primarily chose this hotel because of this amenity. The rates are not cheap, and it is quite disappointing to be turned away to go sit in a downstairs restaurant bar instead. The rooms are nice, clean--beds are a bit firm for my taste. Enjoyed the complimentary wine in the evening. Breakfast was good when we used the facility. the location can't be beat...close to bars and restaurants, and the bay walk. Valet parking is 40 a day...pretty high. would recommend hotel once they get the private event closures under control..Dear Susan S.Thanks for your feedback about your recent stay with us. I'm very happy to hear your kind words about our facility and the location certainly can't be beat! I did want to acknowledge your frustration about the event being held at our deck. As you can imagine, it's quite a popular space. Due to its large size we're normally able to section off part of it for private events so that all of our guests can enjoy the area. I appreciate the feedback about what you encountered and want to apologize. We'll make sure that we're cognizant about the best use of the area. Thanks again and I hope you can make it back soon.

1	Sleep, Shower, Work. When travelling for business, the thing you care most about is getting some sleep, being able to effectively work and having a functional room that takes all the friction and noise out of your day. The St Regis delivered in spades. Nothing too much trouble for the staff and excellent service on every interaction. Dear Meek4,Thank you for taking the time to share a review on your recent visit to The St. Regis San Francisco. We look forward to welcoming you back to the hotel for future visits and will share your kind mentions with our team. Sincerely,Andre BroseHotel Manager
0	Very loud and Unsecured. Hotel was filled with loud softball teams who ran up and down the hotel hallways until 1:30 am. Also, check your door when you leave your room. Our door did not shut completely and the outside exterior doors remained unlocked 24/7. This hotel needs better security.
1	The small-feel comfortable-manageable-greatly located - hotel. Perfect location. I would clearly stay there again. No doubt.A little bit expensive given the category of the services.The breakfast is very much complimentary...Very warm personnel, except for the lady that attends the breakfast.The younger staff in the front desk appear to be not too informed about local tourism details.Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your feedback! You'll be happy to know that we are continuously training our newest staff members not only on hotel procedures, but local tourism details as well - by your next stay, they'll have it down! Thanks again, we look forward to seeing you again.
0	Wouldn't honor our reservation - steer clear. I booked a guest for this hotel in October and had a hotel confirmation number - didn't matter - when our guest showed up in January, they told him he had been bumped because another guest was extending their stay at a higher rate. Left our guest high and dry to find accommodations elsewhere last minute. Luckily the Doubletree hotel was willing to match the price for us! Never had this happen before - seems extremely unethical.I apologize but I'm not sure of the complete details so I have send you a separate message so that I can investigate the situation and address your concerns.From your description this is not our normal procedures. Thank you for bringing this to my attention and I apologize if this was the communication you recieved regarding a reservation. Thank you for your patience and I will follow up with you once you are able to respond to my separate message.
1	A great economy hotel with mid-range facilities. Visited NOLA with a group of girl scouts and their parents. This hotel was a great base for our large group of 20+. The free breakfast, popcorn and drinks, and kick back made our trip even more economical. Free shuttle to the Mardi Gras museum from the hotel. Great outdoor pool the girls loved to splash around in after a long day of sight seeing. The elevators require roomkeys to access, which is an added security feature we appreciated. Excellent location from which to explore the French Quarter, catch a tram, and head out and about. Also, walking distance from the Amtrak station.
0	Rather old and noises. It was fine for staying near the airport and being able to park the car. Rooms are tired. Floors creak and because it is an airport hotel, luggage wheels roll at all hours. Breakfast was okay. Location is good, near nice restaurants. Airport shuttle was timely and drivers were friendly. The entrance was nice. Just tired rooms and noises luggage... More
0	Restaurant was horrible experience on Mother's Day. 3 hours for bad meal and service. Sad to say we took my sister in law and her family there on Mother's day and got the worst service in history. We got in and told to sit in a corner, and obliged. It tookthirty minutes before the server to bring water with no menus. Then when asked it took her another 15 minutes to retrieve those. After...

1	Great location, friendly service. My husband and I just returned home after staying here for 7 nights. We stayed in a king size room which was nice and spacious, clean and the bed was very comfortable. We also had a small fridge and microwave. We stayed on the 6th floor which was pretty quiet. The reception staff are very warm and welcoming, and there is free tea/coffee/chilled water/pineapple iced tea in the lobby 24/7. The housekeeping staff are also very friendly, always saying 'Aloha' when you cross their paths. The location is FANTASTIC, with the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Centre at the end of the street and restaurants/cafes all within a few minutes walking distance. The new cafe that has opened up next door called 'Heavenly Cafe' is a good spot for breakfast. Try the pulled pork with eggs.......TO DIE FOR!!! Thanks to all the staff at The Shoreline for a wonderful stay.......made my birthday very memorable.Aloha statsmarty, Thank you for choosing our hotel to celebrate your birthday. We are glad to see that our great location and friendly service was able to make a memorable experience. Each of our staff members excel in showing our guests the Aloha Spirit unknown to those not from Hawaii. Please share your experience with your friends and family and tell them of the great things the Shoreline Hotel Waikiki has to offer. We hope to see you again happy holidays.Mahalo,Jerome YapchingAssistant Front Office Manager
1	Another great stay in New Orleans. I was in town for the Crescent City Classic. The Whitney Hotel is easy walking distance to the start of the 10K race. Also close to the French Quarter and the WWII museum. I like the Central Business District and this location is very central for my purposes, with St. Charles street car close by to the Quarter and the Garden District. Very good value compared to comparable hotels. I have stayed here twice before and will try to stay here again my next trip. Was a good hotel for me.We're so happy to have loyal guests such as yourself coming back again and again to the Whitney Hotel! Thank you for your continued patronage and the wonderful review. We look forward to seeing you again soon!Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager

1	Comfortable Airport Hotel. This is a comfortable hotel near the airport with a shuttle service. The staff were friendly and there is an adequate buffet breakfast. A good choice for an overnight stay between flights from the airportWow - Harold, thank you for making the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport a part of your travel plans. We are delighted to know our location close to the airport was convenient for your needs and that you were impressed with our complimentary breakfast offerings. It was a pleasure hosting you, and we look forward to welcoming you again soon.Sincerely,Michael GoldwasserGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport
1	One night stop over. Just a quick one night stop over for our family. But the beds were very comfortable, and the hotel in general felt recently renovated and nice. The staff was very friendly. There was more noise than I'm used to at hotels from people walking around in the room above us and people slamming the doors in the hallway early in the morning. Some minor things that didn't bother us in this one night stayover, but maybe in a longer stay, we were missing a microwave in our room and either a large picture or mirror on the wall as there were metal picture hanging brackets and nothing on them.
1	Convenient times ten!. This hotel is a great value if you're looking for somewhere to stay near Union Square without breaking the bank. It's a quick walk to the Square, 10-15 minutes to Chinatown or Market Street, and another 25-30 minutes to the Piers. The rooms were comfortable and well furnished. The lobby also provided ice water and tea 24 hours a day, which is a nice touch when you're coming in from a day of sightseeing and need a quick refreshment.The complaints I had:1. The valet service took longer than expected - expect about 30 minutes for your car to arrive from when you request it.2. We stayed in a room that was directly adjacent to another room, and the doors can slam quite loudly. Late at night/early morning this was a disturbance.
0	Below expectation. I canceled the stay after checking in. The room is small and cheap. The area is noisy. No wifi, no refrigerator, no microwave, no breakfast. and The cost is over price. Some time I was wrong in booking a room, but this one is the worst of all .
0	Health department please come!. We gave this a chance. First appearance... Off the main road right behind a gas station... Dark, dingy looking and dirty. First stop was check-in... The clerk was very nice. Second stop, stepping in our room, the stench was overwhelming ... Fortunately I brought Febreze, that saved us. Carpet terribly torn in several places, no curtains, just blinds I felt... More
1	A great place for anyone!. My husband and I stayed here with 49 other seniors with Coffee Break Tours. This was a great place. We were in room 420 overlooking the parking lot. It was a spacious room with new carpeting, lounge chair w/foot stool, desk, flat screen TV, lots of space with deep dresser. We had a microwave and refrigerator which was an added plus. There was a granite top area with a coffee maker, etc. King size bed with very comfortable bedding. It was all spotless. Nice bath with a large granite vanity, tub/shower combo was immaculate. Great lighting and a good a/c system. The breakfast area in the lobby was spacious. All the regular breakfast items available and the breakfast attendant made sure everything was cleaned up after people left the table. Jennifer was at the desk on this Sat. morning and she was a delight. Very polite, efficient, and thanked us for staying at the hotel. This was one of our better stays. Thanks for making us so comfortable.Thanks for the wonderful compliments! It sure made Jennifer happy to see she was mentioned for her customer service skills! If you're ever in the area again - come back to see us. Willis Blake DOS
1	Decent Hotel Great Location. I thought this was an above average hotel in a fantastic location.Room: Modern, clean, very comfortable and quiet rooms. They are slightly small but this is typical for hotels I have stayed in in SF. The discreet in-room recycling bins were a nice touch.Hotel Facilities: Not much. There is a very small fitness room and 'business centre'. We didn't use the restaurant - there are excellent dinning options very near by. The staff were helpful. Location: Great location near Union Square and Chinatown. SF is a very easy city to explore - tip: buy a MUNI pass and use it hop on and off the regular busses and the cable cars, too!
1	this is a no frills efficient motel. If you're looking for a motel to spend a night at cheap it is a fairly good deal. The room was clean, but it had a slight order. Tthe bed covering had some burn holes and tears. The eating area is somewhat small and breakfast selection was very basic. The bottom line: If this is a stop off on the way from point A to point B and you want to save some money for your vacation you might give it a try. If you are real particular about where you stay, then you might want to try another motel. considering the money I saved and service I received, I would stay there again
0	Noisy hotel. I stayed at the hotel three nights. I was very disappointed by the level of noise at night. The doors were EXTREMLY loud. I could not get to sleep my second night there because I heard doors shut the entire night. I was on the 25th floor. In addition to the noise, the hotel somehow lost my reservation in their system and I had to escalate the issue all the way up to management to get it resolved. It wasn't easy. I will never stay at a Club Quarters hotel again.
1	charming hotel with perfect Old Town location. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by this Hotel. With Best Western, I only expect a place to sleep and shower. This hotel is a notch above other Best Westerns. We were helped by Dean at the front desk and he made us feel welcomed and answered all our questions. We appreciated the friendly check-in experience as we came from a hotel where front desk staff was rude and made us feel like an interruption. As a BW Gold member, we were also upgraded to a room with a nice view. The Spanish Hacienda architecture is charming and room furnishings were nice. Of course this is an older property and there is some wear and tear. You should consider staying here if you can get a rate 125. The location is perfect. You are right across the street from Mormon Battalion Historic Site and they run an awesome tour I'm not affiliated with LDS and they did not try to proselytize. There are numerous lively mexican restaurants in teh neighborhood and this was the perfect location to stay.Thank you for choosing to stay with us and your loyalty to Best Western. Your feedback is important and we really appreciate you drawing attention to the service you received from Dean while checking in. We want you (and all guests) to feel like a very important guest while you are here and that starts with warm responsive service. Thank you again for staying and please do not hesitate to contact me if there is anything I can assist you with.
1	We loved it!. You can't beat the location of this hotel. It is on a quiet street, but within walking distance to all kinds of dining, drinking and shopping. The adorable courtyard with a pool is reason enough to stay. I could have spent all afternoon enjoying it. They had a continental breakfast which we did not take advantage of, but it looked like a pretty average continental breakfast spread. In the afternoon they put out cookies and lemonade in the eating area, I thought that was a really nice touch. We had one of the interior rooms, which I enjoyed, especially after a long night out in the Quarter, it allowed me to sleep much later than I would have if the sun had been shining in. I thought it was a very nicely appointed room, and very clean. I didn't have much interaction with the staff, but everyone seemed friendly enough. I would definitely recommend Bienville House to anyone looking for a hotel in the French Quarter.Thank you so much for all of your positive feedback! We are so glad you had such a great stay and we hope to see you again soon for another awesome trip to New Orleans.
1	Prime Location Great Staff. This W is in the heart of all the action. I got a mega suite which overlooks the bay and the city and had a great leather chair to look out the window. The property is in line with most W's, hip, with upbeat energy. The only downside is there is no Bliss spa. The Trace restaurant offered a wide variety of great food. The bartenders were on point, fast, friendly and attentive. The MOD, Anthony was very kind in fixing an issue with my bill, as well as Bryan, who checked me in. Tyler, the bellman was extremely efficient with my luggage at check-in and check-out. I will definitely stay again. Breakfast was very good as well as the service. The housekeeping was on point daily and cleaned my room when I requested, which is not always the case in a lot of SPG properties. Hello Amber D, many thanks for your response on your recent stay at W Seattle. We are thrilled that you enjoyed your stay and loved the hotel. Our team works hard to make sure our guests have a great experience, and it sounds like you did! We also agree with you, we would love to have a Bliss Spa as well! We looking forward to seeing you again!
1	Standard Marriott Property. It was clean and the staff were friendly. It was the cheapest Marriott brand in the surrounding Atlanta area but as such it as not the most convenient to getting on and off I-75. That being said it was ok and we'd stay here again. The included breakfast is always a perk.I am sorry to hear that we did not exceed your expectations. We are centrally located in the Buckhead area making dining and shopping extremely accessible, however, we are a few miles from the highway. Again, please accept our apologies and we hope to see you in your future travels.
0	Not going back. There was a mix up with our room and it was not handled well at all. We returned to change clothes before dinner only to find all of our things had been packed up and were sitting behind the front desk!
1	Nice property in an iffy area. This hotel has a beautiful lobby, professional staff 5 star feel. However, the rooms are small with larger than needed furniture and bathrooms that are average. There are beautiful touches throughout the hotel, great sushi restaurant (from what we heard), but rooms their carpeting feel worn are in need of some space saving touches (like a built-in desk shelving) in order to feel really upscale. Add to that that it sits in the tenderloin district (filled with the cities homeless and drug dealers) it is definitely not a family friendly place to stay one many of you may not want to chose. We had a car, however traveled out of the city quite a bit. Otherwise, I would not plan to stay here and walk in the area, especially at night. Overall, it is a nice hotel. Room service food was way better than average the staff we encountered was the same, but you really don't see them unless you stop at the front desk or walk to the front doors. The extra fee's for everything: 16 wifi, 50+ for overnight parking, 20 gym fee 6 for in room water, made us feel like we were being milked and our agreed upon nightly rate turning into a never again experience. One positive note I'd like to add is that Starbucks is adjacent to the hotel, all you need do is open a hotel door you're there:)Hello MarrieinLove (I love your name!)-Thank you for taking the time to write a review. I will share your comments about the hotel dcor needing an update with the General Manager as we are always looking to improve and the concerns about the neighborhood and homeless issues in San Francisco with the City Manager. Tourism enjoyment is important to the city and a focus. We do have hotel security throughout and in front the hotel and cameras, so you are protected within the vicinity.We appreciate your compliments about the exceptional customer service from the staff you encountered and the food from Anzu Restaurant. Consider choosing a special package from the Hotel Nikko website which includes many of the amenities you listed and often an upgraded room choice at a discount. All the Best,Anne HudsonDon't give up on us since it seems like overall you enjoyed your stay. Consider

The bathroom had minimal water pressure and leaked all over the floor. The... More
0	Watch out for shady practices. Do NOT make a reservation with Best Western. When in the Carolinas or in Walterboro, get a coupon and save 20. I do not know if there is a high season but during our visit in early March there were clearly lots of empty rooms.
0	I was just a little disappointed.. The room was very small, to have a full and queen size bed in it. And I clean home for a living and the bath room needs really down to using a tooth brush around the tub and floor, and I took the empty toilet paper roll out to put in the new one and the dirt I saw behind that empty roll was bad I left it out so the house keeper would see the dirt and what ever else was in there. And another chair in the room would be nice, a person can only set on the bed for just a little while then the back hurts.
1	LOOK NO FURTHER. If you are not looking for a resort hotel, but looking for a hotel in a great central location, with nice, clean rooms and efficient service, look no further than the Shoreline. We had seven nights here in May 2014 and really enjoyed staying there. It is a cute little hotel, modernized and very comfortable. The bed and pillows were great and I am very fussy! We had a view of the disgusting building next door, and a tiny peep of the sea! Honestly, given the quality of the hotel, the cost, and the little time we spent in our room, it was not a big deal. Why would you pay for a resort hotel and view when it appears you can use the facilities of the pools on the beach anyway during the day. If we ever return to Waikiki, we will be staying at the Shoreline again.Aloha Megan FThank you for your 4 star review. We are thrilled knowing we exceeded your expectations and were able to provide a memorable stay. While it is true we are not a bigger resort our hotel more than makes up for it with our centralized location, complimentary amenities, and competitive room rates. Not to mention our hotel does not charge any resort fees that bigger hotels charge. While it is unfortunate that the view from your room was not to your liking our city view accommodations face the surrounding areas of where this building is placed. For your next trip please consider booking one of our partial ocean view rooms. Thank you once again for your kind words we hope to be able to accommodate you once again.Mahalo,Daniel Floren,Front Office Manager

The room, although clean, spacious and relatively bug free, (saw several roaches) was not well lit, had cracks and scratches in the walls, and was noisy. We complained about the lighting several times, and also our neighbor's squeaky door without results. Finally we just gave up, and lived with it. We checked... More
1	Elegant, clean, convenient, reasonably hip. Cute suits sneakers outfits on the staff and the front desk! Very cheerful housekeeping folks (I hope they're union /or paid well with good bennies pensions!). Very comfortable beds with heaps of pillows. A good amount of space in the bathroom and bedroom. Location is extremely convenient. They offered a choice between a room on the street and a quiet room. The quiet room was very quiet indeed.Nice quality bath supplies, although they didn't always replace stuff when I used it up. Towels definitely fluffy, and I liked the bathrobes they provided. Only weak spots were TV (few channels, not great reception) and the wireless, although free (a must in any reasonable hotel) it is spotty.
1	Friendly staff, comfortable beds, and the lounges are great for lounging. I spent 6 nights here on a business trip recently, sharing with two friends. We found the price very reasonable, and the free wi-fi was great (compared the nearby big hotel, where we had our conference). Staff were very helpful and made good restuarant recommendations. Rooms a little small, and bathroom distinctly so, but there were not enough to affect what we thought was very good value for money. It is really good having the different public (small) lounges, where we had several meetings. Starbucks downstairs were always friendly too, and some very good, low price eating spots nearby.Dear 1Jozi,Thank you for sharing your experience at Hotel Diva with Trip Advisor. I'm glad you enjoyed your stay with us. I hope you will think of us once again on your next trip to San Francisco.We look ofrward to seeing you soon!Best regards,Virgil LopezHotel Manager
0	Got 4-6 Spider bites while staying here.... I travel often to San Francisco (1-2 times a month) and while recently planning on going with my friends for a vacation I booked at Hotel Abri. Trying to save money, I found a decent deal for a hotel that had good reviews here. While not going into further detail, but noting that I had difficulty in checking-in due to housekeeping being short-staffed, there was much issue.The BIGGEST issue I had here was with getting spider bites from sleeping on the sofa bed. After showing the front desk, and after their inspection came out negative, they moved me rooms, but that was it. I still haven't heard back from a manager and was not offered any sort of compensation.I would suggest not going cheap and staying at the Parc 55 across the street.Dear Luke H.,Thank you for your time and for providing us with the details of your experience while staying with us at Hotel AbRi, I want to let you know that I am aware of the multiple interactions/communications with you regarding your check in, stay and insect bites, I want to assure you again that we have followed up with the staff and pest control teams with the same procedures as we communicated to you at the end of your stay that there was no evidence of pests in the room, after our professional vendor inspected and treated the room, we also provided you with the findings and communication. I want to again formally apologize to you and your guests for the multiple interactions and confusion regarding the check in, as our check in time is 3:00pm, however we always try to accommodate guests requests, and our goal is to exceed each one of our guests requests and expectations, but unfortunately due to the high occupancy and number of guests, we were sold out the night before and also on the day of your arrival the requests are challenging to grant as our check out time is 12 noon. Also our apologies for the confusion on your reservation made by the third party which provided you with a One deluxe room with double double beds, not a two bedroom room, as stated, our front desk team did upgrade you to one of our Urban Suites to provide you with more space and a better stay for you and your guests. I am very sorry that even with the steps we took to upgrade your room type we failed to provide you a great stay, as this situation does not reflect our Hotel AbRis core values, style or caring approach, we totally understand your point of view, but we would like to let you know that our teams are diligently working with our third party partners to resolve these type of situations, so it would not affect other guests as it affected you. However this is not an excuse for the actions or scenario you described, during your stay we really tried to provide you with all the upgraded amenities our Urban welcome provides, but as we can see we fail on the communication and we will work on getting better. I can assure you that the sequences of events you have presented are not in any way, our teams guest service standards or company goals. I want you to know our leadership and service team have followed the procedures as we are truly concern and sadden by the details of your experience, and we want to again apologize on this format as we have done for the past days during communications with you. I would like to request from you another opportunity to further discuss and try to turn this situation from a negative experience to a positive, as we value our guests feedback. Please feel free to contact me directly at 415-392-8800, we are anxious to show you the caring, casual and family atmosphere we promote in our Hotel. Thank you again for your feedback and I look forward to speaking with you. Have a great day!EJ Varela Hotel Manager
0	Stayed here around Halloweenand it was downright scary. First off, Id like to say that the staff here was friendly and accommodating. But thats about the only positive with my experience.You generally know what youre getting with a Residence Inn. Thats why I stay at them frequently. I had never experienced anything like this one before. Inside the hotel its dated and dirty. Outside the hotel room its run down and pure ghetto.Many hotels are close to a freeway or interstate. This one is no exception. The difference: its like right there, right outside my window. It was very difficult to sleep at night due to the traffic. Moreover, sirens seemed to be going off constantly. Ive attached a photo to show how close the freeway really is, and you can see an emergency vehicle with its lights and sirens blaring.I tried to go outside for a walk yesterday. Bad idea! Cop cars everywhere and the neighborhood didnt seem very safe. Im not sure what a Residence Inn is doing in this area, anyway. Seems like it needs to be torn down and built somewhere completely different.The inside of the room and the whole property are incredibly dated and dirty. Here are a few examples.See attached photo of a TV in the bedroom. Its so smallbasically the size of an average computer monitor. I havent seen a TV that small in a hotel room since the 80s.Another attached photo is of the pillow case. Looks like theres either blood or pizza sauce on it. Im not sure which one, and I probably dont want to know.Another attached photo shows just one area (the vent by the kitchen) and how dusty/dirty it is.These are just a few examples. Overall, Im very disappointed and would never even consider staying here again. The worst part is, I traveled with some co-workers who are staying at a Homewood Suites down the road. Im a Marriott guy so I went out of my way to stay here. Their hotel ended up being MUCH nicer.Dear Guest,Thank you for sharing your experience and our opportunity for improvement. I will address these areas with our team since these items should have been resolved prior to your arrival. I apologize for a less than expected guest experience.Our guest stay and experience is important to us so we will look at ways to improve our cleaning and inspection processes to that we do not cause disruption to our guest.

0	Unprepared workers. When I first walked into the hotel(at approximately 15 minutes after check-in) there were about 3 or 4 employees sitting at tables and chairs at the entrance. (This was the common area where the continental breakfast is served). Upon check in I was told there were no rooms available. The employees had not finished cleaning the rooms. I am from NJ and was in VA for the weekend. The front desk clerk asked me if I had anywhere else to go while they had the opportunity to finish cleaning the room. The check in time stated on my reservation was 3:00 p.m. Apparently, the hotel did not receive this message. Eventually, I was able to receive a room. However, I definitely will never stay at this hotel again due to the bad service received at check in and for the attitudes of some of the employees.
0	Rude unprofessional. I had stayed in this location twice before when on charity work with no real problem, Seems a new owner now Booked a months or so ahead for Fri Sat nite stay. On checking in noticed the promo for 25. gift card and inquired. Owner working desk was very rude. While he was ringing the card I asked what rate... More
0	Absolute Nightmare!. This place is the worst ever!! First of all, we had to pay for our entire stay up front (before we saw the room). Then when we got to the room, it reeked of cigarettes and had cigarette burns on everything. There were roaches coming in under the door and smashed bugs on the wall! There was no hot water... More
0	Not Nice. The room was clean, only good bit. The location was good. Staff were, Staff!! The corridors were old and need of an update, dirty and smelly. There were ice and coke machines that did not work. the Air con was noisy, we were travelling around so were not here too long thank goodness. It was in general old and needed an overhaul
0	The housekeeping staff is very dishonest.... Never make a mistake and leave anything behind. The housekeeping staff will claim to not have seen it. There is no point of having a lost and found and this hotel....very disappointing for a Hilton
0	The choices are tough in this area. Our room is 24 (second to the last away from the highway). We had booked 17, but we are told that the occupants are extending. The rooms are different prices and differently equipped. No real detail is offered, as there is no consistency room to room. There is a porch allowing the front of the rooms. The railing is falling... More
1	Great hotel if you attend a Phillies Game!. We always choose Hampton Inns and we were not disappointed during our stay. We chose this particular hotel because of it's proximity to Citizens Park (10 minutes away). We were greeted warmly at the front desk and by all of the housekeeping staff. The only suggestion I have is regarding the breakfast the eggs were a little weird (they tasted ok but they looked fake) and there should probably be more than one waffle maker to eliminate a long wait time. We will continue to choose Hampton Inns for our future trips and will definitely stay at this particular hotel the next time we attend a Phillies (or Flyers) game.Thank you for your kind words and feedback regarding your recent stay at the Hampton Inn Philadelphia Airport. We look forward to serving you again soon if your travels should bring you back to Philadelphia.Director of Sales
1	Nicest Hampton EVER. Likely the fanciest Hampton I have ever stayed in. Very large property, very modern and clean with a huge common area off the lobby. I think this Hampton may have the most awesome breakfast buffet in terms of size I have ever seen, and I have stayed at a LOT of Hamptons. Triple waffle iron area with 4 times the variety of toppings... say wahIn all seriousness, the rooms were very nice, clean and comfortable. The entire property was. The front desk staff was super friendly and welcoming. It felt like an upscale Hampton here.Now, they lost one star for two reasons - parking, they charge. To me it is insane to charge a customer for parking unless you are MAYBE downtown where I get parking is a commodity. This is Hotel Circle for crying out loud and they charge 18 bucks a day which is ridiculous. I have status with Hilton so they did lower my parking to 10 per day but it was still annoying and felt like they were simply trying to generate more revenue... particularly due to there was PLENTY of parking. The other reason was the housekeeping. We were there four nights and I had to call for housekeeping to come clean up my room. My husband had spilled a little something on the sheets and I was very surprised that they did not flip out the bottom sheet. Nope, left the stain there which was kind of gross. When they finally did clean, it was a half-hearted job, no toiletry or coffee refills, half the towels, etc. The front desk always came through for me though so it was not that big of a deal in the bigger scheme of things.
0	Two fire alarms- the 1st @ 1am, 2nd @ 3 am. The response from the desk was basically too bad, not our fault. So much for customer service!!!!
1	Great value no complaints. This hotel is on Poydras Street, which is about a 7 min walk from the French Quarter. It is a safe area, and the advantage of its location vs staying within the Quarter is that it is quiet at night and closer to the Superdome and basketball arena, Riverwalk area, and the excellent National WWII Museum. It is also very close to a really good diner called Mothers if you don't want to walk to the Quarter for a meal.The hotel offers large, clean rooms, complementary breakfast, free drinks and coffee, free dinner (they call it a snack, but with hot dogs, fried chicken, meatballs, vegetables and cocktails, I call it a buffet dinner), and friendly, helpful service.Only drawbacks are the somewhat insipid breakfast, and the old building and rooms (which admittedly is part of the charm).All in all, a great choice.
0	Room billed and no room available. Expedia charged me for the room, but Hotel did not honor the reservation. HJotel sent me to expedia and expedia to hotel TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE with Expedia
1	Perfect place to stay in New Orleans. This hotel was an example of 'Southern Hospitality'. At check in the lady (I am sorry but I dont recall her name) was sheer professionalism and charm. Clearly she has been here a long time and made fell very welcome. The rooms are excellent and spotless. Self serve drinks and snacks after 3pm are great and breakfast is excellent. All other facilities are great and internet/free printing very useful. The location is great - far enough away from the noise of Bourbon St but only a 5 minute walk. Convenience store 3 blocks away and downtown shops, etc close too. I wouldn't stay anywhere else.
0	Dirty but cheap. We had difficulty finding this motel. It is closer to Knott's Berry Farm over Disneyland. The check in lobby smelled of urine. The hotel does not have a lift of any sort for the second floor, therefore consider this if climbing stairs is an issue....More
1	Visited Talking Stick resort arena. It's a very nice hotel for the price. Its updated and appeared very modern. Valet is 25 or you have to find public parking. Check-in was nice easy and staff is friendly. Room 512 was very modern looking. There is no carpet it's all concrete floors but it does have rugs. Bathroom was nice and clean. Bed and pillows were comfortable. Only negative about the bed was the metal frame around it. We hit our knees a couple times on it so that was unpleasant. The lobby Bar was great with good happy hour food and drinks. Rail station stop is across the street. We took Lyft to the Arena which was about 5 mins away. Went to Club Luxx (which is a block away) after for a concert after party. Club was great with great music. Checkout was a breeze and breakfast in the lobby was good. Thank you Jesus! We're happy to hear you had a great experience.
1	Free airport parking and a great bed. I was looking for a place to stay near the airport and park my car for the duration of our trip. Drury Inn was a great place to stay. I parked for free for a week. The bed was probably the most comfortable hotel bed I've slept on!Thank you for your stay and kind words. We are happy you enjoyed our stay and fly package. We recently replaced our mattresses during our renovation and have enjoyed very good feedback. I need to try and get one for my house. Thank you for your business and we look forward to serving you in the future! Kind regards,Eric Gray
1	Nicest team we've ever met. We stayed at this hotel during a family vacation both before and after we got back on our plane home. They made every combination they could for our family. My daughter was short a little bit of money buying a candy bar and they gave it to her anyways. The swimming pool was perfect it was warm and it was always a few kids in there to play. The rooms were comfortable and cool. The Wi-Fi worked perfectly. The breakfast was excellent with choices for just about everybody. I don't think you could expect much more from a hotel. Great job we will be backThank you for your kind words. We love to hear that our guests enjoy their time with us and look forward to seeing you again next time you are in the area!
1	Good Location and Great Breakfast. I stayed at this hotel for four nights and enjoyed my stay. The location was convienantly located next to I-95 (although somewhat hard to find the first time due to the congestion of the area) and a 5-10 minute drive to the Franconia-Springfield metro station. The free breakfast included all you can eat scrambled eggs, fried potatoes, and waffles along with the usual fare, a nice touch. The breakfast room was kept clean and well stocked by an ever present staff member. The staff was about the friendliest and most helpful of any hotel I've stayed in. My only complaints would be a weak air conditioner and noisiness in the early evening due to the large number of children staying there. Quiet overnight, though.
0	Bad attitude staff. They told me my husband could check in without me but when he arrived they stated I had to be there. They were unprofessional with bad attitudes. There were grown women intoxicated knocking on doors and running. They were in the halls making a lot of noise. This hotel has a club inside and attract the wrong people.
0	Never again. This was one of the worst hotel stays that I have ever encountered they have cleaned our room they left the dirty sheets on the floor after they made the bed they didn't clean the bathroom it was just awful and I would never ever recommend this particular hotel to anyone it was really low budget the staff here at... More
0	Some things right... so many things wrong. The building looks beautiful the lobby too. They upgraded me to a room with 2 bedrooms, 3 tvs and 2 baths! I was ecstatic at first. But more things wrong than I've ever encountered in 1 hotel room: 1. The a/c, even when set to 65, was warmish, and only blowed in the entryway, not in the bed area.2. The light next to the bed was linked to the entry light: if you wanted the bed light to work, you had to have that hall light on. If you turned that off, the bed light went off too.3. No ironing board!4. Nothing to put the soap on, just the bathroom counter. That's icky.5. The bedspread was cool looking, but not something I'd like to sit on or sleep under. But if I peeled that away there was just the sheet. 6. That entryway was dark, even with its one light turned on.7. The counter with the coffee machine was dark too, even with the light turned on.8. Get rid of coffee dispensed in those plastic cup thingies - so bad for the environment!I lost count after that, but you get the idea. All these things could be tweaked and it would be a good place.
0	Terrible. I hope this is a warning to others. I was planning to attend a convention in September in Atlanta, GA. I booked at this hotel in February earlier this year. 3 days before I was to leave for the convention, the hotel emailed me stating they could not honor my reservations, but had moved me to another of their chain hotels some miles away. This was unacceptable due to the convention being in this hotel. I called and talked to management and was told that YES, we did purposely overbook the hotel, and that YES this is Marriott company policy. I was also told I would receive a call from the hotel manager the next day. This did not happen, nor would the initial front end manager answer her phone or return any voice mails. BEWARE, a confirmation number with Marriott means nothing. I am appreciative of the early warning however, as I was able to completely cancel the trip and cut at least some of my expense losses.
0	King's Crown is a Bit Off. The front desk receptionist was very nice and helpful I think this was the strongest point of the hotel . I was told ahead I would have a corner room on the third floor , it did not look anything g like the photographs and was given the second floor . The view was a pipe out the window .... More
0	I got stuck in the elevator for 40mins. Aside from the elevator incident, we had no house keeping and ran out of toiletries and also clean towels. Breakfast food was good but the way they have the setup of the plates makes thinks very crowded.Thanks for sharing Julie C. Certainly not a typical experience and I am so sorry to hear about the issue with the elevator. Please feel free to reach out to me directly to discuss your experience. Thanks again!
0	It was ok. The grounds for the hotel was ok....I feel they should advise you that part of the motel is across a 4 lane road...and the rooms can be a lot cleaner than they were.

1	Fabulous family stay in la jolla. Just checked out of the Pantai Inn and missing it already. Wonderful staff, great location. Highly recommend. We stayed 5 nights in a 2 room cottage. Right on the beach and breakfast complimentary every morning.Greetings carollkemp8, Thank you for taking the time to review Pantai Inn. We miss you already too! It was certainly all the teams pleasure to ensure that you had a memorable experience here. We certainly have a wonderful Inn and are in one of the best locations. As side from our phenomenal location, we are certainly blessed with some flexible accommodations, a plethora of complimentary amenities, and most importantly, a fantastic team of hospitality professionals. Hopefully next time your travels bring you out our way, we will be the first choice for you! Warmest regards, Mike
1	Good Disneyland option. This hotel is not one I had ever considered when going to Disneyland because it is further out than others. But on this trip I was looking for low cost so I decided to try it out. I'm glad I did! I was pleasantly surprised with how fast and easy it was to get to the park using the shuttle. It was never crowded and often we were t he only people riding. As far as the rooms go they were on par with other places I have stayed in the area. The breakfast vouchers for Denny's worked out great for my party of two. We were in and out in 30 minutes each day and the shuttle stop was right out front. I'm not sure how I would feel about the breakfast if I had been with a larger family with kids, but I did notice you can get pancakes for 2 so maybe it wouldn't be so bad.

The shower's hot water, turned up all the way was not hot. The complimentary breakfast area had a bathroom (unisex) that workers were using while we were trying to... More
0	Noisy renovation underway. I spent two nights here on what was a VERY busy weekend, due, I imagine, to any number of colleges ending their spring semesters. The hotel was jammed with visitors and because I arrived late in the day, I got what must have been the last room, even though I had had a reservation for several weeks. I was put in a handicap-access room on the first floor, which was spacious and seemed quiet due to its location at the end of the hall. However, at 7:45 am the construction crew started working in the room directly over my head and I was awakened by the sound of someone scraping the floor above my bed. So much for sleeping in for a late work day ahead...I complained by phone to the front desk and they apologized and promised to move me for the second night of my stay. Two hours later I checked in at the desk to see if I could move before I had to leave for work, but was told that the hotel was again booked solid and they would see what could be done. At that point, I got angry and mentioned that I had requested the change hours before, I am a Hilton Honors member, and anything else that I could think of that would persuade the agent to make the change. She did point out that the renovation work was posted on their website, and there was a printed apology in the lobby, neither of which made me any less sleepy...She finally found a room on the third floor, which was above the floor being worked on, and I moved. It was a nicer room. HOWEVER, bright and early the next morning (Sunday) the sounds of a power nailer wafted up through the vent in the bathroom. Luckily, I had to be at work early that day anyway, so I was already up. If you are booked here, try to get as far from any renovation construction as possible. Thank you for taking the time to tell us about your recent experience at our hotel. We are very sorry that you werent happy with your guestroom during your recent trip. We try to accommodate all reservations but occasionally we cant meet every room request. Your feedback is important us. Were very sorry for the noise issue you encountered in the morning.

1	Nice Hotel,Good Value. We stayed at The Hotel Nikko SF from May31-June 3 2007 when we went to San fran for a friend's wedding.We chose this hotel for the great value it offered.Unlike the previous reviewer who had complaints about the bathroom and overall cleanliness of the room, our room which was on the 6th floor was kept clean at all times.The bed was very comfortable with plenty of pillows and we liked the plasma TV.We had a problem with the plumbing in the tub at one point but as soon as we notified the frontdesk, it was fixed right away.Our room did not include use of the pool and fitness area but when we wanted to take a 30min. swim in the pool and asked the front desk if they would waive the 10 fee, they obliged.Room service menu late night very limited and not freshly prepared but there is a 24hr Indian food rest. across the street which is pretty good from what i've heard.If we go to San Fran again, we would likely stay at the Nikko again.If you plan on renting a car, do not rent at the enterprise located in the hotel it is very expensive, go to the National/Alamo across the street, you'll get a better value
0	Try to go elsewhere, bed bugs!. This place was just ok, sketchy looking clientele lingering around outside, immediately next to the highway so ask for a room on the not highway side of the building.

0	Disappointed. One night staff theaten to call police and lock the doors as one our members (coach was in the sitting area with a player). He was rude and could of spoke to the guests in a polite manner before giving the rude ultimatum as there was a loud party not from our group making noise the night before. Rooms has a old smell and I had to spray the pillows and sheets with frebreeze. Housekeeping missed cleaning our room one day as they said we refused cleaning, I asked all the guest in the room and they said this never happened. Also housekeeping was performed very late in many of our groups rooms. Perhaps more cleaning staff is needed during the busy Albion cup weekend. The internet needs faster speed, perhaps this is the way Hampton makes money if guest are frustrated with the complimentary internet.Rooms should have 2 queen beds instead of 2 double beds as they are very small for 4 adults. I used the coffee maker/fridge/microwave, happy they were available but they could use upgrading.The pool was cool and there was no hot tub. It would also be benificial to have laundry on site- even if we have to pay for it. Overall, I would not recommend this hotel to future guest on TripadvisorThank you for your review. We greatly appreciate your feedback and we sincerely apologize for the issues that you experienced during your stay. We will be sure to take your comments about our property under consideration as we re-evaluate guest needs and continually work to improve our guest experience. We hope you will consider staying with us again the next time your travels bring you to our area.Thank you,Hotel Management

1	So good, we had to come back. This was our second visit and we loved it once again. We are upgraded to a King Suite, which provided plenty of room for our family. We came in late and asked to have the pull out ready so we could put our girls to bed and were happy to find everything ready for us. The staff is great and would always greet us by name as we came and went. They provided us with great snacks for the whole family to enjoy. It is always nice having the wine social hour and meeting other guests. There is construction going on right across the street. We were provided ear plugs, but since our little one wakes us up we were up before the work began (about 7am). If you are a really light sleeper you might want to ask for the other side of the building, but it was not that bad.Hello Melody B,Love this review! Thank you so much. Were so glad you and your family enjoyed your 2nd stay. We cant wait for your 3rd stay! JustinAssistant General Manager

1	Perfect location!. We only had two days to spend in Baltimore so I chose this hotel based on it's location. It was even better than I anticipated. Walking distance to Fell's Point. The room was spacious and well appointed. It was loud in the morning with breakfast in the lobby and housekeeping starts knocking at 8am sharp. They'll keep knocking too which was irritating so if you want to sleep past 8 put the privacy card on your door handle. Breakfast ends at 10 which I wasn't told at check-in and didn't see in writing anywhere so we missed that the first day. We were there for crabby hour and it was delicious and a nice touch to the stay! I saw other reviews complaining about parking, we didn't have an issue. There's a lot and a ramp right next door.
1	very good. The breakfast is very good! the hotel is clean and safe! Good location near to the highway! The staff is nice! But the internet should be improved. overall, San Diego is very beautiful.

0	Valentine's day disaster. My boyfriend and I just returned from The Chelsea after our stay on Saturday the 12th. We are both local (we both live in Absecon, 10 minutes outside of Atlantic City). Since we live so close, we rarely splurge and spend the on a room for one evening. This year we wanted to celebrate Valentine's day with a special treat. Our friend Eddie, an employee of the Chelsea, suggested spending a night there. We looked online and were really excited by the photos. We appreciated the art deco decor and throwback feel of the hotel. When we checked in, the front desk employee informed us that we would be in the Annex portion of the hotel. Our room was A DISASTER!! Main lamp was broken, shower mat was filthy, shower head completely off the wall, tv did not work, the toilet did not fliush and the room WAS NOTHING LIKE what was portrayed on the website. When we went to the front desk, the manager said there was nothing they could do about the room or the toilet. He said he would comp our breakfast the next morning. We found out later that the Annex portion of the hotel was being gutted next week. That is all well and good, but this should have been made clear when the reservation was made. Its a shame that locals get treated so poorly.
1	Slightly dated, but I felt welcomed. My husband and I and our infant and child stayed here to break up a trip while driving home to Florida from Missouri.Room:Cleanliness- the room was overall clean and felt fresh.The bathroom was clean but I noticed a small human body hair on the neatly folded washcloths. I prayed it was a beard hair. The tub seemed a little worn and I didn't want to bathe my infant in it. The shower was extra hot and enjoyable. The beds are by far the best I've slept in. If you've ever enjoyed a Marriott bed you know what I'm talking about!There were ample pillows and the linens were nice. I'm not certain on the detergent used but it made my son and I break out on our faces.I felt the bathrooms could be updated. I stayed at a Marriott in Winnipeg and loved the design. These bathrooms felt cheap. The vinyl feeling walls were cracked and chipped and bubbled and the paint was off. I felt they only provided bare minimum toiletries. Parking was easy for us, which was a plus.The staff was very very kind! I felt welcomed.The breakfast was really good and left me wanting hot oatmeal with all the toppings each morning after I left! Delicious spread! I would recommend some sort of iced tea or cold offering other than juice.Other than the sub par bathroom, I liked this Fairfield. The woman who checked us out was a Denver Broncos fan like us and was SO friendly. I wanted to have coffee with her she was so kind!Dear Kaylee, Thank you for sharing your experience at the Fairfield Inn Suites Atlanta Buckhead through TripAdvisor.With a mission to provide superior customer service, we take great pride in serving your needs and are delighted to hear that we have met your expectations.

1	Very nice hotel with a great location. This hotel is located a few blocks from the Westgate Link station, so you can easily get around Seattle. Pike Market is a short walk and you can even walk to the waterfront if you like. Check in service is excellent, the front desk and the hotel workers are always friendly and willing to help out. Room is very clean with a large bathroom. My only complaint is the ice machines are not located on all floors, although the hotel says they can someone up with some ice for you. Also the safe in the rooms are located on a high shelf in the closet, see pictures, if you were a short person not sure you could even use it.The hotel does not have its own restaurant, you need to walk next door to the Ruth Chris to eat, but they were open for breakfast. There is a Starbucks and a small convenience store near the hotel.Although the hotel had some minor issues, I would stay here again next time I visit Seattle.
0	Don't Stay Here. Pot smokers on the balcony, hookers going door to door. No thank you. Bad hotel in a bad part of town. Stay somewhere else. Not for families. Not for a good nights sleep. The manager and front desk clerk were very nice. Will give them that.

1	Tropical Grounds. Great Property! Great Price! Great Location! Great Pool!. This is a GREAT Hotel! I found this reasonably priced hotel and was very satisfied with my stay. I'm a tough customer. Fair but tough. The rooms are clean. Beds were comfortable. Newly renovated Restaurant and Pool. Parking is good. The grounds are tropical and well kept. The only thing I would want is a renovated bathroom in the rooms. A simple upgrade of tile and new countertops and fixtures would make this property even better. I will definitely stay here when I am in town again.Thank you nso much for the great review. Sounds like you were able to take advantage of all we have to offer. We can't wait to see you the next time you're in San Diego. Thanks again.
0	Find another hotel!. We normally stay at Best Western Hotels but will never stay at this one again. If you complain or ask for something, they'll ignore you. The room smelled which leads me to believe it wasn't clean. When I asked for extra towels they told me to come get them myself.....found a cleaning cart and grabbed them in the hallway. We would have moved to another hotel if we would of had the time!Dear Terric890I am sorry to hear that you did not have a good experience while staying at hotel. I am sorry that you were made to feel ignored. I will be talking with our staff about your experience and we will make sure that it does not happen again. I will also forward your comments to the housekeeping department. We will work to correct any issues to make sure that it does not happen again. Thank you very much for your feedback and I am sorry that you had a bad experience. Your comments matter to us.
1	Nice room and great staff!. Stayed in this hotel last week. The manager and staff were very nice and friendly. The room was clean (even behind stuff), the bed was comfortable, and it was quiet. The hotel offered lots of extras for free such as free hot breakfast, drinks in the evening, hot dinner, and long distance calls. While the food was bland and tastelss, it was there for anyone that did not want to go out for decent tasting food. The bartender poured good drinks and it was a good opportunity to meet some of the other hotel guests and the hotel staff. The manager made it a point to stop at tables and talk to guests and get to know them. All-in-all it was an excellent stay and very good value! The only item that could be considered a complaint was that even with the heat off my room was hot. I had to turn the AC on to get a comfortable temp.
1	Great for Families!. My boyfriend and I booked a last minute trip for the holiday weekend. First and foremost - the price was outstanding! We were quite pleased with it.The hotel was recently renovated and the rooms were very modern. The bed was heavenly and the room was comfortable overall. Also, the hotel is close to several local eateries, movie theater and the Silver Comet trail. There is a quiet restaurant, a cool bar, and a very convenient coffee bar in the hotel. The rooms were very large and easily accommodated all of our things (including 2 bikes). I also used the spa while there and was pleasantly surprised at the level of service. The spa was not very plush, but the staff was great and the service that I received was excellent.The only problems that we experienced were the kids that were running around the hotel all weekend (hence my title - great for families). The layout of the hotel seemed to make the parents comfortable with letting them roam (it is a very open hotel with visibility of the door to almost every room from any other room in the the hotel). The only other problem was that the room was not cleaned as thoroughly as it could have been. Although all of the room's accessories were new and modern (new lamps, bedding, towels, etc), the cleaning of the room was sub-par (like a 6 on a 1-10 scale). This was really our only ding on the hotel. Overall, great stay. And, if we ride the Silver Comet trail again, we'll probably stay at this same hotel.I appreciate your detailed feedback regarding your stay with us, it really does help us recognize areas we are doing well and those that need additional focus. I will share your comments with my Housekeeping Manager and ensure we follow through with additional training for that staff member. Please come back to see us soon!
0	Lipstick on a pig. Travelling all the way from Louisiana to New Hampshire with a friend and a 10 month old pup we needed a pet-friendly hotel. I will say the management is interested in our thoughts, as they did respond to my review, so they are trying. This is an OLD hotel with renovated interiors. That still smell like smoke when the room... More
0	This place is thrashed.. Paid 600 a night because it was jazzfest. King Bourbon Street Balcony room. Expected a private balcony on Bourbon Street as I had called several times to confirm this fact. When we checked in there was some sort of problem and the guy leaves to go into a back room to straighten something out. At that point we knew there was some sort of issue. He comes back to the counter and tells us we have the most requested room in the hotel. Sounds pretty good, right Nope. Got a corner room on Toulouse and Bourbon with a SHARED balcony. Of course because of the balcony location on the corner, everyone wanted to sit right in front of our balcony door even though the tables in front of their balcony doors were empty. I was told there was nothing I could do about it because it was a shared balcony. BUMMER. I wouldn't have paid 600 a night for a shared anything. It truly sucked. When I asked the front desk to please ask the people in front of my door to move to the table in front of their own door I was rudely told it was a shared balcony and there was nothing I could do about it. Then the guy proceeded to hang up on me. LOL Because I'm a member of Starwood I called and complained. They credited me with 12,000 points (which is good for a free nights' stay in most of their hotels) but I would have preferred to just cut my losses and be refunded for all three nights so I could get out of there.The room was tiny and so thrashed. Look at the photos. Torn curtains hanging. Beat up furniture, missing hooks in bathroom, mold in bathroom, shower rod hanging off of cracked shower tiles. The batteries kept falling out of the safe so they came and duct taped them in. Yes, they actually duct taped it. Seriously, the place is a dive. There was no heat (A/C stuck on blast) and no hot water. They were not happy that we wanted it fixed. They never did fix the heat but they eventually did come and take the faucet apart in the bathroom and we had hot water after two days of no hot water.I will say... the lobby area and common areas are actually really nice. The staff is very rude and acts like everything is an inconvenience to them but the lobby really is nice.I'm not sensitive to noise so I have no complaints about that. However, there is a club on each corner of this particular room and they go loud until 4am. Like I said, doesn't bother me but just something to be aware of. I like the loud music and party atmosphere and the bed was comfortable so I had no problem sleeping.Don't waste your money. This is a one star hotel charging five star prices.Thank you TnCWenzl for your feedback. On behalf of the Four Points by Sheraton French Quarter, please accept my apology for the inconvenience you experienced with us during your recent stay. We strive to ensure our guests experience the best visits possible during their travels and we fell short of our goal this time. We hope you give us another try on your next trip to New Orleans!
1	Bijoux, period hotel in a great location. This is a great place to stay in Atlanta. There are bars and restaurants close by and it is a nice, safe area to walk around. There are bus stops near by and it is a pleasant twenty minute walk to the MARTA station which goes to the airport. There is a vegetarian restaurant next door but we went to Manuel's bar down the road which is a great place to eat. There is also Publix supermarket just round the corner. The staff were really friendly and helped us out when we needed to use a phone to call our car hire company. The breakfast was minimal but there are places to eat nearby so it isn't a problem. The place is 'european style' and is decorated in a quirky way. A great place to stay.
0	Do not recommend !. We made our reservation in advance. When we arrived the lobby was very cluttered and dirty . We checked in and paid cash for our rooms. When we entered our room it had a very bad odor. I pulled the bedspread and sheets back and there appeared to be some type of small bugs. The sheets and bedspread either were... More
0	Super 8 suffices in a pinch. Pleasant check in, room.smelled.like stale smoke, a few dead bugs on the Floor and had to go through a swarm.to enter the room. There were red stains on.the door that seemed odd..dead bugs Building is fairly.dated but room was updated except.for the bed condition. It was not comfortable at all. The shower was good, hot and strong. Breakfast was very nice and goes until 10am. they needed more seating though for guests. Not a bad hotel..would.probably choose a different one next time.
1	Best Place Ever. Stayed here from October 12-18th. Excellent location, away from the hustle and bustle of the strip traffic. Great eating places around, shopping for ones who like to shop. One the greatest bingo halls ever. I came her in April and won 46,080.00 playing bingo, came back this time and my husband won 1430.00 playing bingo and then won another 500.00 when they called his name on a raffle drawing.Rooms are to die for, absolutely beautiful, had a wonderful view of the city, mountains and golf course. Next door also in two other casinos to enjoy, and 5minutes away is the beautiful Red Rock Casino.The slots are also nice to play, did not win a lot, but stayed alive and did not lose my shirt.Will definitely be coming back to stay.
1	Hotel stay. This Hilton hotel is one of our favorite. The staff is very accommodating and the service is terrific. We stay here for business every few weeks. Keep up the great work! We plan on staying at this property every time we are in the Orlando area. Thank you for returning to the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport. There is no better compliment than a guest who keeps coming back time after time! I'm so glad you continue to enjoy our exceptional service. It is always a pleasure to have you as our guest, and we look forward to your next business stay! Thanks again.Sincerely,Michael GoldwasserGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport
1	Meh. Check the boxes for a great location and a clean room. That said, this W seems to lack the pop that other W's have. There's nothing special, trendy, or quirky about the rooms. .. a bit of a disappointment. I was also a bit put off by not having a coffee pot available in the room. Although there was coffee available in the lobby, I prefer to get up and make my own. No big deal. In fact, none of this is a big deal... it's just not what I expected when I booked based upon past W experiences. Yes, I'd stay there again.Hello,Thank you very much for your feedback. Hope to see back soon!Thank you,Nadia
0	Rooms were dusty and nasty. Hi, I had to change two rooms due to the dust and the nastiness of the rooms. The third room sink was stopped up, but I got tired of changing rooms. I will not recommend the Wingate on Cobb Pkwy to anyone.
1	Central location in City. The Central Loop Hotel is in the middle of the hustle bustle of downtown Chicago. They offer a lovely sitting room for visitors to enjoy a cup of coffee and visit with other travelors which we found a plus while using Chicago as a central meeting place for an annual get together with my husbands family. The hotel is very clean and the staff excellent, working to make your vist the best it can be. The restaurant in the hotel had good food with great coffee making it a good choice for a convenient breakfast. The rooms are average, but very clean, although we found them a bit stingy with linnens offering just one towel per person. The best part of this hotel is the location making it within walking distance of the museums and shopping. I highly recommend this hotel if you are ok with staying in a busy, central location.
0	Underwhelming for the price. I am not one to complain being that my husband has been in the hotel business for over 40 years but this experience was not good at all. First of all, they required that I pay the entire 3 night stay upfront (never heard of that), the grounds were unkept with cigarette butts everywhere, I had to call for towels... More
0	Really suprised at how my reservation went and the noise!!. When I called into the customer service number to initially make my reservation for my stay, I was quoted a price of 134USD plus taxes. I repeatedly asked the customer service rep the price and he repeatedly answered 134USD plus tax. However, when I arrived at the hotel two days later I was charged 149USD plus tax. I have called customer service 4 times to explain my situation and to get an understanding of why I was overcharged at the hotel, however, I am to this day unable to find a manager at the call center to solve my discrepancy. I explained my situation at the hotel yet they refused to listen and explained that I would have to call customer service. On top of all this, I asked if I would be able to do a late checkout at 2 pm and the front desk attendant responded that I would have to be charged an extra 25 dollars. I was given a king suite and it had a shared door with another room. There was noise coming from the next room though out the night, and it was as if the other people were in the same room as me.My experience definitely did not live up to the Hilton standards that I once knew. Nor my standards for that matter.Hi Roving,Thank you for sharing your experience, I have revised your reservation and it appears that it was booked as a breakfast package. In this case, the rate goes up by every occupant in the room and it appears it was changed from one guest to two guests. I due apologize that we did not exceeded your expectations during your stay, if there is anything else I can do for you please don't hesitate to call (858) 278 9300 ext 0Thank you for staying with us and we hope we can serve you in the future.Happy Holidays!
0	Tired old hotel. I had a surprisingly disappointing stay at what I thought was supposed to be a nice hotel. We were moving apartments close by, and I booked a 3 night stay. The service was almost non-existent. We asked for a crib before check-in, then again three separate times after we checked in. It finally arrived after 11 PM! We asked for silverware so that we could eat our room service. Never brought it. We ended up eating with coffee stirrers in the room. No one offered a smile or hello, or offered to open a door when I was coming through with a stroller. The rooms are very dated. Overall, just a very disappointing stay. It seems like this hotel is just resting on a famous name.Dear LK198200,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. While we wish you had a better experience, it is feedback like this that we learn from and use to improve. We work hard to deliver an exceptional guest experience, and it's apparent in this case that we fell short. It is important to us to do what we can to make amends for your stay. If you would like to further discuss your visit, please don't hesitate to reach out to our Hotel Manager, Massimiliano Puglisi, directly at Massimiliano.PuglisiRosewoodhotels.com. If you give us a chance to earn back your trust, I can assure you that we will do our best to give you the great hotel experience that so many of our guests have grown so fond of. Wishing you all the best!Sincerely, The Carlyle Family
0	Shocked. Honestly, it's probably isolated with a particular staff member but I am shocked. Front desk is typically your go to person for everything you need but during my stay this is an exception. It's so ridiculous I feel odd even writing this. I ordered a pizza which has nothing to do with the hotel but after an hour and a half I call the pizza place and they say it was left at the front desk because the hotel couldn't reach me. I called the front desk and he stated he tried to call the cell and the room and talked to someone(not me) that said they didn't want the pizza. I told him we were waiting for the pizza and of course we would of answered any call to the room. His response was are you calling me a liar. I called your room and you didn't answer!! I've never dealt with any front desk staff at any hotel I've ever stayed at that was so blatantly obtuse, defensive, and mean. Maybe he was having a bad day but it's borderline childish. He told me the pizza is here come and get it. I did and it was ice cold just sitting there and he was super rude during the exchange. Horrible service.The hotel itself is nice and check in was good. Rooms are clean and overall I would be satisfied if it wasn't for this particular staff member. What a shame.Aleator,Thank you for taking the time to share your recent experience with us.One of our key priorities is to provide the highest level of friendly and courteous service. While it was a pleasure having you here as our guest, your feedback regarding the service our team provided caught my attention.I am very sorry to learn that the quality of service provided by our front desk staff did not quite meet your or our expectations. Please rest assured that your comments have been shared with the team in an effort to improve our overall hotel operations.Thank you for being a valued customer and we hope to serve you again whenever your travels bring you back to Chicago.
1	great location. the room was good, smelt very strongly of bleach when we first arrived, but I guess that means they were cleaning!! Loved the location, so convenient to the beach, a lovely walk along the oceanfront to the pier and lots of restaurants and supermarkets close by. Loads of parking,but didn't really need the car once we were there.Thank you, Michael. Your review was very nice and I'm really glad you enjoyed your stay with us. We are in the process of updating our first section of rooms again this fall, so everything should be very fresh. I hope you willl stay with us again.
0	How the mighty have fallen!. This used to be my favourite hotel. From now on you're only someone that I used to love. Perhaps they underperformed so dramatically due to a perfect storm of challenging events. It is a holiday weekend, the World Cup is being played in a city full of Immigrants who are all as football (Soccer) mad as I am and to add insult to injury, a major young celebrity is in residence at the hotel. Along with the celebrity has come HORDES of young teenaged girls who have overrun the parking lot, the hotel lobby, the elevator bays AND the hotel BAR! There has been no apparent effort to restrict the access of these obviously non resident children who have been camped out here for days. Hotel guests have been forced to navigate around, over, beside and under them simply to get service. Perhaps due to the nature of the crowd, the usual calm sophistication and unhurried pace of the hotel has vanished and the edges are beginning to show serious wear. There were so many short comings on this trip and far too many opportunities to regret the bill prior to its arrival. A hotel of this purported caliber should never cause one to feel there is a value for money disparity. Your unique selling proposition should be that you are SOOOOO good, I forget how much it costs. While I still hold a particular fondness for the MO- Miami, I have had to draw several uncomplimentary parallels to the much vaunted Ritz Carlton service standards and the Regis' brand of sedateness(stuffiness depending on the POV)and I, for the first time, find the MO outclassed. More's the pity.
0	Bad enough to not want to stay in any Quality brand hotel again. We travel to Six Flags over GA pretty frequently. This was our first and last time for staying at this hotel. I'm generally a 4-5 star reviewer of hotels, with the occasional 3 star, here and on Trip Advisor, but this was my worst experience. There are plenty of problems with this place, but I'll start with the pros:Pro: Location to 6 Flags and room comfort. Both of these and parking were fine.Cons: It is not an overstatement to say this was the worst check in experience I've ever had, and not one interaction with staff the rest of the stay would change that. From walking into the hotel to check-in to finally walking into my room was probably 45-60 minutes, and when you are traveling with family, it's late at night, and you have to get up early, that's 45 minutes you can use. I walked in to the hotel, and I was probably 3rd or 4th to check in, and the line never moved as it took them forever to resolve what appeared to be simple problems. I don't know what the other customer issues were, but they weren't the problems. By the time I got there, I could see why it took a long time. A routine check in with reservations took longer here then anywhere else. When I did finally get my room keys, I go up to room with family who have been waiting WAY TOO LONG, and the keys don't work (and yes, I've stayed in enough hotels to know how to use hotel key cards). So after trying for several minutes, I go back down to front desk, wait in line for about 5 more minutes for the two workers to take care of routine check ins, and have the worker re key the cards again (and this time I watched to make sure he did them, and they did work when I returned to room).In my room, I check the safe, and on the safe it has the note about if you don't want to be billed for not using the safe, tell front desk on check out. So the next morning, I tell front desk we didn't use the safe, and yet, he still put it on my bill and would not remove.And this is why I think it is a Quality Brand issue. They aren't checking on their hotels at all. This comment has been made repeatedly on this website and the Choice Hotels website, but it is a problem.On the 3rd floor, the elevator has only 1 button, since you can only go down, but the arrow points up (little thing that make no difference on my stay, but demonstrate lack of care). The privacy door latch was put up backwards, so that it couldn't do anything to keep someone from opening the door. These lack of attention to details isn't a big thing by themselves, but the accumulation of them is a general sloppiness in maintenance that is apparent.Dear Guest. I would like to personally apologize for the series of unfortunate incidences that you experienced during your stay with us. We continually try to do our very best for all of our guests, but unfortunately, sometimes we do fail. I will look into each issue that you have noted, in an attempt to correct and improve our hotel policies. Sincerely, Hotel Manager
1	Best hosts ever!. You will find the friendliest people in the business in the lobby of this hotel. They made my stay so wonderful and helped me, my husband and my 1yo daughter out with something everyday. Walk out your room and take 5 steps to the beach, quaint beachside restaurants, coffee shops, AMAZING TACOS, etc. I have stayed here twice now, and I think I will be booking every time my family visits San Diego. I am giving the Pacific View Inn a good review so they can get plenty of business and always be there, but I kinda don't want to so they're not booked up next time I try to get a room. Wow! Kind words from great guests. Thank you for taking the time to share your experience Sarah. We try to make our guests feel at home, and it's good to hear you enjoyed the time with your family in Pacific Beach. San Diego is a great city and it's nice to share it with people like you. See you next time!

We had a room on the forth floor and was told it was non-smoking, it was, but, the other side of the hall was smoking and at night when we were trying to go to bed, the smell was so-bad, I began to suffer a headache and woke up congested. Never again will I stay at Quality Inn Suites,... More

We received the confirmation email from Priceline, and called TWO days prior to our check-in date to see if it would be possible to get an early check-in since the wedding... More
1	Recent renovations. Only reason not to give the hotel a 5 star rating is the fact you have to pay to park and for internet. Rarely do I ever pay for these items at other hotels across the country. Parking is understandable, however paying for internet combined with a higher than average parking fee especially compared to hotels on the same block that charge nothing for either is a major turn off. Otherwise a fantastic hotel with great service. Still some renovation work happening as of today May 8 however it didn't cause any problems and was not intrusive. Overall another great stay.
1	Excellent central location. Hotel Diva has a fantastic central location to Union Square, everything within walking distance. The location alone made this hotel so great. The rooms were a bit small, and the bathrooms could do with a renovation, but otherwise I found our room to be quiet comfortable and clean. The hotel is a trendy and boutique, the staff were excellent and very attentive. So very helpful and always greeted you!The walls were a little thin. Could hear the people in the room next door screaming and carrying on, partying etc on one night. Im not a prude but it got quite tiring and annoying after hours of it. The whole floor complained about them, and I heard staff constantly coming up to tell them to keep it down. The staff really tried to do their best and had to tell them if they get one more complaint they'd be thrown out. They kept it up afterwards and started bashing on the walls, so we called reception and they kicked them out. Apologised to everyone on the floor for the disturbance.Id stay here again, definately. The location is GREAT!
0	Poor hotel. Following a fourteen hour drive, we arrived, very tired, to check in at 3 AM on April 17th. I booked a non-smoking room but there was only a smoking room available. We were given the keys to room 410. This is an outside room in the back of the hotel that abuts a truck stop.  I used the bathroom which had water all over the floor, and went back into the main room. The room had stained carpets, lights that didnt work and things just didnt seem particularly clean. However, the bed was nicely made and we were very tired. I pulled back the bed spread to find rumpled sheets covered in blood. I chose to contact Expedia, whose representative contacted the front desk and arranged for a refund of all three reservations booked with this hotel. At my request Expedia also arranged for us to stay at a different hotel in the area. I do not believe that it takes much intelligence to connect the dots and determine what happened here.When we were back in town on Friday we stopped back to the hotel in an attempt to speak with the manager. We were told that he was not in.  I left a message asking that he call me, to which there has been no response. Even though this is a two star hotel, these conditions are disgusting.
0	it's a dump. Only positives are location and friendly staff. Hotel is a dump and they add a surprise 15 convenience charge on top of everything. You won't see any mention of this charge on your reservation. Lobby has been re-done and looks great but don't be fooled. Elevator area looks like war happened around it. I've seen freight elevators in better condition.... More
1	Home Away from home.. Anyone that's looking for a great hotel chain with fantastic customer service, professional, great prices in Atlantic City New Jersey The Best Western Envoy is the place where you will feel right at home.Overall I only use Best Western Hotel/motels whenever I travel. Excellent breakfast, excellent rooms, amenities decor location Best Western Hotels should be your number one choice. Thank you for staying at Best Western Envoy Inn, Atlantic City NJ. We are thrill to hear that you really enjoyed your stay. Yes we have fresh waffles for breakfast along with hard boiled eggs, sausage, many more items. Thank you for your feedback. It means a lot to us.
0	Not what you think....Please don't book here. After carefully reviewing places to stay, my friend and I decided on The Annex at the Chelsea. The photos looked nice and the reviews were good. Also, the amenities were good for that price point and location. We were greeted by the friendly and welcoming valet staff. We entered a nice lobby and the desk staff was pleasant. We get our keys and head all the way down the hall. It now appears that The Annex is not quite The Chelsea and should not be called The Annex at the Chelsea. From what I can see, The Annex was a small motel/hotel that was next door to The Chelsea, went out of business and The Chelsea decided to take it over. A really bad move for the Chelsea. The elevators were small and needed to be serviced, the carpet in the hall was nasty. Thanks for the dim lighting we were not able to see what the carpet really looked like. I really couldnt believe the bright neon lights on each floor. The neon lights made this place look even cheaper. We enter our room in disbelief. It felt like a prison. There were no real windows and the room had a weird smell. Not to mention, the dated furniture. We head back to the front desk to request a different room. We get a different room, not quite great but a little better. I do not recommend staying here. It is unbelievable the prices they charge for such a terrible place. This space should not be associated with The Chelsea. I recommend The Annex at the Chelsea be burned down and rebuilt.
0	Ok if you're desperate. We survived this place but it's not ideal. The ladies who run it are really nice and their intentions are good but I'd plan differently next time. It's not like other Best Westerns I've been in - it's a motel and though it is clean, it's in major need of renovation. I don't recommend it and won't be back.
1	Best Western Springfield, VA. Everything about this hotel is geared to the DC business traveler. Nothing is missing from the standpoint of communications inclusive of wireless net access. They provide more than just coffee and danish in the morning there is real food. Plus snack items designed to help you make it through a difficult day on the Hill. Convenience to the Metro is a big plus, and it's provided by a shuttle. Wait staff goes out of its way to accommodate and address problems if any. We have, of course, other options as far as where to stay in the DC area, but this Best Western has my vote hands down right price, right place, right service. It's a winning hand all the way.
0	Do not visit this hotel!. Staff members repeatedly entered my moms room late at night (there was no door latch) without her permission and invaded her privacy. The building manager was apologetic and offered a 15 discount. My mom was assured that senior management would contact her, and no one has. My room smelled of mildew and the bathroom was dingy. The shower dropped all night and kept me awake.
0	JUST SAY NO!!. We had 10 rooms asked the GM in advance to put the rooms close she said she would do her best. At check in, the front desk never received anything from their GM about our group. The hotel was dirty, online pics are deceiving. The rooms reeked of smoke some of us changed rooms. There was hair everywhere. I never saw a cleaning lady the entire time. There were only sheets on the beds, when I called the front for blankets they only had one to give to us so I gave it to my kids. The elevators were small filthy. Club guests were loud yelling in the halls from 9pm-3am. I had to ask the people next door to quiet down so my kids could sleep. Guests were smoking cigarettes weed in their rooms which overflowed into the halls. We had rooms on the 5th 6th floors it was like this for everyone. The pool was gross. The breakfast was decent, but they ran out of some food early. The staff was always nice besides the lady in the breakfast room who reminded me of a grumpy cafeteria lady. I had to wash everything that I took into that hotel when I got home, even if it was clean. My car stunk of stale cigarettes from our stuff being in it I had to get it detailed to get the smell out. This is not a family friendly hotel in any way, shape or form, DO NOT bring your kids here. If you want a cheap party hotel with a club where you can pass out drunk not care, this is right up your alley. Do yourself a favor spend the extra money.
1	Perfect Location, Very Comfortable, and affordable. We stayed at the Monticello Inn for Labor Day weekend. We were 2 couples each with our own room. Upon arrival we were promptly attended to and checked in quickly. Vallet took our vehicle and we headed up to our room. The street it is located on is (Ellis) runs into Powell which is the main street the Trolleys run up and down. This hotel is located in Union Square, your really are in the middle of a great shopping center! Each side you walk you've got shops Adidas, Puma, Bloomingdale's, etc etc! A+ for Location!Once we entered our room, the only negative thing about this whole expreience was the smell of Freshly baked Subway Bread! Ha ha, I believe because of the way the hotel is built the center subway is one level with it's vents on there roof, there roof is also the first floor of the 5 story or so hotel, so it vents into the shaft of sorts and straight into your a/c unit. Big woop! Seeing as we don't like to hibernate in our room when this city is alive, it didn't bother us one bit, except when you woke up in the morning crazy a sandwhich (he he). We reserved a one Bedroom Suite. Upon entering it we were surprised to see how roomy it was. You first enter a living room with a miniature refrigerator, big enough to fit a 2-liter and some can drinks. The Tv is a good sized tv, everything is clean and neat. The couch is comfy as well as the Chair. They have these gorgeous Bay windows with seats built all around it so you can absorb the light if you so choose, cause there isn't much of a view! The bedroom is completley seperate from the living room, there is a door that divides it ( not too common with suites) The decor is exactly as it appears on the website, the stripes look overbearing at first but they are not I assure you! The bed was very comfterble, the sheets where clean. It was very pleasant. The bathroom had a Shower tub Combo, clean as well, no rust or grime build up. This room was a perfect gathering space for us and our friends, seeing as they had gotten a standard room I did look at it and it was very spacious as well. Enjoy the Pictures and the hotel, it is in an incredible location!
0	very poor. dirty room
1	Great location, friendly staff. Great location right next to China town entrance, only a few blocks away from BART (take Montgomery exit as others have stated) and Union Square. Staff were friendly and helpful when asking for directions, recommendations. Room was very nice and beds comfortable. Only issue I had were the showers kept fluctuating pressure wise, no fan to help dissipate the steam, and kinda noisy at times in the morning (room was near the back/alleyway of the hotel).Thank you so much for sharing your experience, we truly appreciate your feedback. I am very happy to read that visit was an enjoyable one. I sincerely apologize for the issues you encountered during your stay. The fluctuating water pressure, sounds like a constricted filter screen in the shower head that could be easily replaced. As for the noise pollution, its difficult to escape in the city. Even with the double panned windows some noise gets through. Sometimes a higher floor can help eliminate the sound of traffic. We would be absolutely delighted to have you stay with us again in the future we will do our best to find you a quieter room. Kind regardsQuinn McEnteeFront Office Manager
1	More respect to customers' finance, please. We liked the hotel very much. The room was quite cosy. There was a shuttle service to the nearest subway station. The only thing I did not like is that our check-in receptionist wanted us to pay only by card. But the payment conditions of our cards do not allow taking money without entering a PIN code and by ourselves. The receptionist insisted by demanding if otherwise a 200 deposit (we had not known about this condition before) and we agreed about the card. The payment result in one day was declined payment and a blocked by our bank card (as the bank considered the payment suspicios or the card as stolen by an American). So, finally we paid cash. Please, respect customers and their banks' attempt to protect them. But altogether I did like our stay there and enjoyed it.
1	Day of Relaxation. This hotel was recommended to me by a friend for a day spa adventure. I must say the staff was great, The hotel environment was nicely decorated and the rooms were big and spacious. I used the spa for a massages and ate dinner at its restaurant. No complaints. I WILL stay here again.Thank you for your review. Your feedback is not only helpful to us, but will be very helpful for potential guests considering our hotel. I will be sure to pass along your kind comments about our customer service and the guest rooms to the team. Thanks again and we hope to welcome you back soon.
1	Reasonable value, convenient location. The hotel grounds were beautiful, they seemed to have quite a Mexican/ Spanish influence. The room itself was a bit tired but we were expecting this having seen photos. The air con was powerful but noisy. The pool was small but good for a city hotel and never too busy (we used it a fair amount). The hotel is huge though so I feel they were not at full occupancy. Location was excellent- just across the road from the old town. It was also a 10 minute walk from the trolley/ tram system which easily could take you to the centre of town, 5 for a day pass. We arrived at 10am and they were able to give us a room at midday which was nice. We were in block 8 which was just above the carpark. While convenient, most of the other blocks were in much nicer locations, some rooms with views. I dont know if they were different price as Im sure we had the cheapest option. At check in we were given some 20 off vouchers for the hotel restaurant and a free drink voucher which we used once and was quite nice.Thank you for taking the time to sharing your experience with us!Sounds like you had a great summer getaway. Glad to hear that you also took advantage of our complimentary drink voucher and discount at the Old Town Tequila Factory. Come visit us again soon. Remember, book direct on our official website for the best rates and reservation services we offer. Safe travels until then! Regards,Ryan AguinaldoGeneral Manager
1	First time to New Orleans. Great hotel, very clean, good rates excellent value for the money. They offer free breakfast light evening meal. Rooms were huge with enormous ceilings! I had a room with 2 queens more than enough room. Location was good. I unfortunately had a walking boot on and that made getting around city difficult. Otherwise I wouldn't have had any issues with location. But having limited mobility the location was not the best. My only other issue with the hotel was even with being on 7th floor you still heard a lot of street traffic even at night since its on a major street. Would recommend the hotel just on its value alone.
0	Breathtakingly Incompetent Staff. The hotel clerk checked someone else into our room and we were awoken in terror at 1 am by someone attemping to enter our room (their key opened the door but we had the slide lock closed). Never had a problem with Microtel in the past, but this was so far beyond unacceptable that we'll never stay at one again.
1	Will NEVER stay any where else in San Diego, it's Perfect!. Went to San Diego for a week for my Birthday, So Awesome. Have stayed at the Best Western Lamplighter Inn, on El Cajon blvd, SD. Every time. It is such a great, Clean Friendly well Manicured Hotel, why would i not. It's also perfectly located for everything and everywhere I want to go, everything is close, even the Beaches are like 10 mins away.After all the great things that i experienced staying at the hotel, the icing on the cake, i went to front desk to ask can i print my boarding passes. response: May i do that for you Heck yes, i hate all that stuff, felt like I had my own PA . Thank you Best western Staff, Management and Owner. See you next time.Hello mrbubbles7,So glad you had another enjoyable stay with us. From our housekeeping, maintenance, and front desk staff, we really do appreciate our guests and their satisfaction is of primary importance. Even such things at printing boarding passes for our guests is just one of the many things we are more than happy to help with.Thanks for the great review, and we look forward to your next visit to San Diego!*Book directly with us for Best Selection and Value*Len Regan I General Manager
1	neat, clean and well organized. This property reminds me of being in northern europe. (esp. Sweden and Danmark) Very modern, few frills, and everything clean and useful. We did have our A/C unit go out, and they responded within minutes. When it happened the next day again....they just gave us a new room. Their problem-solving skills exceeded my expectations. A good team with a good system.Our staff will be thankful for your kind words while we hate you had an issue, we are glad we were able to correct that issue and you were able to enjoy the remainder of your stay. Thanks so much for staying and see you again next time!Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations
0	Great staff.....poor motel. If it were not for the motel staff, this would be an inn to avoid. From the moment we arrived for our two night stay in order to visit Busch Gardens, every member of the staff was friendly, helpful, and professional. Each would interrupt what they were doing, either it be cleaning, serving, driving the courtesy limo, to greet you... More
0	Giant Disappointment. We stayed here for 2 nights, and we chose this hotel based on the reviews we read on hotels.com. Unfortunately, the hotel was not what I expected. It was not clean, and was very run-down and dated. The front desk staff members were not pleasant, and one of them was downright rude. Their free breakfast was definitely a disappointment, as it was lacking in quality. I suppose since it was free, there's not much that I can complain about. The food was tasteless, there wasn't enough on hand for all of the guests (except for the cereal) and the breakfast area was very dirty. I would not stay at this hotel again, nor would I recommend it to anyone else.
0	I liked it better as a transient hotel - it wouldnt be on Priceline. Really I know 3 stars on Priceline can be dicey, but really Really We got a quad. Four 5 1/2 foot long bunk beds. Numbered one to four. With a stack of folded sheets. And a 2 by 2 shower. Really How did this get on Priceline in the first place And how did it get any stars I am only writing this now because it is 1:30 in the morning and my dorm was like a library compared to this place. Decades ago. How did this get on Priceline I have stayed at more than 40 hotels in Chicago on Priceline over the years, but this is the first time I have stayed in a hostel. A hostile. Really I wish zero stars was a choice, but that would be too many. I know all the hipster comments I will get on this, but please, keep them to yourself.Hello Steve P, Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to review your stay. I so sorry that your stay was disappointing due to the room layout not being as expected for our star rating. We are reviewing your reservation with our booking partners to ensure that no other guest encounters a similar issue. Please feel free to let our front desk know during any future stays if we can do anything to make your stay more enjoyable. I hope we can see you back again very soon for what I am sure will be a better experience.
0	ripoff. i made a reservation for July 11,2015 and when i arrived to check in they had already given my room to somebody else and said they had no reservation in my name . Bashi Patel your business is a joke and you have been reported to hotels.com and the BBB and i am not through yet!
0	Stay here as a Last Option!. Stay here as your last option! Oldest motel in Ocean Shores. Not cheap either. My junior suite was 140/night. I think It used to be 2 or 3 different motels that they made into 1 resort. I stayed in the 2-story building. I've never stayed here before so I thought I would try it because they accept pets, but I... More
1	Magical stay. The hotel is located on the southeast corner of Walnut and West Katella (opposite of the Disneyland property on the Disneyland hotel side, to the right of the Denny's restaurant). The hotel lobby is located at the front of the property next to the high carport. The lobby looks beautiful, clean, and organized. This is where you get the grab and go breakfast. They do not have a continental breakfast, however you can get a brown paper bag and fill it with granola bars, juice boxes, fruit, yogurt, and pre-packaged pastries. There is also a business center here with two computers and a printer where you can print anything you need for your trip. They also have bathrooms for you to use when you check in. The property also has high-speed free Internet which works very well in the rooms. We stayed in room 204 which is at the back of the property, and our Internet connection was very strong. Check-in time is 3:00 pm and check-out time is 12:00 pm. The hotel is 100 smoke free. If you smoke in the rooms you will be charged 250/night extra. They have free parking and will give you a parking pass for your vehicle when you check-in. Part of the charge when you check-in is a 5/day resort fee. This is a mandatory fee that almost all hotels have. The taxes on the room are 17. The hotel is not pet friendly so don't bring your pet. The property is divided into two buildings the front building is the main building. This is where the laundromat is located on the second floor. The laundromat is open from 9 am-9 pm every day. It costs 2.00 to wash and 2.00 to dry your clothes. The gym is located in the main building next to the laundromat on the second floor. It is open from 8 am-10pm. The main building has an elevator to take you to the second floor. The second building does not have an elevator. The main building has a soda vending machine and ice machine by the elevator on the ground floor. The vending machines here take credit cards and cash as payment. The back building has a soda vending machine, snack vending machine and ice machine in the middle of the building on the ground floor. You can only use cash. Every few doors you will see garbage cans. The property is very neat and clean. There are a lot of plants so it looks lush. The pool is open from 8:00am-10:00pm. The pool is heated and it has a jacuzzi. The pool area is well maintained (cleaned everyday) with a lot of plants around it. It also has a small cabana with a table and chairs and a few umbrella tables with chairs. There is also a vending machine here. Entrances to the rooms are external meaning your door is outside. It's not inside the building. Our room was 204. It is located in the middle of the back building in front of the stairs. It is not a bad room however you can hear the people outside when they are going up the stairs. If you are sensitive to noise, this would not be a good room for you. However, if you're not this room is pretty good since it's located right next to the exit. You can see the Disneyland fireworks from this hotel and the sound they make is loud. So if you have little ones be aware of this. The property is very well lit which can be a problem depending on how you sleep. There is a light right outside our room that is able to shine through the blinds. This took a little getting used. They also have a security officer walking the property at night for your safety. As soon as you walk into the room, you will see a big flat screen HD-TV in front of you atop a 3 drawer dresser. The satellite provider is DirecTV. The pictures crisping clear with very vibrant colors. In front of the TV is the first of the double beds. The bed was nicely set with four very plush pillow's and one body pillow. The bed was firm and very comfortable for me. However depending on how you like your beds depends on how you would like this bed. I slept very comfortably. On the nightstand in between the 2 beds is a small alarm clock and a lamp. In front of the second bed and next to the TV, is a small table/desk. On top of this table is a small data box where you can plug in any of your mobile devices or laptop. It has USB ports and power outlets to charge your devices. On either side of the table, there are plush seats to sit in. They are pretty comfortable. There is also a floor lamp to light up this area. Next to the table and chairs is a small closet that protrudes from the wall. Located inside of this small closet is the ironing board, iron, suitcase stand, and hangers for your clothes. Next to the closet is the countertop where the huge mirror, sink, box of tissue, hand soaps, microwave, single serve coffee maker with packets of tea, coffee, and hot chocolate are located. The mini fridge is located underneath this counter along with an extra towel and the hair dryer. This is now the back wall of the room. The A/C unit is located along this back wall. It is pretty high up on the wall but it has a remote that you can use without having to touch the A/C unit. This is a great feature. The water from the sink takes a good minute to start warming up. There is no safe in the room. Finally the bathroom. The bathroom is small just like in all of the other hotels and it was in good condition. When you flush the toilet, it flushes quick with some strong force. The shower on the other hand has low pressure. To operate it, the handle has 2 knobs. The first knob is round and you rotate it to turn the water on. The second knob has a tab on it and this controls the temperature of the water. Just rotate it to the left or right depending on your comfort level of the water temperature. To get the water to come out of the shower head, pull the little knob that is on the water spout out. They give you towels for 4 people.Thank you for your stay with us at the Best Western Plus Pavilions. We are pleased to know you enjoyed your stay with us. We hope to see you on future trips to the Anaheim area.
1	Wonderful location. We had the King Junior suite for 3 people. This included one King bed and one queen bed that pulled down from the wall. This was a great set-up for us for the weekend. Plenty of room with the queen bed put away. Beds were very comfortable and the room was pretty quiet. The bathroom is VERY small for 3 to share, but fortunately the sink is in the room so that two can be getting ready at the same time. We were there for Labor Day weekend and never saw or heard any protesters down the street. Very easy to walk to catch a bus or BART. Or less than 5 minute walk to Union Square shopping and restaurants everywhere. Swanky bar at the Clift is across the street and a couple of blues and night clubs around the corner.We had an issue at check-out where they charged us more than the reservation showed (happy I printed it out). The desk clerk took care of it right away. They also allowed us to keep our bags at the concierge while we ran around before our flight.Dear bbjj109,Thank you for sharing your experience at Hotel Diva with Trip Advisor. I'm glad you enjoyed your stay with us. I hope you had the chance to enjoy the many complimentary amenities we offer our guests: lobby sake hour from 5 to pm, complimentary Perrier through out the whole day , fitness center, WIFI, business center and our tea lounge on the seventh floor.We hope to see you on your next visit to SF!Best regards,Virgil LopezHotel Manager
0	Avoid this place!. We stayed there for only one night (thank goodness!) a couple of days ago.The reception staff, especially Kris, were good. However, that's where the good ended. The room was dingy and old - paint chipped, moldy smelling, etc. There was something stuck on the edge of the nightstand (pic). The TV remote was disgusting (pic) - I didn't want to... More
0	The website for the hotel said you can be 18 to stay.... The website for the hotel said you can be 18 to stay however when my friends and I arrived we were told that since we were not 21 we could not stay and after 30 minutes of speaking with my mother and nearly working out a solution so my friends and I could stay we were eventually told that unless... More
0	Be forewarned, ceilings are thin... you WILL hear neighbors. While the hotel is clean and in an excellent location, you will NOT get a good night's sleep here if you have neighbors above you who need to fulfill their 10,000 daily steps in the middle of the night. Of the four nights we stayed here all four nights were full of different neighbors above us who for some reason need to walk back and forth around their room ALL NIGHT LONG, banging cabinets, doors, etc. Complaints to the house host were not helpful at all. We never got a decent night sleep here. Also, don't believe the shuttle stuff. We tried every day to get one, first being told just call 10 mins before you need one, then told you must come downstairs in person and wait, and oh by the way it would be a 40 min wait (when the shuttle only goes a 1 mile radius I do not understand). Never was able to get a shuttle the entire time we were there. The staff at the morning buffet were wonderful, friendly, but the hot food was not hot, the selection was small. And lastly, take the stairs. The elevator is S-L-O-W. We often waited more than 5 minutes. I would not stay here again, mostly because of the noise factor.Hello, Julie!Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us. We are sorry to hear that you did not get a good nights sleep - that's the exact opposite of what we are shooting for! Noise complaints are relatively uncommon for us, and we will investigate a bit to see if anything can be done about the particular room you stayed in. I am sorry too to hear of your experience with the shuttle. I know it seems crazy, but with traffic sometimes a shuttle run for several passengers within a mile can take much longer than expected. It sounds like we could have done a much better job communicating with you though. We appreciate the feedback and will certainly use it as a training opportunity internally. Thank you again and we hope to have the chance to serve you again - with a good nights sleep!
0	traumatic stay. My family decided to stay here the night after spending the day at Virginia beach before heading home. The hotel seemed ok and clean and all was well until about 1am. A couple arrived in the room next to ours and were fighting. It got so loud I had to call the front desk and while I was doing this the women was screaming that she was being beat. There was a lot of banging around and the manager along with someone else came up right away. They proceeded to call the police but when they got there the man had already left. This was a very traumatic experience for my wife and kids and management did not even try to talk to us about it. This was not an experience I would expect from a Hilton hotel. I know some things can't be controlled but management should have followed up on this. Based on this experience I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.
1	Lovely grounds, convenient and clean!. The grounds are really pretty, the rooms are very nice and clean. The staff is very nice. The WiFi did not work well in my room. My room was in the 200 building around the back and it was very quiet. I was very impressed about the charges incurred if you smoke in the room- that is a great way to keep all rooms smoke free! The bathroom was very small. One thing I did not like was all the smoking at the pool- I ended up not going to the pool because of the number of people smoking. I also was disappointed that the hotel does not offer a free breakfast.
0	Pay the extra money to stay somewhere else.. The picture on their web site is correct but everything else is garbage. The bathroom had what looked like blood on the curtains. There was people outside drinking alcohol and being loud despite the 40 degree weather with rain. The stairway up to the 3rd floor smelled like urine. Strongly recommend to pay the extra money and stay at a different hotel. Would not take family here.
1	Birthday weekend- hit and miss!. Decided to stay somewhere in the heart of Seattle for my birthday. We wanted a place with a bathtub big enough for two but unfortunately the tub was not big enough for one. Room 2920 was comfortable and had a view towards the west with Elliott Bay in the background. You will hear noise from traffic below. I was also disappointed with the thin bath towels. You'd think a place this nice with these room rates would of offered better, thicker towels. The very large shower had some black mold in spots that contrasted with the white marble. Charging for bottled water seems cheap too. Self serve parking 30/day is a bit steep. Seems to me that they could give guests a discount on the parking fees.
0	Non smoking..Not enforced.. This was at one time and could be again, a great place! Most of the rooms open to the hall and the outside. Problem is, people smoke right out side the doors, and some even left the doors to the halls open, so the smoke went through the entire hall and other rooms. I wondered why the staff never said... More
0	Problems. First of all, the staff was very nice. However, I was very disappointed in this hotel. The rooms are supposed to be 100 percent smoke free, but the smoke smell hit the second I walked in the room. I called the front desk to ask to be transferred to another room but none were available. The front desk kindly offered... More
1	Unique hotel...great staff...centrally located. We stayed at the Zephyr for a week at a really good price and were impressed. The hotel is uniquely decorated and has numerous old-school/classic games in and around it...most with somewhat of a twist. The staff were all tremendously respectful and helpful from check-in to check-out. We brought a small issue with our original room to Lauren and she happily re-accommodated us.The Zephyr is centrally located with easy walking access to a lot of SF's tourist and food spots..it was really convenient.The only negatives I'd say are that the fridge size is deceiving. It looks like a medium sized fridge from the outside but when you open it, the actual fridge is teeny tiny so there isn't much room for stuff. And, the parking was expensive.Overall though, we had a great time and enjoyed our stay at the Zephyr..and we know where to stay if we decide to visit SF again.You certainly got to live like a local, Cecilio L! We love sharing our local go to spots so our guests get the true SF experience, after all that's why we travel! Come see us on your next adventure to the city. Cheers, James
1	Huge Hotel with Open View Layout. Great hotel! The hotel has a great courtyard with a nice seating area. It is in great location to restaraunts, a mall across the street and movie theater down the street. I loved the closed in layout with balconies and visible doors. It was classy and sophisticated with great sections for events and parties. It has a spa, 2 pools, workout room and small food bar for snacks and breakfast. Our room average size clean with up to date technology and a comfy bed. I absolutely loved the way the room was decorated with the colors and lamps. I did wish the room would've had a fridge as we were there for days and wanted water and snacks to keep cold. Considering the open layout it outside noise was not an issue except one time when someone was outside our door having a conversation. Something someone who is interested in booking this hotel may consider is it is a conference hotel and you should ask if there are any events happening. There was a pageant during our stay and it really did become an annoyance. It was constant movement with tons of people in the halls, the elevators continued to get backed up and have alot of wait time and many kids and teens running around. Overall great hotel!I appreciate the feedback and am pleased you enjoyed your stay, hope to see you soon!
0	do not go there. A disaster of a hotel.. one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed at. Could not wait to leave in the mornings. As it was memorial weekend the pickings were very slim.
0	Mildew smell. I found the 3 rd fl hallway smelling like mildew. Breakfast service was poor - ending up going out for breakfast. Hilton is just down the street with a steak house - - will stay there next trip down to Naples.
0	Among the best in San Diego Are you kidding me. We've just returned from a one-night stay at the Lamplighter, which we chose based upon the TripAdvisor reviews and rating. For the first time, Trip Advisor has let us down. I find it impossible to believe that the Lamplighter is the second-highest rated hotel in all of San Diego!It is not great value for the money it is simply an inexpensive motel, with nothing special or remarkable to recommend it. It is located on a busy street in a marginal neighborhood. The lush landscaping of the grounds consists of a few palm trees dotting the parking lot which makes up most of the site, and a patch of grass by the small pool (separated from the parking lot by only an iron fence). We booked a room with a kitchen because it happened to be the best rate available. The room was large in area, but so badly laid out and drearily decorated that it felt cramped and depressing (the kitchen was a total waste of space, especially since it wasn't stocked with cookware or dishes- the cupboards and drawers were completely empty). The furniture was ugly and drab. The room was not well sound-proofed each time our upstairs neighbors took a step, it sounded like elephants were marching across the ceiling. The bathroom was fortunately very clean, but the polyester-blend bath towels were thin and not very absorbent, and left a flurry of lint everywhere. The complimentary breakfast did feature a good selection of pastries, cereals, waffles, juices and fruit, but the pastries were stale and tasteless and the coffee (in styrofoam cups) was bad.The Lamplighter is by no means a dump or a dive it was clean, and the one staff member we dealt with on check-in and check-out was polite and efficient. But it does not by any stretch of the imagination deserve the inflated rating it now enjoys on TripAdvisor.Dear Valued Guest, Thank you for your review about your recent stay at our hotel. We appreciate hearing from all of our guests. These reviews show us not only our areas of strength, but also the areas in which we can improve. TripAdvisor measures only one thing, guest satisfaction. It is not a measure of luxury or location. On TripAdvisor, an economy hotel can score very well and a luxury hotel can score poorly. It is clearly displayed on TripAdvisor that our hotel class is a 2-star (were a AAA 2-diamond property), with amenities and prices that reflect that rating. There definitely are hundreds of luxurious hotels in San Diego to choose from, but at a much higher cost and possibly a lower level of guest satisfaction. Our rating on TripAdvisor is a byproduct of our single-minded dedication to consistent service, quality, and value. We are proud of the ambiance we have created with the space we have available to us. We definitely dont have the grounds that a larger hotel might have, but we have taken great effort to fill our space with colorful plants, flowers, vines, and many lovely palm trees. Its an expense many mid-market hotels arent willing to incur. Regarding your room, it is a kitchen layout that is very popular with many guests staying for long periods as they have full size appliances and plenty of counter space. While none of them are stocked, we do provide full kitchen packs upon request. We do this to protect our guests. We have learned from experience that by keeping the kits in a sealed container, we can ensure that when a new guest arrives, the kit they receive will be clean, complete and in good condition. Im sorry this was not explained to you. Our company culture is to provide outstanding customer service, quality and value to our guests. We manage two hotels in San Diego, we are proud that both are in the top 15 on TripAdvisor. Thank you again for your review. We do appreciate the comments. Sincerely,John LyonProud Owner, Best Western Lamplighter Inn
1	Definitely pleased with choice!. Upon check-in, greeted by wonderful front desk (think her name was Erika). She was so thorough, considerate - walked us through neighborhood map along with restaurant recommendations. Seeing that we were saying for a week, she gave was able to accommodate us by giving a room on the higher floors - 9th floor (which we thought was great attention to service). Was quite thirsty having just arrived, it was great to turn around to see there was free lemon water offered in the lobby! Really nice touch! We also found out later they offer complimentary coffee and tea in the mornings (in the lobby) too!Room met expectation - walked in and was quite pleased. Lovely room decor, nice designer lamps. Although we didn't use it, definitely a beautifully supplied fridge full of soft drinks/water and a nice minibar selection of drinks and snacks. Wifi access was really good! Compared to other hotels I've stayed at, Solamar's internet connection was pretty fast - therefore, more time to relax (instead of just sitting in front of the laptop waiting for page to be loaded). Size of tv was nice and larger than we normally are used to. Also, the remote control itself was CLEAN (meaning, no gunk stuck on it or anything of that sort).Bed itself was slightly on the hard side, though, by the time we finished our day, we were too tired and didn't mind that too much. Good thing was that the pillows were quite nice and soft. Bathroom: it was cool to have it as a sliding door (note: no lock). Amenities - good supply. Shampoo, shower and conditioner is not the mini-sized bottles, rather bottles which are mounted to the tub wall, so well lasts for days ahead. Good counter space where you can spread out all your things. The only thing to really say is about the sink itself. The sink has great visual appeal, though functionally, doesn't work too well, splatter water all over the counter because the sink sits on top of the counter rather than being curved down (if that makes any sense). So, always had to wipe down the counter each time after use.In all, clean modern hotel, which I definitely would be a place to return to for my next San Diego visit!Thank you for the great, and very thorough, review. I'm thrilled that Erika made such a good impression upon your arrival, she is very friendly and fun to talk to. Thank you for your stay with us and I'm glad we had a positive impact on your vacation. Hope to see you again.
1	Should really be a 4*. This hotel was recently opened 7 months ago and used to be a bank. The room was clean, spotless and very comfortable. I was traveling in business and it was smack bang in the middle of centre city with easy access to everything. There was a TV in the room with loads of channels to keep you occupied. The shower and toilet were very clean. The only thing I'd say is for the shampoo and shower gel provided to be fragranced..that's just my preference.The staff were get polite esp Walter and Troy..thanks boys for making my stay welcoming..it was great to chat with you guys and sorry I didn't get to say goodbye properly. I can't comment on breakfast or food as I didn't have this and I don't drink so cannot comment on the bar.Lastly the vibe was really nice and Noamaan, Now that's a headline! We are shooting for 7 stars but there are rules about what defines star or diamond level. Those ratings are related to amenities instead of service. That's why we love TripAdvisor! It provides real stories about real experiences in hotels. Thanks for sharing yours. We appreciate the 5 star review. I will share the shout outs with Walter and Troy, though I suspect they're watching too...Hope to have you back soon!
0	not helpful. This problem happen about two years ago. For my wife's birthday, I had booked a night at The VanLandingham Estate. Granted, I booked it through a through a third-party agent Trivago maybe and it was a deal, meaning discounted. I booked it a few weeks in advance. We were to stay the night and attend a concert. However,... More
0	Just OK. I stayed here several years ago and swore I'd never be back it was really dirty and run down. I saw they had rejuvinated and, becuase most Hilton Garden Inns are very nice, decided to give it another try. They have cleaned it up substantially, but still not the same as every other Hilton Garden Inn that I have stayed... More
1	The room and bathroom were spacious and very nice, very.... Bad: The only thing I wish there could have been is hot food choices for breakfast, such as eggs and bacon or sausage. I did like how they set up the breakfast on each floor. That was very nice, however, having a place to eat outside of our room would be nice. But knowing there isn't anywhere to do that I think you do an excellent job with everything. We will definitely be coming back! Thank you. Good: The room and bathroom were spacious and very nice, very clean and updated. We stayed in the deluxe king room. Staff were all very nice and helpful!
0	To Hot. The room was to hot and no remedy was offered and the service at breakfast was inadequate. At 4 a cup I expect my coffee refilled without having to chase down a waiter. (We were the second customer in the restaurant that morning.) The same is true of water refills.
0	Nasty rooms, MOLD in fridge. We had a pet friendly room, the floor was so gross not vacuumed. My pet ate something off the floor which made her sick. The beds were HORRIBLE. Very loud noise from the highway in front, loud trains in the back.
0	Should have been closed while under construction. Filthy outside grounds with construction debris, cat litter, plastic bags, and garbage. Inside lobby was under construction breakfast was in a storage room with no place to eat. Hotel staff was overheard telling others to Shut your mouth. Reception was not manned had to wait 15 minutes for check-in and longer for check-out before staff arrived..
1	Cute and great location. The staff were super nice and the room was clean and inviting. This hotel is cute and is in a great location. We hadn't been to San Diego before and found that The Pearl is very close to the beach and also to downtown. I would definitely stay there again!On behalf of the Pearl Crew THANK YOU for your mighty fine review. We are honored you chose to stay with us and that you enjoyed how central we were to all the San Diego spots! We hope to have you back soon. Make it a great day!
1	Beautiful Hotel. Great hotel with wonderful rooms. The room service was amazing. The lobby offers a quick shop for drinks and snacks. There is also a restaurant/bar in the lobby. My room had both a tub/shower and a stand alone shower which I must say I have never seen in a hotel room. It was kinda cool. I utilized the shuttle transportation twice during my stay and both times the driver was quick and courteous. Excellent experience.Thank you on behalf of the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport team for your kind comments on our performance. Its so nice to read you loved your well-appointed room and that our shuttle service was convenient for your needs. Ill be sure to share your compliments with my shuttle team. It was a pleasure to have you as our guest, and we hope to see you again soon.Sincerely,Michael GoldwasserGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport
0	Snobby North East attitudes. They charged me 150 for smoking in my room. I do not smoke. There was one person who did smoke in the room, at a wimdow, window were left open. As a non smoker I can smell when a room has been smoked in. The room had NO smoking odor. A small fee for breaking the rules would have been acceptbale. They were unfair about it.
1	An Underwhelming Bed. I stayed one night at this beautiful building in Back Bay. Unfortunately, my particular room had a very uncomfortable bed that was not level. I believe the problem was the mattress itself just being old, not the bed frame. I had to put a book between the mattress and the box spring to level it a bit. Additionally, the room was extremely hot, owing to the radiator being left on while the room was empty. I recommend that the hotel consider keeping the heat off between guests. Otherwise, the facility was great. The public areas are beautiful and the staff were very friendly and helpful.
0	Never again !!. We would have left this hotel immediately, except that it was very late at night, and we just wanted to get a few hours of sleep. We were in room 219. The floors of our room, although probably on a concrete slab, were shaky when someone walked on it. This is the first time I've felt I needed to check... More
1	Great suite for families. We stayed on this time share property thru a family member. We stayed on a corner 2 bedroom suite with views of other casino buildings on the strip. Check-in and out was quick with no lines. Staff members are friendly and accommodating. Our room was clean and has all the amenities for a typical condo time share property. My kids did not attend the children's program /play ground but we always see kids with attendants on the play area every morning from our room. The pool was small and I wish it was larger considering that it is a time share property and most of their guests are families with kids. Parking (valet only) is free which is great considering that MGM properties on the strip charged for parking. My main complaint is the long wait for getting our car. We always waited for at least 15 minutes or longer to get our car. The longest was during our check our which is around 10:00 AM when we waited at least 40 minutes, I guess its the check out time.We are delighted that you found our associates friendly and accommodating. We appreciate your feedback of your stay. Thank you for your perfect review of Marriott's Grand Chateau.
0	Maintenance is not a priority. This hotel is fresh and clean. The bath was spotless--and very pretty. No shower cap provided, though. For a newly renovated property, however, the lack of maintenance is shocking. The television emitted a sharp, prolonged buzz every two minutes or so. The thermostat was either broken or disabled, and since the windows do not open it was stifling. Yes, I... More
0	Great Price, but never again. Okay, let me be clear. I stayed here because I needed something cheap near airport for 8:50 flight. Price was great. That's good. First floor room was adequate, no problem, but lite came through corner of cortain which was annoying. The problems: Noisy hallway. Was woken up twice. Sorry, I guess, but it happens. Biggest problem: left wake up call for six a.m., called front desk to confirm, and added a second call at 6:10. No problem, except neither call came. Woke up at 7. Now that's a problem. Threw on clothing and unhooked my phone from bathroom electric....the socket was dead. Great. Two strikes. Ran through front lobby, and said to desk clerk the problem. She was skeptical and not at all empathetic. She said they have a system that doesn't make mistakes. She is wrong. Dead wrong. Couldn't argue. Ran to car, sped to airport, missed plane. Morale of the story. Stay down the street for 20 bucks more and get woken up on time.
1	Better than I expected. I gave them excellent rating mostly because of the people that work there were so helpful. The place is nice and the room was clean. Bed was great and I slept well every night. Quiet too even though right next to freeway. Had a fridge, microwave and coffee maker in the room. There is a Trader Joe's right across the freeway and that helped with meals. I spent the week there while I visited Comic Con and a shuttle was a few steps away from there. Also full breakfast was included. Food was good. I could not eat the cheese omelette but they looked good. Free Wifi.Dear Marie,We would like to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. Feedback from our guests is very important to us and your input helps with our continuing efforts to provide excellent service and a great stay.Thank you so much for your business and we look forward to seeing you in the future.Kind regards,Laura Benson Operations Manager Quality Suites Mission Valley (619)-881-4000
1	small and swanky. stayed here the weekend of the Rock and Roll New Orleans marathon. The staff were all very friendly and accommodating. The hotel itself was gorgeous, comfortable rooms and huge bathrooms. My main reason for giving 5 stars was the breakfast and inspirational note that the staff put in my room the night before the race. What a great touch.The only thing I noticed that I didn't love was that I could hear the elevators moving all through the night. My room was right behind them though so I doubt this was a problem on the other side of the hotel. I will definitely stay here next time I am in town. :)We appreciate that you took a moment to share your experience. I'm very excited to hear you were so impressed during your trip to the Big Easy! We always strive to exceed the expectations of our guests and I'm proud to be working with such a great team. Thank you for recognizing all their efforts. We look forward to seeing you again for next years marathon if not sooner, the Crescent City is coming up soon!Thank youWayne General Manager
0	Not a typical wingate. Booked a single room with 2 beds. Upon. Checking in the person at the front desk not only informed me that she was putting me in a single King, but that they didn't have any rooms available for the type of room booked. I asked for a refund since this reservation was made over a week in advance. Desk clerk was very rude, refused a refund. Guy I was traveling with had to sleep on a roll away cotDear Mr. Justin K, Thank you for taking the time to give our business the Wingate by Wyndham Atlanta Galleria feedback. I apologize for the inconvenience you experienced while staying at our Wingate hotel. Our goal is to provide a level of service that requires diligent attention to detail and is a matter of constant reinforcement of our hotel. Once again, we are truly sorry for any inconvenience we caused you. If there is anything else we can assist you with in the future, please don't hesitate to call. We look forward to having you as our guest in the future.Tremeil BooneFront Office ManagerWingate by Wyndham
1	A quiet comfort off the beaten path. I requested a smoking room because my hubby likes cigars and was pleasantly surprised by how fresh the room was! I've stayed in higher-end hotels and the hallways and rooms reeked where smoking was allowed! That was not the case at Extended Stay. Admittedly, it's not the most modern hotel, but it was comfortable, staff was friendly, and it was well-kept. My only minor complaint is that you have to request kitchen amenities. By the time I knew that they weren't in the cabinets, it was late and I didn't feel like bothering to request any.
1	Second positive stay at MCO hotrl. This is my second time here just getting a night of sleep for a super early flight. My room was updated and huge with a nice king size bed, a large bathroom, living area, kitchenette, and two TVs. The hotel provides a couple bottles of Dasani water and coffee. Perfect for what I needed. There is a free shuttle to the airport every 30 minutes I had to put my room number down and reserve a slot. It was efficient and the airport was a quick 5 min trip down the road.There is an onsite restaurant and carry ready foods available in the lobby area. The night staff I met were nice.
1	Great place to stay!. My husband and I had a wonderful stay at the Saint Hotel in Key West recently. The room was beautiful, the staff very friendly and helpful. We loved the balcony overlooking the pool. We really think there should be a mirror in the room so that two people can get ready at the same time, rather than having to wait for the bathroom steam to clear before the other person can get ready to go out. We did have to ask for towels and toilet tissue the second day, but the staff were quick to bring them to us. We also received extra hangers when we asked for them definitely needed more hangers! We thought the location was perfect, and the bikes were a treat also. We did lose WiFi, Tv, and music due to some sort of work going on in the street. It all came back on after a while. We enjoyed our stay at the Saint and would definitely stay there again! Jim Lois HoganMr. Mrs. Hogan, thank you so much for taking time our and reviewing our property. We greatly appreciate all the kind words about the hotels rooms, location and staff. I think its a wonderful idea about having a second mirror in the rooms we will definitely take it into advisement because it would enhance the experiment. Should you travel to Key West in the near future we hope you will consider The Saint Hotel Key West as your next residence. Thank You once again
1	Good service and location!. Had a good stay at the W Seattle. Wanted to give a 3.5 rating for this hotel. Good and convenient location. About 15 minutes walk to Pike Place Market and 5 minutes to many shopping stores. Lots of restaurants/dining options nearby too. Stayed in a Spectacular room which were fairly spacious and modern. I liked the Bliss product toiletries in the rooms. There is a Nespresso machine in the room. They didn't have any tea/kettle though. Staff were friendly. Their whatever/whenever service is pretty efficient. Now for some of the cons. The temperature in the room was difficult to regulate. Every tiny adjustment would make the room either too hot or too cold. There aren't enough towel bars or hooks to hang towels in the bathroom. The gym was unkept. Noticed some used towels and opened water bottles laying around. Upon check out, we requested for a bellman and followed up two times and no one came. Ended up bringing everything down ourselves and noticed bellmen in the lobby who apparently weren't aware of our request. They were pretty friendly so not sure if it was just some miscommunication between the hotel staff. Had a good stay but not sure if I would stay here again because I wasn't wowed as much as I thought I would be staying at a W hotel. Might go back to staying at the Sheraton Seattle.Hello Kenneth L, thank you very much for your review of your recent stay at W Seattle. So glad to hear that you had a good stay, but I apologize that we missed the mark on some things for you! Our team works hard here to provide great customer service, so your feedback is incredibly valuable to us to improve those experiences! I do hope you will try us again next time and allow us to WOW you as we should have done this time. Thanks again.
1	Very inexpensive with lots of room. I was pleasently surprised with the quality of the room and it's location. It was quite literally 3 minutes drive time from the Washington Monument and 10 minutes walk time from the metro. The staff was very helpful and the room large. It had a mini kitchen complete with stove, fridge microwave and sink. If I needed an inexpensive place to stay in DC for the week and didn't want to have to eat out every night this would be the place. It's age was showing, carpet stains, peeling wallpaper etc, but the staff was excellent and the rooms very comfortable. No one's home is perfect and this hotel isn't either, but if you are looking for a nice place to stay and can handle it not being absolutely perfect you'll be very happy with Virginian Suites.
1	Hotel Stay. They have great attitude are very nice. very friendly towards people . inexpensive . great for medical trips, business trips , couples vacation, family vacations . they make u feel apart of something. they have excellent service. Wouldn't want to go anywhere else.Thank you for your great review of our property. I am thrilled to hear the staff made you feel so welcomed. Our goal at Extended Stay Hotels is that every guests will experiece a home away from home environment. Thank you again for your review. We look forward to seeing you again, should your travels bring you back to our area.
0	Highly Avoid. The google/website description is very misleading. It is NOT a BB and the term in-room continental breakfast is a joke. The website boasts in-room breakfast of scones and fresh fruit, which really meant cold, (though good when microwaved) scones and two apples. With the owner living upstairs and a restaurant on site it would be very easy and convenient to... More

1	Love the Pearl. If you are looking for a cool adult hotel near the airport (5 miles) and want to feel special this is your place. Our two rooms were retro and clean and we were given free parking, drinks and appetizers with a special. All staff were fun, considerate and food was delicious. We sat outside around a pool with giant beach balls on a perfect San Diego evening watching classic surf films and silent reruns of Gilligan's Island. A Starbucks a block away and you are close to drive to downtown, Oldtown, beach and more.BIG TIME THANK YOU for your review!!!!!! On behalf of the entire Pearl Hotel team we appreciate your support. It's an honor to serve you. Please tell a friend and hope to see you soon.
1	Excellent Service. I spent nine days here and must say the people are the most responsive hotel employees I have ever experienced. The Shuttle service was superb we had them take us to breakfast, lunch and dinner several times each. This resulted from the extremely high prices in the dinning facilities within the hotel. That would be the lone drawback to staying here. Check-in and check-out were quick and easy. Again, the best thing about a stay here is the staff you interact with they are the best!I am glad you enjoyed to stay with us, we hope to see you back soon!
1	Perfect hotel and location. What a great place in the heart of Old Town San Diego. Just minutes to walk to all the attractions, shops and restaurants in old town. The hotel is quiet, clean and comfortable. The staff was outstanding as Bobby checked our bags in as we arrived hours before we could check in. He even called us when our room was ready. Highly recommended. Thank you for taking time to share your experience. We take a lot of pride in hosting visitors and making sure everyone is settled and comfortable. Bobby is an asset and will be recognized for service excellence. Your recommendation is appreciated! Regards,Ryan AguinaldoGeneral Manager
1	Amazing is an understatement.... This is a wonderful hotel that is very luxurious. From the dcor to the staff, it is all top notch. I have never stayed in a Renaissance from Marriot before but I will start from now on when I'm in the Atlanta area. This hotel offer valet parking and free parking as well. Parking is safe and secure and is plentiful. I didn't see or hear any construction going on as posted in previous reviews but I was on the 5th floor.There was dentist convention going on at the hotel during my stay but it caused no problems with staff or other guests. Staff was still attentive and offered a snack to guest. I don't know if it was because I was a rewards member with Marriott or what but it was a nice treat.The room I had was a double queen and it was gorgeous. Rooms didn't have a fridge or microwave so I had to heat up food on the 6th floor near the vending machines. Wasn't that much of a hassle but would have been convenient If I had one in my room. Breakfast was buffet style for 18 which is common for a luxury hotel but I opted for another place on my way out of town.Hotel is across from Cumberland mall and 10min away from Dave and Busters for you adult kids out there.All in all I highly recommend this hotel and will stay again.I am so glad you enjoyed your stay with us! We appreciate your business and the time you have spent to write this review, I look forward to seeing you back at the Renaissance Waverly soon!
1	Best Stay In Philly. Home 2 not only has an excellent location (walking distance to the Convention Center, Reading Terminal Market, China Town, Liberty Bell and South Street.) but is the BEST hotel I have stayed in with-in the city itself. Rooms are very large and clean. The beds are comfortable. I love this place!Not only is this place modern but it's super clean, quiet. Full kitchen including a dishwasher. There is a pod coffee maker with tons of pods to choose from. Excellent coffee bar in lobby and a large breakfast buffet is included.I would definitely stay here again! A++!Dear AngelicVixen,I would like to thank you for choosing the Home2 Suites by Hilton Philadelphia for your recent stay. I appreciate all of your wonderful comments and I am glad you enjoyed your stay with us! With so many choices here in center city Philadelphia, we greatly appreciate your business and look forward to welcoming you back soon, until then...With Hospitality,Jason Bloom General ManagerHome2 Suites by HiltonYour Second Home Away From Home
1	Nice hotel, but a bit remote. This hotel worked very well for a conference .. Very comfortable room, very clean, very courteous staff, and a great restaurant on site with room service. Nice fitness room and pool looked great. A ride brief ride on the free shuttle to OHare, but a 45 min train ride to downtown Chicago. This hotel in walking distance to something interesting would have been a 5. Still, the L train has a stop right there, so if you have more time than I did, the city is accessible. The only irritating downside was getting nickel/dimed for wifi. Still, the staff were top notch and the food was great and the facility is very nice inside (exterior is plain), so it was a very good stay.
1	Solid Hotel in a Great Location. Stayed here with a few friends for a weekend getaway. Nice bar/lounge in the lobby area with a decent sized commissary with snacks and drinks for sale. The rooms were nice and new. We watched some of the NCAA games in our room and the tv was a bit smaller than I would like but it was still a good picture. The location is probably the best part. Its about 3 blocks from Bourbon St which means its a short walk but far enough away not to be impacted by the noise. There still is some construction going on and the pool will not be completed until May, but overall, still a very solid stay.It's always great to hear that we have another satisfied guest! It seems to be a consensus that our location is key to having access to all that New Orleans has to offer yet far enough away to relax peacefully. Thanks, Kristi
0	Unilaterally cancelled my reservation.... I made a guaranteed reservation in October for the Masters golf tournament week, which is held every year in April.

0	Overpriced not clean.. This is not the worst place I've seen.

0	Shouldn't be classified a Sheraton. Ok spacious room. Bed ok not great. No amenities for SPG members let alone platinum members. I had to ask for my welcome gift. Restaurant awful. First warm drinks dusty bottles when having ordered a drink it certainly wasn't cold bottles. Then I was waiting for my breakfast ready to take a shuttle to the airport and the girl said no problem to have an omelet ordered and eaten by the time we had to leave for the shuttle. Well they kept coming back and saying it's almost ready and needless to say it wasn't. I wish she would have saved the trouble and told me to eat the buffet because I left without breakfast. Not an spg property. Won't waste my time staying here again. The Marriott across the way is much better. We always greatly appreciate the feedback of a frequent traveler such as yourself. It is correct that due to the size of our property we do not have an SPG Club Lounge, but offer all other SPG amenities in the Starwood program. You certainly should not have to ask for your welcome gift. We currently have several brand new team members at our front desk and although the SPG program is one of the first training items covered, your feedback allows us to identify need areas. I would also like to apologize for the delay in your breakfast order, which could only have been caused by unusual high volume at the time, which is however certainly not an excuse for not delivering the exceptional level of service that we are known for. We deeply regret the inconvenience we have caused you.
0	bed bugs or fleas? ciggarette smoke everywhere etc. worst hotel ever. do not stay here.
0	Extremely disappointed in just about everything here. I'm a frequent traveler, mostly for business, and stay with Hilton-brand hotels about 90 of the time. I needed a local hotel near a facility I was spending a lot of time at recently, so I chose this Hampton.The rate was nothing to write home about...high for a Hampton in most places (165/night) but it was convenient to where I needed to be.Where do I start The rooms are old and worn...bed quality was fair, at best, with no choice of pillows except for feather-stuffed (I really need something with more support.) The hotel Wi-Fi is probably the WORST I've experienced at any hotel anywhere in the US...constantly dropping signal...poor strength...just really frustrating!And then, to top everything off, my schedule changed and I was able to depart a day early, but because (despite my HHonors status) I checked out at 11 minutes past 3PM...I had to pay for the entire next night. Now, I would have been fine with a late-checkout fee...no problem...but an entire night's cost---just ridiculous and something I have NEVER had happen at any other Hilton-branded hotel anywhere.Just bad all the way around! Very disappointing to say the least!Dear Mike C,Thank you for staying with us and letting us hear your comments concerning your recent stay with us. We are excited to announce that our hotel will be going under renovations in 2016. Our company is constantly adding upgrades and improvements to our hotel to ensure that we stay competitive in our market. Our hotel is currently in the process to complete new installation of the internet service running new wiring throughout the hotel for the new service that will take place in February. We apologize for the inconvenience with the interruption of service during your stay with us. We know that not having a good internet connection is very frustrating and apologize for the inconvenience. Mr. C, In regard for your checking our late on your last day with us I have taken off your charges for the one night. We appreciate your loyalty to our hotel and the Hampton Brand. We hope that when your travels bring you back to the area that you will choose to stay with us again. Sincerely,Patricia Kilgore
1	Good location. Great location off 5 freeway and few minutes' walk (seconds to drive) to park/bay for very pleasant walks which we did after dinner where children were swimming, families picnicing, walking dogs evenings. Hotel staff was great. They went out of their way to accommodate requests, needs etc. Parking at hotel is plentiful and free!I appreciate you taking time to share your wonderful experience here at the Best Western Mission Bay. I am happy to see that our staff was able to accommodate all your requests and you were happy with our location, free parking and staff.When you return to San Diego, please don't hesitate to contact me at 619-275-5700 ext 393 or Lpradohotelpros.biz, I will be more than happy to assist you with your reservation needs.Thank You again for your review,Leidy PradoFront Office Manager
1	WINTER WONDERLAND. This was our 2nd stay at PACIFIC SHORES INN. Last January we visited and booked again this year because we were so delighted with the property. Travelling with two small dogs can be difficult and staying here made it quite easy. There is a reasonable fee of course, but everyone was kind and open to their presence. We had 3 adults staying in a ground floor room with two queen beds. There was plenty of room, the room was clean, there was a frig, coffee maker and micro wave. Great place to travel with young children. Front desk staff was friendly and helpful, housekeeping staff was cheerful and available to help with extra towels, etc. What more could you want from a beach front hotel with the most beautiful winter sunsets off the San Diego coast We wil be back soon!!First, I would like to thank you for taking the time to write this review. I am also glad you enjoyed your stay with us, and of course, your pets are always welcome here. We are one of the few properties that do accept pets and we know many by their names. You also mentioned the sunsets, where everyday is a unique experience!!!! That never gets old, and is one of the perks of managing this property!!
1	Home away from Home. Great hotel for the price. Breakfast and an evening social Monday to Thursday included. Booked on hotels website for 5 nights and payed for room including parking for 134 plus taxes a night. Stayed to be close to AA center which is about a 600 metre walk or the hotels shuttle will drop you off. Used the kitchen in room even baking some biscuits in the convection microwave :) Two very comfy queen beds and also a pull out sofa bed, as there was three of us we could have a bed each which was a nice surprise. We were there the week of Boston Bombings and West explosion so spent alot of time in hotel watching events unfold so on the downside I think this place is so much like a home away from home we probably didnt see as much of Dallas as we would have if the room wasnt so comfortable. Internet connection was BAD BAD BAD in room 422. Very nice touch to add the evening social of nibbles and beer and wine four nights a week. Glad we actually went and checked out in person (we usually dont) as the parking was added to our bill when it had been paid for with the room. All in all a pleasant experience.
1	First class treatment. Stayed here with my husband who attended a meeting and this is where they booked him a room and had the meeting. From the beginning with the doormen being very attentive, to the house cleaning staff being super friendly, to the clean tastefully decorated rooms, our stay was relaxing. We were upgraded to one of the Imperial floors which has a lounge that offers a continental breakfast and evening hor dourves/drinks. This was nice as it was easy to grab a bite to eat/drink. The rooms were clean and modern- had a separate tub and shower. There was a screen on the mirror in the bathroom that had it's own remote but we never were able to figure out how to work it (there were no obvious instructions). Wifi was free and the basic was adequate, although you could upgrade to faster speeds if needed for a fee. The gym/pool was an extra 25 for the length of the stay and we did not partake and chose to exercise outside instead. Nice location- only 1-2 blocks from the Powell Street BART station, in walking distance to Chinatown, the Ferry Building, Fisherman's Wharf. The end of the line for the cable cars is not far either. I would highly recommend this hotel and would likely stay here again.Dear Grch,Thank you so much for taking the time to write a review about your most recent stay with us. It is wonderful to hear that you enjoyed your time at our property, and that you were even able to be upgraded to one of our Imperial Floor rooms! I do apologize that there were no clear instructions as to how the built-in T.V. worked in the bathroom. We are always looking for ways to improve the guest experience, so I will absolutely be sharing your comments with our management team to see if there is anything we can do to make our features more user friendly.Again, thank you for taking the time to share your experience, and we very much look forward to having you stay with us again.Thank you,Dani OrtegaMarketing Manager
0	Extremely dirty and uncomfortable. The floor were so dirty our feet were black within minutes of walking into the room and kicking our shoes off, there was urine on the toilet seat and long black hairs in and on the bedding. The bed was hard as a rock so if you like sleeping on bricks that will be awesome for you. Oh and if you're going to seaworld and want the discounts etc you have to walk next door to a sister hotel but they are only available from 7am-10p. Make sure you get everything too because we did not. The staff did clean the toilet seat and we there was an extra blanket we just used and kept socks on because we were too exhausted to deal with anything else.
1	Just enough for a business traveller. Stayed here for business - the room was large and there was plenty of storage. My room had a mini-fridge that I gleefully utilized for the 3 nights I was there. The most memorable thing about this place was the bed, and the mattress specifically. Hands down the MOST COMFORTABLE mattress I have ever slept on. Plenty of power outlets to charge all my gear, and lots of room to store my clothes. This room could easily accommodate 2 guests. Limo service was onsite for a trip to Hartsfield when I left. Nice place, beautiful inside, large clean rooms, and the upgrade breakfast was excellent. Would definitely stay here again.Thank you for the feedback, come back soon!
1	Friendly staff, large clean room.. We were there for 3 nights and used it as a staging area for sightseeing in DC and Baltimore. It's a nice, new hotel with reasonable rates. The staff was great with our kids, who had a blast at the pool and the 24/7 snack bar. The continental breakfast was great, but they should consider expanding their hours or at least allowing guests to finish the food that is out at 10, because every morning the food was taken away promptly at 10:00 even though the area was packed with guests still trying to get breakfast. Parking was 13/day and right across the street, which is quite reasonable for the DC area.
1	Great Location, Great price, Great Stay!. The St. Charles Best Western, located in New Orleans' famed Garden District offered EVERYTHING we were looking for during a first-time stay in New Orleans. Safe, quiet neighborhood, free parking, great rates, clean, spacious rooms, wonderful staff, and free breakfast. What a bargain!Although the St. Charles trolley wasn't operating due to road construction during our stay, it was just a short drive to the French Quarter, museums, the paddle-wheeler, Natchez, and the Gray Line Tour departure center. Hungry travelers should also know that there is a wonderful Mexican restaurant right next door. It's open late and serves a widely varied menu.
1	Great!. Had a nice comfortable stay here. Great location right on the beach and close to tons of shops and restaurants in the Pacific Beach neighborhood. Also offers easy access by car to anywhere else you want to go. The garage beneath the hotel was never full. Rooms are clean and comfortable. Pool area is nice. Super friendly staff. Would definitely stay here again if we are lucky enough to get back to the San Diego area.Thank you for taking the time to write such a nice review! If you do make it back to San Diego, make sure you're signed up for our newsletter and you're friends with us on Facebook - we frequently post specials in both places! We hope to see you again.
1	Great for travelers!. We stayed overnight before catching a flight out. The hotel was much nicer than we expected, the staff was friendly and our room had a living area and small kitchenette. The rooms were well insulated from noise. They had a nice happy hour (free drinks for guests from 5-7) and a MADE TO ORDER complimentary breakfast that were both great. I would not recommend the steakhouse located in the building. The food was decent, but overpriced and lacking in quality. The hotel also has a shuttle leaving for the airport every half hour. It made for a really nice stay for two weary travelers.
1	Between a Hostel and a Hotel. Traveled solo a few days ahead of a business trip and stayed in Female Quad. There are lockers and a bathroom in the room for convenience as you aren't sharing with an entire floor. The bunks were comfortable, each have a reading light and curtain for privacy.The room is small but definitely space efficient for 2 sets of bunks. If you just need a bed to sleep in and a clean room this is def the place to stay. Freehand as a whole is one of the best hostel's I've stayed in, and doesn't feel like a traditional hostel (many folks staying in the private rooms were in town on business)Location is amazing, 1 block from Red Line and in the middle of downtown makes it easy to get around and enjoy the city. Would strongly recommend and am eager to check out their site in Miami.Hello Adriana H, Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to review your stay. I am so glad to hear you enjoyed your stay and we are honored to be the best hostel you have ever visited. I am so glad our location was ideal for exploring the city and that you found the room to be so comfortable. I hope we can see you back again very soon.
0	Due a refund for roach infestation. The check in clerk told us they had a report of bugs in one room. Turns out they are infested with roaches and the staff is aware of the issue.
0	The only good thing about this place is location. The room is small by Extended Stay standards, dated decor and amenities, no coffee facilities, cleanliness questionable and not a single cup, glass or dish in the place. There were two bottles of beer which was useful but left by the previous occupant.
1	Great place if you're on a budget. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in San Remo. The location is perfect if you plan to hang around the fisherman's wharf area.The hotel is small, as are the rooms, however it has that cosy feel to it. The rooms are cleaner daily and there is an almost constant supply of tea, coffee (plus flavourings and toppings), muffins and sweets, which make for great pre-breakfast or post-dinner snacks.The reception staff were great with us and were on hand to offer help and advice when we needed it. Our only complaint is that due to the size and proximity of the rooms, noise resonates easily. This is not a good thing when the cleaning staff flood the corridors in the morning and talk at an inconsiderate volume. The hotel acknowledges this and provide ear buds next to the beds. I would return here, but will know better than to expect a lie-in in future Thank you for your recent review. We are glad that you found our location, staff and free beverages all day to be a plus for our hotel.Our cozy rooms maintain the same size as when the hotel was built back in 1906. We try to keep the original layout and feel of a historic Inn.Our housekeeping staff has been spoken to and we addressed a memo to them regarding the noise you experienced. Loud conversations by the housekeeping staff in the hallways, especially in the morning, should not be happening anywhere in the hotel. It is with such guest feedback we can make positive changes to the hotel and we really appreciate your honest and positive feedback. We hope to welcome you back soon at the San Remo Hotel.
1	Best deal in downtown Atlanta. I stayed at this Motel 6, 311 Courtland St NE, Atlanta, GA, in August last year for a conference my job would not fund. I was totally on my own dime and so needed to economize. What a great deal this place was! The conference hotel was the Hilton literally next door, and those poor schmucks over there were paying over three times what I paid! For the same location! My room at the Motel 6 was clean, the bed was comfortable, the parking was FREE, AND I had a small balcony off my room on the 2nd floor! The staff was nice - what I saw of them. Granted, the staff at Motel 6 is small - there is no room service, no restaurant, and no bar at Motel 6. But they have all that at the Hilton next door and all over downtown Atlanta so Motel 6 doesn't need it!!! I will stay at this Motel 6 every time I have to go to Atlanta from now on. The location is perfect. I felt as safe as anywhere else I have stayed in Atlanta. What a sweet deal!
0	What a dump.. What a dump. This is a horrible hotel and the customer service is awful we stay in that hotel for a skating competition they tell you was going to get a group rate . when you get to the hotel the price is diferent, try to talk to the maganer few time she say nothing she can do ..she was... More
1	A Little Pricey with Excellent Amenities. This hotel is not as large as some of the 2 or less expensive 3 star hotels. However, the amenities and location along with upgrades makes this an awesome place to stay! This hotel is near shopping and across from a beautiful garden you can indulge in during lunch or a romantic evening walk. Shopping is also inside the hotel with several cheaper places to eat in the connecting building. The staff was excellent and the convention rooms were of good quality. Great hotel for business or pleasure.I hope you feel like you got your money's worth! We really appreciate you staying with us and hope to have you back again soon!
1	Very Charming and comfortable boutique hotel. Amazing Staff!. I cannot say enough great things about this hotel. From the minute we checked in the staff was wonderful, friendly, attentive, helpful. Breakfast in the morning is definately a nice touch with many options for a continental breakfast. Pool/courtyard is smaller than you would think by looking at the photos but has a nice homey feel and we enjoyed overlooking it from our balcony and we also liked how you can use it at night as well. The hotel is a great location where you can walk to anywhere. No need for a car in this city plus parking is difficult and expensive everywhere so just opt out of one and walk everywhere. I would definately recommend and would stay there againThank you so much for your positive review! We love receiving our customers feedback!!
0	Rooms looked clean but I don't think bedding was changed- hairs on it short and bleach blond and I have long brown hair!. NOt a cheap stay in sd but I'll chalk that up to summertime. Hotel or should I say motel needs a remodel. Elevator reeks of urine. Rooms loOked clean enough until I looked in the bath tub where some brown mystery substances resided. Bedding had blond hairs, mine are brown! Fridge very loud kept me up all night. Price paid was to much for quality!Dear Valued Guest, Thank you for investing some time in reviewing the Best Western Plus Miramar. We also thank you for expressing your concerns to us so that we can continue to strive to work hard in providing guests with quality guest service and well maintained rooms that are above brand standards. To hear all the inconvenience that was caused during your stay is disheartening to us. Please know that your concerns are being addressed with our staff so that we are able to improve our services to future guests. Thank you again for reviewing the Best Western Plus Miramar.
0	Not Satisfied. Before I booked this hotel I reviewed comments and rating which indicated I would be satisfied. Unfortunately, I was highly DISAPPOINTED! The hotel elevator had a bad smell, my air conditioner worked best at night, I could hear my neighbors conversation and to make my stay really memorable someone was banging on a hotel door. As for security the hotel has a door that is NOT locked and is located next to the elevator. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL!
0	Not A Happy Experience. My husband and I stayed at Estancia over the Thanksgiving weekend. Thank goodness for our Thanksgiving dinner at Torrey Pines (where we'll be staying next time), or the weekend would have been a complete loss.Noise: The builders sure made a lot of money on this one, because the walls must be made of cardboard. You can hear your neighbors above and on the sides, you can hear everyone in the hallway (even when not directly outside your door), and you can hear TVs, heating and a/c from all adjoining rooms as they rumble through your room and ripple through your ceiling and walls. If you must stay here, insist on a top floor room (3rd Floor, I believe) to minimize overhead noise.Room Size: Hardly the square footage promoted (300 sq ft). You practically bang your knees on the armoire (TV set holder) as you pass by the foot of the bed. The hallway is a total waste, and the patio is a joke.Room Furnishings: There was a huge stain on the lampshade there was no lamp or light provided in the area of the suitcase dolly, so you rummaged in your bag in the dark. The TV was so very small and made a huge buzzing sound if it was muted. No regular blankets were provided, just sweat making, hot acrylic ones. Only 3 towels and 3 pillows were provided for 2 people. The bathroom light could only be turned on with the fan, which was so loud (I mean really loud) that a relaxing bath was impossible unless you wanted to bathe in the dark.Dining: In the restaurant, we asked what time dinner was served. We were told half an hour. In the bar, we ordered a drink in the bar. It never arrived. We went back to the restaurant half an hour later. We were told dinner wasn't being served for another half hour. Having already been given incorrect information once, we checked with a third restaurant employee who told us that dinner was not for another hour. Two wrong answers and an undelivered drink - that's how we ended up at the Lodge at Torrey Pines.Pool/Jacuzzi: The area was a mess, there were no towels, and there was no one from whom to get towels.Just Plain Tacky: The 17 parking charge, the 9 Hospitality Fee.Save your money for any other resort or hotel. There are tons of good ones in San Diego this is definitely not one of them. (P.S. - Sorry for the lag time between staying and reviewing. We moved, and I just unpacked my two pages of notes on our vacation.)
1	Friendly funky and really central. Great location, room very clean, bathroom small but the room was huge with a full size pull down double for our son and a king for us, plus room for a coffee table with 3 chairs. Nicely decorated. Friendly staff especially concierge who is a real character but really helpful and friendly. We got a room on the 7th floor opening out onto a central tiny courtyard/well so no view but no street noise either which was very nice. No more homeless people outside than anywhere else so no problem there. Easy walk from Union square 2 blocks and a manageable walk from BART on Montgomery even with cases, we left our car with friends in Berkely to avoid the cost of parking. Caught the street car to FIshermans Wharf but got a taxi back to the hotel which was only 11 and well worth it as it got very cold and we were really tired by then. Starbucks in the lobby and a great takeaway Thai noodle bar 2 shops away. Would definitely stay again.
0	Great service from Staff but the hotel needs an update. The staff was courteous, friendly and helpful. However, the hotel itself seemed to be a hodgepodge of various updates through the years. It seems staff has been trained to blame it on Katrina but when you stay its clear that the owner has not sufficiently maintained the facility through the years and when maintenance was performed, done so at the cheapest cost no matter how unsightly. the hotel has a lot of potential but is not a boutique by any stretch of the imagination. the windows are original so they are thin. curtains did not properly open and close. AC was loud and inconsistent at keeping a steady temp. using an old mercury thermostat. continental breakfast was paltry compared to others hotels.Dear Josephcarter2018,Thank you for taking the time to review our property. I apologize that your stay fell short of our high service standards. We truly consider all feedback to be a critical part of our success. We pride ourselves on the high levels of service provided to our guests and I am very sorry to hear that was not the case during your stay. Your honest feedback is greatly important to us as we continue working to make improvements and please rest assured that your comments have been heard and passed along to senior management. Thank you again and I truly hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back to visit again in the future.
1	The only place we'll stay in La Jolla. I've visited San Diego area several times. This time, my parents came with us for two nights in La Jolla. My father has limited mobility, so proximity to the ocean and good view from the room were of paramount importance. Pantai Inn is about 5 min walk from La Jolla Cove, where you can go watch adorable seals/sea lions lounging the hotel is far enough from the Cove that you don't hear their nocturnal squawking or smell them.We stayed at a 2 bedroom suite with full ocean view at Pantai Inn. The rooms were luxurious, renovated, comfortable, and meticulously clean. The fully stocked, modern kitchen with a large dining table was perfect, as we ate our dinners watching the sunset. The open air lobby (with a variety of tea, coffee, and daily freshly baked cookies), well-tended gardens, fountain, fire pit, and dining area were all wonderfully decorated with thoughtful small touches. All the staff members we had the pleasure of meeting were accommodating, courteous, unobtrusive, and efficient. Daniel (I think that was his name, apologies if I'm wrong) cordially led us on a tour of the 2 bedroom suites available and let us choose at check-in (1st floor vs 2nd. We chose the 1st floor to minimize navigating the stairs. It also has a sunroom and a more open layout. The view is better from the 2nd floor. However, there is no sunroom in the 2nd floor suite). There was a fresh fruit tray waiting for us upon our arrival. We even received beautifully decorated, delicious mini cakes once the staff members found out that my parents were celebrating their 40th wedding anniversary. It was truly thoughtful and made our stay even more special. We looked forward to delicious breakfast every morning. The daily menu was placed on our fridge the night before.We've made wonderful memories here. I can't thank the Pantai Inn staff enough for giving us a trip to remember forever. This hotel offers top notch service in perfect location for those who want a quiet, luxurious getaway.Greetings CurrentlyReading, Thank you for taking the time to review Pantai Inn. You illustrated a beautiful picture of what it is to be a guest at Pantai Inn. We VERY diligently do our very best to ensure that both our returning as well as our first time guests have a memorable experience with us. We have flexible accommodations and we can usually meet everyone needs first floor, second floor, ocean view, two bedrooms, three bedrooms, you name it we can usually deliver. Thank you for outlining the wonderful staff interactions that you had. We truly do have a remarkable team. Each of them give all that they can and do their best to ensure our guests are comfortable. Also, I wanted to let you know how much I appreciated your pictures. Often times, travelers get the impression that images that hotels share are not the true photos from the hotels. Your images capture the essence and care of our Inn. We are looking forward to ensuring that you next stay is just as memorable as the first. Looking forward to seeing you again soon!Mike
0	Not too accomodating. the hotel has a cool vibe, there is no where to eat breakfast in the hotel so that's an issue, I had a problem with the reservation and was not accommodated on my request so that's impacted my experience after the fact. San Francisco has a huge homeless problem and unfortunately that impacts the surrounding area, I was disturbed by the number of homeless people sleeping on the street in front of the hotel so consider that before booking
0	UNDER CONSTRUCTION!!. Hotel is refusing to let people know that rooms are being upgraded which means that there is non-stop construction noise in the hotel. Theyre charging top dollar and putting you in a room with construction noise going on continuously throughout the day. Ridiculous and unacceptable.MoreDear Ruben O., thank you for sharing your feedback regarding your recent visit with us forgive us for not sharing our re-imagination project with you as our guest rooms are receiving a brand-new look feel it is always our intention to be transparent and...More
1	Excellent stay!. Stayed at the W Seattle hotel for 2 nights and had an excellent experience. It was my first time staying at a W hotel property and am definitely going back. From the first point of contact at the front desk (I think the woman who checked us in was namedMikala), to the restaurant staff, and housekeeping - everyone was so welcoming and kind. The rooms were very modern and clean. Good amount of space and great amenities. Hotel is conveniently located within blocks of Pike Place, restaurants, and shopping. I prefer to not stay too close to Pike Place because of the crowds. Starbucks is located right across the street, which is great if you need coffee every morning. Not sure when I'll be back in Seattle, but I'm definitely staying at another W property soon. Thank you for your comments Elisa, I will share them with our talent at the Welcome Desk and Trace Restaurant. We do hope your travels take you to Seattle again soon and we are certain you will enjoy your next W Experience as well.
0	Rude and stinks. Rude clerk at check in. After a long wait! Room had terrible smell. Room had no soap. Ov erall room very poor compared to other 5 star hotels. Long walk to parkinging. Unfortunately front desk experience along with smelly room makes this hotel a no stay
0	Do not stay here.. Jake at reception is an amazing guy and wifi works perfectly! But the rest of the hotel is a mess. Rooms smell, the woman at reception kept me waiting outside the lobby for 10min while she decided to open the door. Hair in the sheets. Ice machine makes so much noise you can't sleep. Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else.Dear Arturo, Thank you for sharing your review. We strive to provide a comfortable night's rest and are disappointed your stay was unsatisfactory due to the odor concern you describe. Please know that the conditions you describe are atypical to Motel 6 standards for quality and we apologize for the inconveniences you experienced. Our standards for quality rest on the promise to offer the lowest price of any national chain by delivering the essential elements of a comfortable room for a satisfying stay, for this reason we apologize for the disappointment you describe with the expectations of amenities.

1	Recommend! Staff is very welcoming!!! Will stay here again!. On a two day layover to see my grandkids I stayed here in one of the King suites. I had originally booked a different cheaper hotel (Country Inn) but when I walked in to check on the rooms I decided to look for something else that also had an indoor pool since the CI suites had no window in the Living area. The space there was also very small. I am so glad that I then found the Drury Inn!! The atmosphere in the hotel was perfect for us. Friendly staff!! Yes the rooms were older but they are well equipped, very large and very comfortable. They are not at all nasty in any way so I do not understand the complaints from others. For the price you just cannot beat this hotel!! Lots of food - breakfast with lots of choices, snack in the afternoon (popcorn and free soda) and a food bar in the evening including FREE drinks. Simple foods but VERY acceptable! WE ALL HAD A FUN TIME HERE. The tween grandids really enjoyed the HEATED POOL. This was also a convenient enough location to make a midday trip to the fabulous Aquarium too. We did have a problem with our neighbor smoking in their room although this is clearly stated on signes throughout the hotel that this is a NON SMOKING HOTEL . Since the vents are connected in the rooms we were smelling the smoke. Both the grandkids are allergic to smoke and it really hurts my sinuses too. The staff moved us to our choice of a new room (not sure why the exhaust vents in hotels are now connected but just saw that in a Hilton I stayed in recently too). I will certainly stay here again on a quick layover to Atlanta. + FREE PARKING and FREE WIFI too!
0	Horrible and tacky. Horrible tacky room. We were upgraded to the Romance suite. Upgrade Romance Really It was New Year's Eve and they gave us a bag with complementary champagne and chocolate. Nice thought but champagne was so cheap, it was like vinegar with bubbles. Glad we took our own. We opened the door to enter the suite and it smelled horrible.... More
1	An awesome hotel in a great location. Our regular hotel during marathon weekend was all booked, so we stayed here and we were very impressed. This hotel is beautiful and newly renovated. The staff is extremely friendly, check in and checkout was seem less. Its a great location in the city, conveniently located to the town hall, reading terminal market and other great downtown locations. Dear shelltravelstheworld,Thank you for sharing your wonderful experience at the Courtyard Philadelphia Downtown. We are delighted to know you thoroughly enjoyed your time with us and that our outstanding hospitality and convenient location made it even more memorable. Thanks once more for allowing us to be of service, and we hope to have the pleasure of doing so again on your next trip.Thank you,David KiddAssistant General Manager
0	False advertisement on shuttle service.. The hotel's complimentary shuttler service to Google HQ and SJC airport is very unreliable. Once I was told to wait for at least 2 hours. Once the service was completely unavailable. Once they booked me a taxi without any notice or authorization due to shuttle service unavailable and the pay was on me. The front desk was handling my complaint... More
0	American Horror Story. The Chelsea itself seemed very nice even thought I didn't stay in a room there. As you walk through the Chelsea and into the Annex you get a totally different feel. It goes from semi-upscale to the creepy part of the hotel in American Horror Story. The beat up squeaky elevators to dimly lit hallways and the sketchy bright red lights on every floor it screamed AHS. On the positive side the price was great for a Friday night and it was just a really short walk to the Trop. Next time I would pay the few extra dollars and stay at the regular Chelsea not the Annex.
0	Switch and Bait. asked for a ocean view, did not get but paid full price
0	Not for short stays!. I should have read the fine print but I'm used to places where extended stay also means that short stays are what you'd expect at any hotel. Not! The rooms are very utilitarian, not at all what I'd call cozy. Reminded me of a college...More
1	Service was amazing from the time we walked in. From the time we walked in and greeted by Frank we knew it was going to be an amazing place. Frank gave us some local tips and Ed escorted us to our beautiful room making sure we had everything we needed, bringing us extra water and suggesting places to eat. We were there for 2 amazing nights, shame we didn't take as much advantage as we could have being.located in the shopping plaza..... So so many shops. Courteous, friendly staff. Service impeccable, in fact we rushed in after a full day had a quick shower before meeting friends, returned and found fresh towels! Amazing
1	Great place and reasonable. Very clean and close to everything San Diego has to offer.Close to the freeway for access to everything. The restaurant had good food where we dined for breakfast and dinner on a few different occasions, Patrick was our server and was very accommodating and personable . The room was very clean and had everything we needed to make our stay enjoyable. The price was more than reasonable and we will stay there again if we are in the San Diego area.Dear Bradstaaf,Thank you so much for your great comments! We are so happy to hear that you appreciated the cleanliness of our property and rooms as well as the value you received. We are glad that you were pleased with our convenient location with easy access to the freeway and close to all that San Diego has to offer. We are also glad that you liked our Seven Seas Caf for both breakfast and dinner, and that Patrick took care of your needs in a personable manner. We will be more than happy to pass the kind words on to him! Thank you again for taking the time to review the Best Western Seven Seas and we welcome the opportunity to be of service to you during your next visit to San Diego. Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management Staff
1	Excellent Service!. Hotel was quiet, comfortable and priced right. Kind of felt like staying with family!! The staff was very helpful but Derek was fantastic! Went way above and beyond to make sure our stay was great. He even went as far as to volunteer to pick us up at 3:50AM to get us to the airport for a flight home. Thanks again Derek!! I would definitely stay again.Hi Kat19526, isn't Derek the best he is a great asset of our property along with the rest of our staff, it takes a team effort and each one are recognized with rewards for getting their names mentions by our guests. He I both appreciate your recognition. We look forward to serving you again if you return to Orlando. Thank You,Hotel Manager
1	Close and Convenient. Whether renting a car or needing a shuttle, this hotel is very convenient. A Wawa and Ruby Tuesday's are within walking distance. It is a bit pricey, but for me the location was worth it.The room was quiet and the beds were comfortable. The free breakfast was average free breakfast fare. Since our room was not ready on time, we got 1/3 off our cost... making it a great deal.Thank you so much for telling us about your recent experience at our hotel. We are so glad that you had a pleasant stay. We strive everyday to exceed our guest expectations. We look forward to serving you and your family in the future!Thank you for making it the Hampton Inn By Hilton Philadelphia Airport!Adrian Woods, Director of Sales
0	Modern hotel but poor service. This is my first tripadvisor review and I feel I need to share my experience. The hotel and room is renovated and modern but we were assigned to an accessible room on first night which layout made us feel uncomfortable. They changed to a standard room for us next day but that room was not cleaned yet after we came back from the beach at 8pm and they wanted us to wait 30 minutes for the room to be cleaned because they did not have other room available. The guy (I forgot his name but he made me feel like lacks of experience) at front desk kept justifying it is their system issue (which means ok for customer). Even after room cleaned, we found hair on the bed and pillow smells and they only put 1 glass in our room. I choose Hyatt Centric because of their location, modern design and the quality of Hyatt (used to be), but this experience made me disappointed. Their staff definitely needs more training.Hi Brian C,Thank you for sharing your review of your stay with us in Waikiki. We apologize for the inconvenience with your room assignment. We are in one of our busiest seasons and the hotel can regularly be at capacity. We have followed up with our team to ensure we are streamlining all of these processes and we hope to have the opportunity to serve you again in the future so we may demonstrate the excellent accommodations we are known for in Honolulu.
0	Awful dirty motel wouldnt bother. This was the dirtiest and worst run hotel we've ever stayed in. It was so dirty we had to leave early and find alternative accommodation. Sticky carpets, dirty linen AC and fridge not working. Changed rooms but no improvement - no way could this be a 3 star hotel
1	GREAT. What a wonderful hotel!!! 5 nights in a room with a great view over the Gardens with hills and sunset in the background. Service is over the top. I think St. Regis has figured out how to know what I want before I do. The food in the restaurants was very good. Concierge staff knew their stuff - great recommendations for places to walk, restaurants, etc. Surrounded by nice museums. We had a great stayDear Guest,We appreciate your review on your most recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco. I am pleased to hear that you had a wonderful experience at our hotel. It also delights me that our associates delivered uncompromising and bespoke service to you during your visit. Thank you for your feedback and we hope to host you again upon your next trip to San Francisco.Sincerely,William FongHotel Manager415-284-4057
1	The nicest attitude from the Manager to. The nicest attitude from the Manager to front desk and room assistance. The shuttle driver was pleasant and very helpful. Not only did he suggest places to eat, and take us to the place of our choice, it was the best Italian restaurant ever. He also made sure we saw the Memorial to the bombing victims both in daylight and after dark. Not to be missed!! Room was clean, fresh, completely stocked with amenities, and the bed was comfortable. I look forward to finding a reason to go back to Oklahoma City and the Knights Inn at Bricktown Hotel.
1	NEW ORLEANS CHARM IN ALL ITS GLORY. This hotel is charming, quaint and has all the comforts of home. The pool area is so exquisite. The location could not be more perfect, within walking distance of everything, but just far enough away from the noise. We stayed there just before Christmas and the lobby, although small had such a cozy feel and the hot chocolate served in the late afternoon was a real treat. Breakfast was however limited in selection. All the staff were extremely helfpful. The parking is extra and is expensive, but all hotels in big cities charge addtional due to space limitation, add it into you budget. We do however wish that they had two queen beds instead of two fulls which is just too small to share other than that we give the Bienville House an A+
1	Pros and Cons. Stayed here overnight when a flight got cancelled. PROs - Great Staff, Clean, Close to ORD. CONs - Charge for Wifi, No breakfast, Cost.First the pros - my wife left her credit card in the room. After discovering two days later, she called the hotel. The card had been found and turned in and locked in the office safe. The director of security verified the info and shipped via Priority Mail back to us at no charge. This is unprecedented service and one we'll be forever thankful for. The room itself was exceptionally clean and well-appointed. Also, it's only about a 7 minute drive to ORD.Negatives - 12.95 charge for wifi is ridiculous in this day and age (I'm guessing because they can) there are relatively no restaurants around except for the wonderful Gino's East next door. Also, the cost was a little out of line for a close airport property.Dear Gatoric:Thank you for writing about your stay with us. I am happy to hear we were able to hear that we found your credit card and that you enjoyed the staff..Like most full service hotels of a major brand we do bill for services such as breakfast and internet separately from the guest room. From your note I gather that you prefer to have all inclusive pricing when you choose a hotel. There are a number of Marriott brands that will perfectly meet your preference such as Courtyard Hotels, Residence Inn and Springhill Suites. There is a Residence Inn near O'Hare as well as a Springhill Suites (which is located just 1 mile from our hotel.) I can recommend all of them. Thank you for staying with Marriott! Wishing you a pleasant summer. Dieter Heigl
1	Friendly Boutique Hotel. From the moment I arrived, I received superior customer service from the person who opened the door to the hotel to the front desk staff and that never changed. I requested a quiet room, so they put me in one that faced a brick wall to another building, but this was far superior to not being able to sleep due to street noise as other reviewers mentioned. The room was nice, clean and quaint. Comfy bed. Free WiFi, which worked well. Free coffee tea. The location was perfect for my needs - I was on business attending a conference two blocks down (Moscone Center area). And, there were some great restaurants nearby too. I'd definitely stay again!
0	Wouldn't Stay Here Again. Good location, but DIRTY hotel! In my opinion, it should be DOWN-rated to a 2-star hotel. It's OLD, the room I stayed in smells musty, and the common areas were DIRTY!
1	Amazing Customer Service. We were looking for a hotel at the last minute. As soon as we walk in the staff were very courteous and friendly, very helpful in finding the best pricing and fulfilling my hotel needs. I was serviced by Davian, she was very willing and helpful. I commended her for the outstanding service she provide. Next time we visit Key West this will be our place to stay.Dear Catherine A,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. We are Happy to see that you enjoyed your stay with us and that our staff was very courteous and friendly. It is always nice to see our staff mentioned. We hope to see you back in Key West soon!Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager
1	Fantastic place for families!. Decided to go with this hotel after seeing it was the best rated for families on TripAdvisor. I would agree wholeheartedly. Location is excellent. Included breakfast is excellent. The rooms are excellent - having the suite allows you to close the door and let the kids go to bed without having to sit in the dark. Full fridge, microwave dishwasher, sink, table so you can easily keep milk/food for the week or just get takeout and eat in the room when you can't face another night of waiting for a table with hungry kids.The valet/concierge staff was the best I've ever experienced. They were all extremely nice and helpful, it was the same crew every day so we felt comfortable with them and most importantly, they very friendly to kids. Especially a man named Adbul - he remembered our kids (4 and 6) every time we came in or out and joked around with them, which made them feel very special.Room was clean and well maintained. To be honest and objective, the first day we were there there was a hair on one of the towels which freaked my wife out, but I didn't think it was a huge deal and it didn't happen again. We had to call for extra towels every night instead of them just leaving them for us when they cleaned the room, but they always brought them up right away. But these are minor points - overall excellent.The pool is on the 19th floor with big windows with city view. The kids were excited but with the sunshine it felt like a sauna so we didn't spend time there. But it was as nice as any hotel pool I've seen.Read the comments about the fact that they only have 2 elevators which caused some people delays, but I have to say we didn't experience that at all - the elevators always came right away even during peak times.Shuttle to Navy Pier drops you off right in front of the hotel. We walked into Phil Stefani's Italian restaurant around the corner and while it was a higher end restaurant, they welcomed us with our kids in our shorts and we had a great meal.The hotel is right across from a hotel with great shopping. Highly recommend the Lego Store. We went to the Legoland play center in Schaumburg the next day (highly recommend) and you can buy tickets at the store in the mall for a great discount. Saved us 28. Easy walk to Michigan Ave. My wife and daughter did the whole American Girl thing and had a great time.Overall a really excellent hotel that we will definitely stay at again.
0	Dont expect much for the odor.. We had a bad odor and the bath room needed fixing. We talked to the front desk and nothing was resolved. They where over booked, and could only promise some one that never showed. It was so late they couldnt find us a room locally. So bring your own spray and Plummer. Bring your own breakfast too.. the food was stale and cold unless you special order your breakfast for 13.00 a plateHello dougchilton:We are very sorry for the condition of your room when you arrived. We work diligently to make sure all of our rooms are perfectly clean and working properly upon check-in, and we obviously fell short in your case. Your feedback will be shared with the housekeeping and maintenance team so appropriate measures can be taken to keep such mistakes from happening again. Although we did not meet your expectations this time, we hope you will consider our hotel on your next visit to Orlando so we can better deliver the experience you should always expect from us. Sincerely, Michael GoldwasserGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport
1	Great Hotel. Great hotel, great location. Win.Win.WinThe lobby bar and tenders super phenomenal with crazy yummy cocktails. The sushi bar is also a wonderful experience, talk about fresh and tending to your every wish.Super quick walk to Ferry terminal and Union Square. Have stayed in San Francisco many times and this will now be my hotel HQDear Guest,Thank you for taking time to share your recent experience at The St. Regis San Francisco. Providing memorable experiences is what we take pride in, so we are happy to hear that we created an enjoyable stay for you. Your kind words are greatly appreciated and we hope to welcome you into our doors in the near future.Sincerely,William FongHotel Manager415-284-4057
1	Great Holiday. We had a terrific view of the ocean and beach. The room was big, the beds and pillows was comfortable. The only problem was the fan in the shower/toilet room was extremely noisy, the toilet was too close to the toilet paper dispenser and there wasn't enough counter space for our toiletry items. We had to leave most things in our toiletry bags and use the items from them. Otherwise, the room was great and it was nice to hear the roar of the ocean every night. All staff was very friendly however we were told that there would be a concierge who would sell us tickets for the whale cruise but we never saw a concierge for the 2 days that we were there. We went directly to the cruise ticket office instead. We will probably stay there again if we go back to Virginia Beach.
0	Disapointed!. Stayed overnight after seeing Rascal Flatts concert. Clerk had personality of dry white toast. Not mean or disrespectful, just not particularly friendly. The elevator smelled like a sewer pipe, as if a sewer main had busted and was discharging into the elevator shaft. Room was decent size but bed horribly uncomfortable. Lumpy and right side sagged so bad my wife almost rolled out of bed a couple of times. She is a petite girl, so it wasn't weight or anything, just a worn out mattress! A couple of extra pillows would have been nice, but didn't ask for them so can't really fault the hotel there. The window to the room was literally the wrong size (too small for the opening) so a nice COLD wind blowing into the room all night that the heater struggled to keep up with. End result was room was too hot or too cold, and the heater dried out the air so badly trying to keep up with the cold blast from window, we both had bloody noses in the morning. Not impressed overall. Will pay the extra 20 bucks to stay at the Courtyard next time!
0	Front Desk Lack of Training!!. I read many bad reviews about this hotel but I didn't believe all the bad customer service comments BUT what just happened to me few minutes ago it's unbelievable! I'm in room 2110, it's midnight as I'm writing this message. I was just woken up by a couple who opened my door as they said the front desk just checked them in and they were given the same room.......Is this for real I been here for 3 out of 4nights already and they checked in other people into the same room, who is running this hotel I am Starwood Gold, I recommend staying somewhere else do not say here...don't make the same mistake I made to not listen to other reviews. How can you trust this hotel after what happened to me Anyone could have been checked in while I'm away and to my return personal items could have been missing....who's to blame I know, the 3 star hotel!!Mynor,Thank you for letting us know about your stay. We apologize for the issue that you had at our hotel. We are deeply sorry for the situation that you encountered with you room. Please feel free to contact me directly in regards to this matter.
1	Relaxing Spanish Getaway. My husband and I are staying here (We are still here, I just couldn't wait to write this review. I even created a new account on TripAdvisor because I couldn't recover mine from years ago) with our 2 year old and I am 8 months pregnant. We wanted to have a relaxing, quiet stay in La Jolla and originally heard of Estancia through JetSetter on Gilt.com I am thrilled that we chose to stay at Estancia. It is absolutely beautiful here and very tranquil. My 2 year old loves walking the grounds and everyone has been so friendly with him, even though this isn't exactly a perfect place for children. My son is very calm mannered and we thought it would be okay, especially after seeing on different review sites that they are so welcoming of families and young ones. The salt water pool feel amazing on your skin and the cabanas are very chic and well maintained. The restaurant that is open in the evenings has amazing food- upscale mexi-cale comfort food and other choices. The one time we had a real problem with a dessert being sent up to our room 45 min later than ordering it, they sent up a fresh dessert right away, took off the charge, and added about 10 more scoops of ice cream that we didn't ask for :) It was a nice touch.I am definitely coming back here- My husband loved that we were so close to Torrey Pines GC and wants to stay for golf next time. Absolutely serene. Thank you, Estancia La Jolla!!It is simply wonderful to read all about your experience with us so far! We are so happy to read we have been able to help you and your husband have such a relaxing stay and that you have experienced nothing but to top-notch customer service throughout. We are so thankful you took the time to share your stay with the Trip Advisor audience, and your kind words will certainly be shared with the entire team! We hope you continue to have a lovely time, and we can not wait to welcome you and your family back again in the future.
0	Dirty, black mold, Awful smell. Worst hotel experience of my lift. We are campers who do not require amenities and state of the art anything. BUT we do expect clean. There was black mold under the window sill in room 204 which was exposed by the peeling wallpaper. Not sure if the hotel owns a vacuum. The bed underskirt was dirty. Lamp broken. Shower rod... More
0	Nice location, dog friendly but old and in need of renovations. The Polynesian Resort is located at the end of the strip of hotels along the ocean front. You are within walking distance of the main business corridor and about a 1/4 mile from the beach. All hotels are that far off the beach so this isn't something specific to this hotel. The hotel has a pool, spa and sauna on... More
0	Unkempt. The room was covered in boxwood beetle bugs, both dead and alive. While I understand there was an infestation in Ridgecrest, I would think the cleaning staff would be sure to vacuum at least the dead ones and attempt to get rid of the live ones. I told the office staff and they were nice, but just repeated that there... More
0	So unfriendly and disappointing.. We were really looking forward to staying here. Unfortunately it was surprisingly disappointing. The room itself was very large and picturesque so we cant complain about this but the noise from outside made sleeping impossible some nights. The windows are obviously not double glazed so the noise from sirens was incredibly loud as they went up the street right outside the window. Also no television in the room. I think thats a must now. We dont watch a lot but the option would have been great. Mostly though accommodation is about the people and we felt like intruders in someones house. No good mornings or how was your day when we came in. We realise it was not a hotel so dont expect that level of service but a hello would be nice. Such a shame its in a great location. Sally,I am sorry to hear that you felt unwelcome here at The College Club. We do try to greet guests daily and are always available in person, or by telephone after office hours, to hear and address concerns. We appreciate you bringing your concern to light here and will work to do better in the future. It is true that the noise from outside can, at times, be unsettling. It is an unfortunate fact of being situated on a major thoroughfare in a populated area. Some guests are accustomed to it, some are not. Had we known of your trouble sleeping we would certainly have moved you to a room on an upper floor or away from the street. There is a television in the breakfast room which guests are welcome to use at any time day or evening. We do hope that, overall, your trip to Boston was enjoyable and would welcome the opportunity to have you as guests should you return.
1	convenient in downtown LA. Bad: I understand it is a japanese hotel but the American breakfast was terrible. I appreciate that they had all options, but the eggs weren't well cooked, the bacon wasn't cooked and for that it was expensive. there is no room service and for the hour i had to be at my conference it was hard to get out extra early to find a diner nearby. some didn't open in time. It was a buffet so super fast... I also don't eat alot of the other things they offered like the toast etc... and they had a full spread of what i assume would appeal to foreign visitors which i think is also great and nice for them. Good: it was very conveniently located to my conference across the street... Not the most luxurious hotel but certainly perfectly fine for me to attend conference across the street. The double tree down the road much more beautiful, but also much for expensive... I would stay here again as long as i could find a decent breakfast nearby. Staff very pleasant.
1	Good experience, great location!. The Central Loop Hotel was in a super convenient location for walking to the Art Institute, restaurants, and shopping on State Street. I arrived by train, and it was just a couple of blocks walk to the hotel. The manager and front desk staff were very helpful and nice. The room was pretty basic, but clean and neat. Felt safe and secure. The only downside was the hotel practice of placing a deposit on my credit card for any incidental charges. I really don't like that practice. I noticed that I was not the only one, another hotel guest was complaining about it at the front counter while I was there. My hotel charges were paid in advance as a birthday gift from a family member, so I thought I was all taken care of, and then found out that I had to give them my credit card just in case there were any charges in addition. Of course there weren't any additional charges when I checked out. I just don't like having to do something like this.
0	Not a 3 star!. Beware when you book online! They show you pictures of main building and facilities. I booked the room fully aware that it is not a oceanfront room and booked a 'west side' and 'room with a view'. It never mentioned anywhere in the description that west side means across the street in a inn like property, completely separate from main building. Room was not good either, with a tiny bath, more like 2 star. And as for 'room with a view', I got a 'nice' view of steps and parking garage 5 feet away from door. Talking to hotel staff was not helpful either as they offered to 'upgrade' me to oceanfront room for an additional 50/ night. The hotel should not be allowed to advertise those rooms as 3 star and put clearly in description what the west side means. Never again!
0	Only okay. We found this hotel online with a discount coupon. Checked out the website and everything looked great...it boasts free shuttle service to Disneyland and Knotts and that it is a mile and a half away from Disneyland. Try about 5 miles. Took forever to find it. It was in this wierd, old part of town, off the beaten path, right on the main drag of Brookhurst street. Outside appearance was a little icky. It had an unattractive closed down restaurant as part of the hotel and an old shuttle that was sitting in the front. To our dismay, there were no longer any shuttle services offered. The rooms were old and a little bit dingy. You can hear people in the other rooms taking showers. The beds were not at all comfortable. TV got only a few stations. Definately not what we expected. We thought it was going to be a classy hotel by Disneyland. We felt slightly misled by the website. The perks The rooms had a microwave and little refridgerator. The pool was nice and secluded, very quiet and clean. My nephew and I swam for 2 hours, all alone! We were the only ones out there, it was great! Friendly staff, willing to help. Overall, this wasn't a horrible place to stay, but I will be much more diligent in the future when I do research for hotels.
0	Very Disappointed. The website is nothing like the actual hotel. Air Conditioning is broken, no business center, things in room are broken, NO PHONE is room. Its 11:45pm and they are now wanting to move me to another room. I'm not packing my things after driving 8 hours and moving to another room. NASTY hotel. Beware! Very disappointing. I will never stay... More
1	Great experience!. I was VERY nervous about choosing this hotel because of the negative reviews. But we were pleasantly surprised! A group of friends and I (girls, early 20s) stayed here on Saturday 12/28 and our total room cost was 115. We chose Rodeway because it was only a mile away from Bader Field where Life in Color was. The rooms were very clean! Outdated, but clean. Beds were actually pretty comfortable! Didn't use the TV. The bathrooms were also very clean. The shower's water pressure wasn't the best, but we dealt with it. Check in and check out went very quickly and smoothly. Not the friendliest people, but they got the job done. We found a place to park right outside of our room which was great. Parking is 10 which is annoying but you have to pay to park ANYWHERE in Atlantic City so I didn't mind. Anything beats paying 700 a night at Revel (that was their rate on the same night!!!). We were barely in our room all night, so this hotel is perfect for a group of friends who are just looking for a place to shower, pregame, and sleep. I wouldn't recommend this place to a couple only because it's not really romantic or anything. It's very basic, which is what we were looking for. There is a free breakfast but of course we didn't wake up early enough (ends at 10), however there was still fresh, hot coffee at 12pm when we checked out which was nice. This place is definitely NOT a 5-star hotel, but it's also not bad either. And no, we didn't see any hookers!
0	I may never stay at a Ritz Carlton Hotel again based on my experience in Atlanta. From attitude sales staff and management to quality of food and service this hotel has no right to put themselves in a 5 star category. As a conference planner I was shocked at the lack of interest they had in our business their arrogance...More
0	Noisy room !!. A lot of ventilation noise, it's impossible to sleep even the closed window ... In addition, it is necessary to know that it's the second year when we come and when we have the same chamber. It's unacceptable !! Look at the photo :Hello Axetoni11, please accept my sincerest apology if your stay with us was not acceptable. Please know that we appreciate your business and hoped that you booked with us directly so that we can give you a complimentary upgrade to one of our urban suite (based on availability). The front desk staff are also available to help you find a better room (interior/quiet) if the one we gave you was not up to your standard. Again, I apologize and hope that you'll give us another chance in the near future. Thank you for your feedback.
0	I was in shock and completely disappointed.. We came here on our wedding night we figured we would save money on the hotel so we would have more for fun in the city. We didn't expect AMAZING but we did expect comfortable. When we walked in the building the man working the desk was to busy watching the game to really greet us. He checked us in... More
1	Beautiful quiet and realxing place!. La Estancia in La Jolla, CA is a beautiful place with excellent services and staff. The food in the restaurants is delicious and there is attention to detail in all aspects of the resort. If you want a place to relax and renew yourself, this is it! Downtown La Jolla is about 5 miles away (about 20.00 taxi) and is worthwhile visiting for a day. Within walking distance of La Estancia is the Gliderport with stunning views of the Pacific Ocean and of gliders enjoying the warm winds!Dear Adriana C,Thank you for choosing to stay at Estancia while in La Jolla on business. We are so happy that you enjoyed our beautiful resort, appreciating the delicious cuisine, world-class services, and exemplary hospitality. We truly appreciate the excellent rating you have awarded us and hope to welcome you back to Estancia soon for another relaxing and refreshing stay.
1	Relaxing stay. Drury Inn and Suites in New Orleans was a wonderful choice for our extended stay after a conference. The location is very convenient to all of the sights. The streetcar stop is right on the corner. Our room was huge, clean and comfortable. We did not have a great view from our window but most of the time we were out and about. The price of the hotel was just right. The breakfast was free and plentiful. The best part about Drury Inn was the Kickback hours--free hot food and drinks! Every staff member we encountered was friendly and went out of their way to accommodate their guests. The staff at the front desk were extremely helpful. We will definitely stay at the Drury Inn and Suites the next time we visit New Orleans.
1	wonderful hotel centrally located. I stayed at the Kimpton during a business trip and loved the location. It is in the heart of the theater district and very close to public transit. The rooms were small but very clean and the bed was comfortable. I loved that they had a yoga mat in the room! Front desk was helpful and friendly. I would recommend the Kimpton HotelHey Monika!Thank for taking time to enhance our online reputation! Glad to see you were able to take advantage of our fabulous location and you were able to take advantage of some of our unique amenities! Come back and see us again soon!Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager
1	VERY NICE HOTEL CLOSE TO ALL AREA INTERESTS. Your staff is extremely friendly, sincere and professional. A sense of caring, and security was clearly evident - with a driver to ensure a positive experience was provided. Room was nicely furnished with all the amenities. Breakfast and manager's special was the right touch with the right level of support too. Entire hotel is very warm to include common areas as well. Exercise room has everything to get in a workout and the pool and hot tub is a great treat too. The papers, especially the WSJ is a great complimentary item. Loved all of it and will certainly be back. Being from Hawaii, this stay was very nice and very warm !! Travel to Maryland often and first time staying here, but not the last.
1	Nice and hip property. Clean, comfortable bed and modern dcor. A very nice rooftop bar but there are times this place gets too busy for the number of employees, so services gets a 7 (from 1-10) Good value on alcohol.The breakfast service is super good, the have a buffet style and fresh omelette's made to order. Must say this hotel does not really cater to the business traveler, no comfortable desk area in room, no place to make a few copies (i.e. business center) For a vacationer this is super great place, clean, location and good staff.Thank you for taking the time to share this review of your stay and for providing this feedback. Please know that this will be shared among our team leaders as we work to improve in all areas so that all guests have what they need to thoroughly enjoy their stay. It's great to hear how much you enjoyed our breakfast service, location, and most aspects of our property. We appreciate having you as our guest and look forward to having you stay with us again should your travels bring you back to the area.Regards,
1	A Haven. I stayed at Aloft while attending a convention. It fulfilled all I sought. A modern and well run newer hotel away from the citys congestion well suited for a business traveler. It is a 15 minute walk to the convention center or you can take a shuttle one block away. Easy walk to the French Quarter. The rooms are sufficient and contemporary. Housekeeping was spot on and ranks high for cleanliness. The rooms start on the 11th floor so you are well above street traffic. I would suggest as others have to request a corner room with windows to avoid the cruise ship interior cabin feeling if you need it. Nice bar with specials and the rooftop pool is relaxing. Special mention needs to be extended to the hotels outstanding front desk staff specifically, Lindsey and Mark (who also worked the bar). Friendly, savvy, hardworking, and patient- they belong in hotel hospitality and deserve recognition. Their inherent superior communication skills exceed standard service training programs. I happily recommend this lodging while in NOLA!Our staff will be elated to hear of your stay with us. From housekeeping to the front desk and even the bar, it sounds like you enjoyed all aspects of the hotel. We hope to be your hotel of choice when in the Big Easy.Cheers,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations
1	Love this Hotel. I have stayed at his hotel many times since 2005 it just gets better better. Check in is super easy, valet parking is great, and now the new evening meal is a wonderful addition to their already great breakfast. We stayed in room 830, in the new addition on 7-23 with my niece her 4 young children. This was a king suite with a roll away bed, we had a great nights sleep. This room has a view of the pool. We all enjoyed the pool and we enjoyed the evening meal the breakfast before going to the Aquarium the next day.
0	Bed Bug Inn. When I first pulled in the parking lot I seen furniture sitting outside of every room on the first floor, when I asked the front desk clerk about it he said they were remodeling. We found hair in the sheets so we asked the clerk for new sheets and he couldn't locate any. The next morning we went to front desk and the clerk told us tocall corporate. Later that night is when we discovered that we were actually being bitten by bed bugs not only were we bit we saw them with our own eyes I lifted the pillow from under my husband and seen one tiny bug,then I started to examine my daughters bed and I spotted a huge one.
1	Amazing Staff and Food. I need to first call out Mr. Fred, who helped us set up Rosalind's crib at 11 pm at night. All of the staff were very courteous and friendly, and made us feel at home. Later in the week, my chemistry fraternity had our banquet there. The food was some of the best I have ever had at a banquet. I highly recommend this hotel, for all business needs.Thank you for this wonderful review. Its a WOW! We are so delighted that we made your stay a memorable one. Thank you for the wonderful comments about our hotel we will share those with our entire team. We look forward to hosting you again should your travel plans bring you back the Midtown, Atlanta area.
1	Nice Hotel In A Good Location. Hotel was clean, well maintained, and mostly quiet even though there was a large group attending a weekend event (Battle of Atlanta). Our King Bed room was spacious and the bed was among the most comfortable I've ever experienced in a hotel. The hotel was within walking distance to Suntrust Park utilizing a new pedestrian bridge that crossed over the Interstate. It was well lit and I felt very safe because there were many people that used this bridge after the Braves game was over. The hotel is also convenient to Cumberland Mall across the street, also accessible by another pedestrian bridge. Numerous restaurants and shopping opportunities.Overall a very good stay at this hotel.Dear 805ronaldw,Thank you for your kind comments about the guest room cleanliness and for being spacious. Our housekeeping team strives to provide an outstanding experience for all of our guests.The proximity to the Battery / SunTrust Park is a wonderful aspect to the Renaissance. I am thrilled to hear you were able to discover something wonderfully new across the bridge.I look forward to seeing you next year.George
0	Dirty and not nice.. The room was not well maintained. The bathroom floor looked like it hadn't been swept or cleaned in a while. The room looked like it never had a real deep cleaning. The Towels in the bathroom where a grungy gray. It is not a well kept property. The breakfast pantry had a foul odor coming from it. I realize that... More
0	Not So Accommodating Accommodations. I WANTED to love The King Charles Inn because I LOVE Charleston so much. We visit often. We usually stay at the Doubletree Marketplace because we are being cheap, or for a splurge, at Charleston Place, in my opinion, the best place if you don't mind spending money. It's pointless to spend a lot, cause who lingers in their room... More
1	Looking Forward To Staying Here Again!. I booked this hotel for a weekend birthday trip. Upon arrival, my friend and I were greeted at the door. The front desk staff were very nice and personable. I was able to have an early check in as well. Our hotel room was lovely. Very Clean, Comfortable and Modern. I was surprised that the staff remembered it was my birthday, they surprised me with a birthday card that included all of the staffs signatures and chocolate covered strawberries.Overall my stay at The Renaissance was wonderful. Free Parking, Clean, Close to the highways and mall. Excellent staff and great rooms. The only thing I disliked was that guest had to pay for Wifi.Happy Birthday! Thank you for spending it with us, I am really glad you enjoyed my hotel and hope we have the opportunity t have you back soon!
0	Terrible. Worst motel I've ever went to. Spiders and other bugs in bed. My room smelled like throw up. Their was a knife under the bed but thank god it was just a toy. Beds have stains. Bugs in the shower. Right when I got to get in the shower right when I turned the water on.....brown water came out. You... More
1	DC. The hotel was undergoing renovations and we did have a problem with the water leaking from the second floor on us as we were on the first floor. The kids loved the pool and the breakfast was very nice. They let you in the breakfast area all day which is very nice for late night snacks for the kids and drinks for the adults. The shuttle to the metro station to catch the subway into DC was very nice and they pick you up as well. I know some folks complain that the last pick up is at 9 pm, but since the DC mall exhibits close at 6 pm it was not a problem. Due to the price of the metro I would recommend the travel time to start on or after 9:30 am
0	Stay here if you don't mind crappy service. I recently stayed at the Club Quarters while in Chicago for a family gathering. This hotel was a major disappointment for several reasons:1) They don't honor their commitments. I had reserved a room with a queen size bed through Expedia, but was given a room with two twin beds instead. The excuse: they ran out of bedspreads for queen size beds (how lame is that). 2) The elevator was unreliable. After checking in, myself and another guest were stuck on the first floor because of a malfunctioning card-reader in the elevator. The front desk staffperson fortunately was able to jiggle her card in a way that prompted the elevator to start moving. Not a good sign.3) The room reminded me of a depressing college dorm room. 4) The staff have no concept of customer service. On a prior visit, the staff were not willing to make any accomodations for a late checkout (even 15 minutes after the official checkout time - truly Kafkaesque). At checkout, no one has ever asked me whether I enjoyed my stay. Overall, the location is great, the rooms are clean and quiet, and all of the appliances work. But expect to be treated like a third-class citizen if you stay here.
0	one of the worst hotels we had stayed in during our time in america. we arrived at 11 am with confirmation from our booking agent that clearly states an early check in at 9.30am. there was no room for us, but the receptionist did say she would get a cleaner on to a room straight away. we looked around for a seat, there was a sofa that had stains all over it, we choose a table with cereals and other crumbs on it, it was the best table available in there. after an hour of waiting the receptionist lunch was delivered by a local takeaway, which she ate and had a soda to wash it down after 2 hours of waiting and no refreshments offered we were told our room was ready. it was a room that I had seen the cleaner clean when we first arrived, she had cleaned two more since that room but we were kept waiting. it was a strange room, your bathroom had a shower and toilet the sink was in the kitchen area which double up as a kitchen sink. the next day we went to checkout and the same receptionist was working, I went to hand in my key but was kept waiting while she was putting polish on her finger nails, while we waited for her, we spoke to another couple who were sat on the same table we sat the day before, they also had confirmation for an early check in but no room was ready. finally all the receptionist nails were done and she took our key . there was no goodbye, thank you, how was your stay.....nothing. we would not recommend this hotel to anyone. we have even told our travel agent how bad it was and they have said that they just went by the Ramada name brand.....well we wont be staying at that hotel next time we visit san diegoComments from our guests are extremely appreciated as they allow us to better understand how we can improve our accommodations. We are very sorry to hear you experienced anything other than friendly and courteous service during your stay. Your report of the level of service you received upon arrival and departure, is alarming as our team is usually known for their professional and helpful attitudes. This issue will be addressed immediately. Your feedback will be used as a training opportunity. It is our hope that you will consider staying with us again so we can deliver the experience you were expecting. Thank you for sharing your feedback with us.
1	A convenient and worthwhile place to stay. The hotel is located 10 minutes from the airport and is within minutes of many chain food eateries and other convenient stores. The hotel is clean, the rooms are spacious and the soundproofing allows for a good night of sleep. Breakfast is included and is the basic buffet fare found at these type of hotels. The hotel also has a bar and a kitchen that can provide room service and bar food upon request. WiFi is included and we found it satisfactory.One caveat: there are a couple of gas stations in the immediate proximity of the hotel that charge outrageous prices for gas. on the day of our visit they were charging 4.59/gal when the going rate was 2.23. If getting gas go down the road a little bit to avoid these rip offs.
0	Rebecca K. Wow I should have listened to the other reviews. We just needed a place to stay for one night and we thought we would give this place a chance after hearing it was recently remodeled. The smell when you walked in the halls was horrible and dirty smelling. It became even worse when we entered our room. The bathroom smelled... More
1	Super Location, Professional Staff, Fun Atmosphere. Having recently spent 45 days at this Hotel, and having been there for an extended stay prior to this trip, I feel uniquely qualified to write this review. First, I found the Staff to be extremely friendly, helpful and professional, always quick to respond to my requests and needs. Being a single, older woman, I was delighted to feel safe and secure during my stay. The room was clean and the appearance pleasing, the bed was very comfortable, and breakfast in the mornings was always good. In the late afternoon, it was fun having 'Happy Hour' with great prices on wine and a light food selection. I appreciated that there are washers and dryers located on each floor. The Hotel is near all of San Diego's most sought after sites, shopping, Old Town and it's a breeze to jump on freeways to go anyplace. I will most certainly be staying at the Four Points again.Hello,Thank you first of all for staying with us. The staff really enjoyed having you here and they were sad to see you go. I am so happy to hear you were so well cared for. I will definitely pass on the nice compliments to the staff.Thank you once again.LBGeneral Manager
1	Must stay!. Great location ten min walk to bourbon/French quarter! The place is modern and funny and very clean. The staff is super friendly l. Stacy was very helpful and loved her energy. She helped us book a last min trip for the city/cemetery tour. You can tell she really likes what she does. Love the southern accent! I would def recommend this place!! YAY Stacy!! I will be sure to share your kudos with her as well as our entire staff. Thanks for choosing ALOFT NOLA for your stay, we hope to see you again on your next visit.Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations
0	Over Priced. Not a 3 star more like 2 star. Small room no fridge or micro. Old style room.
1	Amazing venue. I'll start with saying this review is of The Pearl as venue, not just a hotel. I am very familiar with the property, as I live nearby, and stop in for a drink or dinner frequently. Point Loma is an often undiscovered part of San Diego, especially by tourists. Those in the know understand that some of our cities best gems are located on the peninsula, one of which is The Pearl. I recently hosted my company's holiday party here, and it was fantastic. It all starts with the venue, The Pearl surprises people because from the street most people have no idea what lies inside. Inside you'll find a lovingly restored motor lodge that brings back the spirit of 60's mid-century modern with some modern polish. That is complemented by a great bar and restaurant where you can find great cocktails, and unique food served by staff who are truly invested in what they do.I'll be the first to say that I prefer hotels, restaurants, and bars that have a point of view, and that are sometimes a bit quirky. If that's what you are looking for check out The Pearl.Thanks for acknowledging the Pearl for the great venue that it is, plus Point Loma!!!. is a great community. sometimes tourist overlook it, but it has lots and lots to offer. Hope you will come again soon. Tell a Friend.
0	Ok place to stay. I stayed here for one night. I was not able to check in right at 3 pm so I had to leave and come back. The young lady at the front desk was pleasant enough. The room was decent, although the bath towels smelled like cigarette smoke. I did see the cleaning staff outside the rooms with their carts smoking cigarettes. At times some of the guest were a bit loud and you could here them, but it didn't bother me enough to complain. The location was good for where I needed to go. Ok place to stay for a night OR 2 but I wouldnt do more than that.
0	weirdest hotel stay experience. We travel fairly often and stayed in a lot of hotels. This is the most strange experience we have ever had (in a bad way). We pre-paid three nights' stay. After the first night, we went out to tour the city. When we came back in the evening, we realized all the stuff we left in the closet, the dresser... More
0	I would rather sleep in my car!. The room was big and bed comfortable. Everything else was bad. Dirty, no hot water. Poor TV reception. Spotty wifi. Moldy hallway. Dangerous neighborhood. Bkfst only for tour groups. Faucets poor condition. Couch stained and baggy. Rug stained. Hole in door screen. Road under construction. Etc. etc.
1	Great location, staff, and decor. A really comfortable place to base your weekend in SF. A bit artsy and oozes character - subtly. The rooms at the back are really quiet day or night. But you're still two short blocks from Union Square. Reasonably small hotel the staff are courteous and helpful. We had dinner Friday night in the hotel bar - The Library. There was live jazz on Friday night and we discovered that about 2/3 the people in the bar were locals - who are quite friendly. Even the singer came and said hi to us after she'd finished.Powell St streetcar is half a block from the hotel, though we walked to the Pier 1 area in about 15 minutes (great farmers' market on Saturday morning). The hotel is about 5 minutes' walk from the Powell St BART station. For a cheapskate like me, that's a great airport connection. Plus, taking BART rather than a taxi saves 10lb of carbon emissions per journey. Plus it saves 20, plus it saves 30 minutes during rush hour, ...Food options abound. Lots of Thai restaurants around the corner
0	First of all they say they don't rent rooms to florida.... First of all they say they don't rent rooms to florida residents unless you put up a deposit but they don't tell you this until you get there when it is to late to cancel or make another res somewhere else. My weekend there the temp dropped down into the 40s and the room furnace did not work so cold... More
1	Nice Place To Lay Your Head for the pricr. So if you are going to Chicago to stay in your luxury hotel to be pampered with massages and 5 star room service- this is not your hotel. If you are going to Chicago to shop, sight see, or hit a few wonderful restaurants and want a clean, well maintained hotel where you can sleep peacefully- this is your place. The price is great for what you get. There are few frills, but the accommodations are very reasonable in terms of function and comfort. The perks:- Great location! Close to shopping, parks, restaurants, Navy Pier and most downtown sights.- In and out valet parking for a reasonable Chicago price (52/day). You can find cheaper parking nearby, but not with in and out options.- Complimentary ater bottles and purified water on all floors.-Lounge with complimentary snacks, coffee, tea, and soda open for much of the day.- Wine in the Lobby in the evening.- Responsive, kind staff.-Free high speed internet is high speed enough for most purposes.The less fabulous aspects:-Rooms are small or sparsely decorated. The rooms serve as a clean, functional space. There are no bathtubs, only showers. You get a a couch, TV, mini fridge and desk if you upgrade to a queen suite.-Matrresses are firm...not so firm those of us who prefer softer beds can not sleep, but firm.- Valet was understaffed for our visit with only one attendant even during busier times. It did take 20 minutes to get our car when requested.- The cable is not top quality and goes out or the stream gets paused often.
0	Barely adequate. Very low rent establishment. Old and run down...but what do you want for 55 dollars We arrived, slept, and departed. I did not see any bugs. Old funky bathroom. A cast if characters from a Fellini movie ..
1	quite nice really...shame about the constant noise. How lovely to finally find our hotel and discover the sign reads the NARCH HOTEL!, thankfully it didnt live up to its accidently given name! The reception staff were polite, if a little unapproachable, we had to discover all the facilities of the hotel by roaming around....only after 5 daysof braving the homeless people to use the phone in the street, did we discover the payphone and vending machines. They could really use a map of the hotel, or at least show you the facillities on arrival. Our room was comfy and clean, the bed was a brilliant size and so nice to crawl into after scaling the hills all day!! The maid service was excellent. The down sides were apparent straight away, our room was facing the corner of a busy junction, on the 6th floor....the constant traffic woke us up frequently as did the fire trucks which used their sirens freely and at least twice in the night, every night!!!!! The area is dodgy looking but actually not as bad as we anticipated, true there are homeless people everywhere and the street cleaners dont seem to venture that far, but we never had any trouble ( in fact i encountered more scary situations in the lift with non english speaking leery men who find it 'funny' to wedge you into a corner...) most homeless people were friendly or kept to themselves. Take a right as you come out the hotel, and you'll find a fantastic sandwhich shop QUIZNOS, right again and a cinema,diner and cocktail bar which are all really nice yet not mentioned in our guide. Lovely trip overall!!!
1	Very pleased!. - Excellent location- Comfortable, supportive, king sized bed- storage space for luggage- free access to in-room safe- reasonable bathroom amenities - good sized writing desk for planning your day- helpful staff (didn't call on their help much though)- slightly noisy with ventilation ducting and noise from the corridors but acceptable still- refurbishment work not a problem (carpet laying still when we arrived)- near Union Square so some noise associated with proximity. Not too bad. Not a large room that we stayed in but we merely slept here. It puzzles me as to why people expect a tennis court sized room....are they coming to sleep and visit the city or stay inside the whole tripWe would recommend this hotel.
1	SERVICE and ATMOSPHERE. There were some areas great and some were not. We still enjoy the most of them. The location of the hotel was great and very easy access to all amenities. Our best overall service that we were enjoying most was the shuttle drivers. They were very helpful and care a lot to all areas of the service. We all recommended them the best. The second area we enjoyed as well was the dinning in area especially outside. The coffee was great we love it the most too. The service there was great too. Our rooms were good just not much space to move from one end to another but other than that it was okay. The only two areas that we weren't enjoying at all was at the reception area just one receptionist that was very helpful, her attitude was too good at all, she never smile and not helpful too. The other area that we weren't enjoyed was around the all rooms the smoking cannabis it was horrible and very bad, outside where we were staying when open the door we couldn't breath because of the horrible smell as well as people have no respect to other people around.
0	Good cheap nights stay. The Hotel seems to have some really nice staff. The people staying in the hotel are a mix of sketchy to good people. The rooms need maintenance and repainted. the TV quality was poor. There was only one ice machine. There is no Breakfast. Pool area was okay. The picture in our room looked like it was on its last leg. Did not see any bugs. Bed was Comfortable.
1	Well-run boutique hotel in downtown Seattle. We spent one night at the Sorrento to attend a friend's event. Our room was not ready when we arrived at 3pm, but they got it together reasonably quickly and were suitably apologetic. Otherwise the service was attentive and personal. The hotel has old world charm and would make a good choice for a romantic weekend or quick business stopover. We didn't try the restaurant, but the food served at our event was excellent.Thank you for taking the time to write about your stay with us. I'm happy to read that our staff responded appropriately to the delayed check-in. I'm pleased to work with such a professional staff. I'm sorry to hear that you weren't able to dine in our restaurant during your stay. However, the excellent event meal you described was exactly what we aim in our Catering department. Our Executive Chef worked to create a catering menu that has functionality for large groups, but retains the quality you expect in a restaurant setting. So, in a way you were able to try some of our restaurant highlights! We hope you have a return stay planned, and that you'll be able to try out the actual restaurant. We'll be sure to have your table waiting. Cheers!Angie M. MykelGeneral ManagerWe hope to welcome you back soon and hopefully yo
1	Walk to Fisherman's Wharf. As others have said, this is a great little place within a few blocks of the Fisherman's Wharf area. It is clean and well kept, and the staff were very good. Noah at the front desk was very informative and up on the weather around the bay area as well. We stayed here two different nights in one week, before and after our travels into wine country, and were very satisfied. We chose The Columbus Motor Inn rather than some possibly bigger named places because of the price, but more for the assurance that we would have a parking space at our hotel and not have to search the downtown streets for parking, or pay some outrageous fee to park after we already were paying the hotel. What a great decision as parking was a real PITA in the city, everywhere. If you could find parking on the streets, most of it was metered, and some questionable. If you were lucky to find a safe looking garage, it was expensive. On the wharf they wanted 7 per hour, so we just walked from the hotel! Factor that into your decision. The rooms were comfortable and the flat-screen TV was nice as well. I'll make this one of my favorite places for certain! I'll post a picture taken from our room looking down Columbus toward the pyramid and the Coit Tower.
1	Friendly Staff and Convenient Location. I used this hotel for an event we were having and Heather Gordon was amazing! She helped me coordinate 30 rooms and make sure that everybody had what they needed. The location was perfect since it was close enough to Gaslamp and Petco Park. Everyone enjoyed their stay and I enjoyed how easy it was to coordinate accommodations for 30 people. Thank you Heather and Sheraton!Hello,Thank you for the nice compliments, especialy about Heather. We think she's great as well. We appreciate you choosing the Four Points Sea World and for taking the time to write a review for us.Thank you once again.LBGeneral Manager

OMG the place is HORRIBLE. this place is one of those hotels they show in horror movies where they kill people. I kid you not! this place is horrible. i only stayed... More
0	Not what you'd expect. The hotel is very close to the freeway - in fact we looked down on the off ramp. Looks like they are still updating - but the bathroom really needs help
0	Do Not Stay Here!. The place is a dump. Room was filthy and looks like it wasn't cleaned. I stood at the front desk for 5 minutes before she even acknowledged me. The room was musty and was almost afraid to lie down on the sheets because of bedbugs. Stay anywhere else but here. This place should be condemned.
0	Worst hotel I have stayed. Terribly managed hotel. Probably the worst hotel I have stayed in a while. Arrived late in the evening and found a que of guests trying to check in. One family with four kids apparently had booked two rooms via Expedia only to be told they had only one room with a king bed available. The two guys behind the counter had no clue what to do - listening to their phone conversation with (apparently) their manager, it seems they had a number of free rooms - but those had not been cleaned and where dirty. They also made everyone pay a 200 security fee - which upset several of the guests trying to check in. My room was prepaid and I did not have that problem. However, I needed to go three times up to my room on the 6th floor because the key card did not work - they then switched me to another room. The door of the first room had clear signs of an attempted break in. Since they could give me another room, why did they not give another one for this family Room was ok but smelled moldy. Breakfast was poor and breakfast room pretty dirty and unpleasant. To sum it up, I do not recommend this hotel. Should have chosen the Courtyard Marriott across the street instead - eventhoug it is a little more expensive. Other folks in my group stayed there - I should have done the same.
0	Not so great. This hotel has tiny rooms and gross bathrooms. 5 days after staying there and I am sick as a dog. I cant help but feel I may have gotten diva'd. Do not stay here unless you are desperate. I have stayed in over 20 hotels in SF and this is by far the worst. Very close to a hooker hotel.Thank you for the feedback on your stay. We apologize your visit was less than excellent. We wish your stay would have been more enjoyable. Thanks again.
1	Perfect Location. Right next to the shopping my wife loves on Union Sq. and the older more staid hotels of SF like the St. Francis is the Diva. I went to SF for a business conference the St. Francis but decided I wanted to get away from the business crowd somewhat. Diva was a perfect choice. It was a block from the conference but a whole different atmosphere. From the famous guests prints in the concrete to the lights in the elevator and the curtains on the wall the Diva was fun. Staff was friendly and focused and the bed was comfortable. I'll definately do it again.Dear Ian J,Thank you for staying at Hotel Diva. I'm glad you had a pleasant stay with us, I hope you will think of us again on your next visit to San Francisco.Best regards,Virgil LopezHotel Manager

0	Cockroach with no assistance. We stayed July 11, 2005. Room 627. Room was in terrible shape: cigarette burns in the carpet, upholstered chair looked so worn it was dirty. We shut the window curtain only to be faced with a large cockroach. Sixth floor, no less. Called front desk: We're completely booked tonight or I would move you to another room. Maintenance is gone for the day, so I'll try to get up in 10 minutes. 45 minutes later I went downstairs. Two people were at the desk checking in another party. I voiced my complaint and was told they were busy with a customer. I replied that I thought I was a customer too, only to be told: Have a nice night. Last time for us at a Drury.
0	Bed Bugs!. I stayed in a room on the 3rd floor. Upon waking up, I found a bed bug on the curtain. After calling the front desk, I was told that finding a bed bug was absolutely impossible. Donna, at the front desk, said she'd be right up. After waiting 10 minutes, I called back down to see when she anticipated coming... More
0	Just disgusting. That was one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed. Well, actually the second Super 8 in a row that was so awful. Everything was so dirty that we didn't even take our clothes off when we went to bed. The towels had stains all over, the bathroom floor was covered in black hair, the bathtub had soap scum... More

Of the four couples who stayed here (in our group) only 1 couple did NOT have extra charges placed on his/her credit card. Each of the extra charges were traced back to this hotel - - - for NON-hotel expenses. Luckily my credit card company knows... More
0	Worst hotel I have ever stayed in. Dreadful place to stay. Beyond belief that they can charge such an exorbitant rate for such inferior accommodation. We arrived late after an exhausting journey and just needed some sleep. Some hope. Dirty room, did not want to walk round without shoes on. Could not bring ourselves to sit on the sofa. Curtains were hanging off the tracks so barely... More
1	Unbeatable for location price. We will be staying here again on our next trip. We have been to San Francisco on many occassions and this is the first time we have found a decent hotel with free parking at a reasonable rate anywhere remotely nearly this location.The good - One block to the cable cars, a couple of blocks to Fishermans' Wharf, Muni at your door step, cycling shop next door, great indian food over the road and other amenities a stones throw. Place was clean, staff were always willing and helpful. The bad - (1) no air con in the room, which might be a problem on a hot night and (2) no fridge. Oh, the neighbouring property is called Bimbos which is what you might think, but even though our room overlooked it, there was no noise and nothing at street level that caused us concern.This place is a credit to the owners their staff.

We would like to apologize for the service you received at the front desk, as our company believes that each of our guests should experience exceptional service when they stay at one of our hotels. The front desk may not have had a situation that played out as yours did before, but we have spoken with the department on how to handle these things better. We are an older property, and like all houses and buildings, there is occasionally the visit from bugs. We undertake a comprehensive pest control program which includes regular visits from a specialist pest control organization for preventative maintenance. It is important to advise our guests that silverfish are indeed not related to bed bugs. We take bed bugs very seriously, as they are an infestation that can travel and affect guest comfort, however we take all bug visitors seriously since your feedback we have notified housekeeping and our pest control department to monitor the area. Regarding your further comment about reheating your food, unfortunately the San Diego County Health Department will not allow food into our kitchen that does not come from a permitted Food Distributor. We are sorry this was an inconvenience for you. Thank you for staying with us and sharing your comments with us.Kind Regards Safe Travels,Best Western Seven Seas Management Staff

1	Weekend getaway. Cool hotel, great vibe. Lobby has been redone and is spacious. Rooms have a modern ship buildout which is fun. Only complaint is the multi use toiletries mounted to the wall of the shower. Even though there is a metal bar preventing tampering, its still the only place I've seen non single use toiletries! Other than that this place is great. The yard is very fun and has indoor shuffleboard and outdoor games galore with interesting areas to hangout. Don't miss the upscale food trucks within walking distance on Beach street. We enjoyed Carmel Pizza and the Codmother.Greetings David3135,Super excited that you chose to stay with us at Hotel Zephyr for your weekend getaway. We couldnt be more proud of our yard and thrilled that you found it very fun. Please be sure to stay with us again on your next get away. May all your travel experiences be unique,Jason WilliamsGeneral Manager
1	Excellent stay marred by some service issues, but hotel has good. We had our second stay at the St Regis San Francisco for our annual December SF dining weekend--our first was in 2014, though I've had a few business stays in the meantime. Overall, we still love this hotel--but we did experience a few hiccups with service that gave us pause. The hotel has already provided us with a complimentary stay for 2016 to make up for the problems this year, so we feel the hotel got the message and definitely has taken steps to make it up to us.We were informed of our upgrade from the Astor to Metropolitan Suite in an email from my Ambassador the night before arrival. Yet on arrival, they didn't have us in the Metropolitan Suite. After 25 min and showing the email confirmation, we finally were given the keys to the correct suite. This was a big hiccup, but since we got the upgrade I was willing to let it go.The suite and design of the hotel and and everything about it is still near-perfect for me. I love the design of the property, and the layout of the suites/rooms. I love its location in SoMa. I love the food/beverage, from the restaurant, room service and the lobby bar. Everyone is very friendly.We did have several housekeeping mistakes, and the management response to those was less than satisfactory. Even after our complaints, housekeeping still managed to screw up, something that I'd not experienced on any previous stay at this hotel. The fact that this was the weekend immediately prior to the Christmas holiday made me wonder if the property might be a bit understaffed or under-managed. We also had issues with wifi, both in the room (which was fixed in a few hours) and in the restaurant (which was fixed in about 20 min). We finally had issues with trying to reach our butler(s) on several occasions. We would call and it would ring and ring and ring with no answer on numerous tries. That was also another first for us at this hotel. We often had to call another department to be connected to the butler or front desk, and even then it took more time than it should have. That again made us wonder if the hotel was understaffed due to the imminent holiday period.Otherwise, again, we still love this hotel. Considering that we've had nothing but near-flawless visits here, we were and are most willing to give the hotel the benefit of the doubt. The fact that the hotel management awarded us a free 3 night stay for next December 2016 to remedy the mistakes of this visit more than made up for us for the lack of excellent service in the instances described above. We have faith that these were unusual slip-ups, and I still look forward to returning. I also have several business trips to SF planned in 2016, and I expect to be staying here for those, as well.Dear Bill R,Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts on your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco. I regret hear of the delays in service that you received during this visit, and sincerely appreciate your understanding and loyalty to our hotel. We look forward to welcoming you back on several occasions in 2016, but please do not hesitate to contact me directly at any time.Sincerely, Anthony Duggan Hotel Manager 415-284-4057 anthony.dugganstregis.com
0	Not dirty but you get what you pay for.. Pros: cheap, microwave, fridge, WiFi. Cons: cigarette smoke seeps in, towels are dingy, stuff is broken the welcome letter that talks about the rules and check out time advises patrons not to attempt to repair broken items, walls between units are exceptionally thin leaving nothing to the imagination, ID is not necessary to rent a room.
0	You get what you pay for. It served the purpose of being close to the airport. Other than that, not much good to say. Very dated, loud heater that made it hard to sleep, awful towels. Had the creeps all night. Housekeeping did as good as they could with old used-up rooms.
0	The staff is rude. The GM was rude I've never seen so much lack of professionalism in a etabliment in my life. We went to her to state concern and she immediately became defensive, loud, rude and condescending. Never againMa'am, I apologize that I would not allow you to smoke marijuana in your room, but in Louisiana, it is illegal. I can understand how you could perceive me as rude because I had to have New Orleans Police Department evict you from the hotel.
0	There's a saying.... You get what you pay for. I will leave it at that.

Kitchenette consisted of small microwave and fridge. No lamps, alarm clock or radio in room. Room wasn't particularly clean ( straws and small trash in corners, crumbs by night stand) Grounds not...

1	Good Place in a Good Area. This hotel is situated in an area not too far out of the city. Down the road, is the well known pier 39. A bike hire shop is also a minutes walk away, which was useful. Bus and tram links passed nearby, so if you don't feel like walking there is plenty of public transport for you to use.If you are arriving by car, free parking (2 levels) is available with a lift on each level to take you to your room.The staff were extremely friendly and were willing to talk.Free WiFi is available, but was a pain to connect and it kept dropping out constantly.In conclusion, probably one of the best hotels in the area for a very good price. It is situated in the middle of all of the attractions and is within walking distance of eateries and public transport.
1	Good hotel - No pool - charge to use the sauna.. The hotel was good, not great. I didn't feel pampered - but I was comfortable (I think it supposed to be a 4 star hotel). The nice thing is that its close to the shopping mall which has a grocery store on the lower level! The mall also has a great food court also you can easily stock your room. The hotel staff was very nice and accommodating. I would stay here again. However!!!! Get rid of the 7.00 charge to use the sauna, it's ridiculous moreover, they can't possibly be making any 'real' profit off of a 7.00 dollar charge.
0	I was not happy with my room at all. The bed was broken , there was no hot water nd when I Asked for another room they said no
0	Insects. I guess they don't care about the little critters that creep around the room. We informed the front desk and all they said was, hum. We usually have the rooms sprayed! Found two centipedes and spiders crawling around.
1	Go To Hotel in San Francisco. I'm a gold Starwood member and membership definitely has its perks. One place where you can definitely take advantage of great opportunities is the St. Regis in San Francisco. I've never had a less than stellar experience here. Stay in an Executive Premier guest room. Terrific value, space, design and comfort. Opt for the butler service -- always spot on and an amazing asset during your stay, from wake up service to the little touches, they anticipate your needs - the butler service is one of the hallmarks of the St. Regis experience. Gin and tonic Why yes, please.I stay at the St. Regis when I have friends in from out of town or when I just need a few days of aaaahhh time or when I'm returning from a long haul flight. I'm never disappointed. Ever. If you have the chance and the budget, do yourself a favor and stay at this truly world-class hotel.
1	Do Not Miss Staying Here!!!!. Our second time to stay here and I can never get enough of it!! Great staff, bend over backwards to help you, whether housekeepers or front desk staff. Genevieve was a delight helping me arrange for airport transportation that worked out great!! Rooms are always a joy, clean and well furnished with lovely ammenities in the bathroom (and I NEVER take the extra's home - except here)! Light on breakfast with no restaurant, but so many restaurants in the area it doesn't even matter. Last visit had Room 201, this visit had 208 and both exceeded my every expectation. Thank you again and long to be back already!!!!!Thank you for taking the time to leave us with such a wonderful five star review. I'm extremely elated to see that we're your hotel destination when you come to La Jolla and we have been consistently friendly and efficient. We truly appreciate your recommendations, and can't wait to serve you next time. Should you have any further comments, questions, or suggestions, please feel free to contact me personally. Thank you for being a part of our family here at the Pantai Inn and we look forward to seeing you again.After sharing this review with Genevieve, she was truly excited to have her advice acknowledged. The next time you plan on making a La Jolla visit, she has asked to call and ask for her personally or anyone of our staff so they can handle all your San Diego concierge needs.Warm wishes,Dan Priano
0	Worst Hotel I have ever book on Expedia!!!!!!!!!!!. Stay away from this place. It is a dirty roach Motel!! It seems like the place is more like low income housing for homeless people and drug users then a hotel for tourists-visitors. The rooms were dirty and smelled. There were people smoking weed and doing drugs in the parking lot. I would not recommend this place to anyone.
1	Really friendly and helpful owners, good location. The hotel were helpful assisting us with questions before our stay, and we're happy to let us leave our car and luggage for the full day before checking in so that we could enjoy the day at Disney. The managers / owners () were really friendly and gave great service. The room was clean,spacious and modern with more facilities (fridge, coffee maker and microwave) than some 4 star hotels we stayed in on our trip. It was a 15-20 min walk to Disney which was really convenient and there is a shuttle bus which stops outside. I would happily recommend this hotel to family and friends
0	Construction, fake free breakfast, zero service. The hotel was under major construction - there is no front desk/lobby area. This was not apparent when booking the room. The front door was closed and there were work crews in the makeshift lobby area during our entire stay. The free breakfast is a single piece of bread and a small glass of orange juice. There is no free breakfast. The hotel is extremely overpriced. The hotel is within decent walking distance of the New Orleans sights. The customer service is non-existent. I booked this hotel through hotels.com after calling to confirm that I could use a third party site and still get a Cruise and Stay discount on cruise terminal parking. The hotel CONFIRMED that I could do this. They also CONFIRMED this when I arrived at check-in. At check out they DENIED that I could have discounted cruise parking and the front desk employee refused to contact a manager or customer service for me. Customer service did not answer my call after 30 minutes.Dear E G,I am terribly sorry to read about the service that you experienced in May of 2016. We are no longer under any construction and I can assure you that this is not typical service for our hotel- especially now. I apologize that you were misinformed about our cruise parking rate as that does need to be booked directly in order to ensure the discount. I am not sure who you are referencing in regards to customer service but there is no excuse for the experience that you had. We do offer a complimentary croissant along with your choice of coffee, a variety of teas or orange juice delivered right to your room. It is our intention for this to be a nice treat before you head out to explore our beautiful city for the day. If you find yourself in New Orleans again, I do hope you stop by to see the difference a year can make. Best,Jennifer DragnaGeneral Manager(504)304-4000
0	Overpriced, teeny, tiny rooms. Fantastic location but for 200/night, I would have expected a larger room. My room was smaller than any hotel I've stayed at in NY, London or Hong Kong where rooms are notoriously small. There are many, many better options near the Mag Mile and in River North so look elsewhere.
1	Comfortable and Affordable. Overall I had a great stay at this hotel. I was traveling alone with three children four years old and younger and needed a place to overnight that was safe, affordable and comfortable. The room was a great size, the beds and pillows were very comfortable and the linens were good quality. We arrived after midnight and the hostess that greeted us was very friendly and helpful. The breakfast spread was nice and the pool area looked amazing though sadly we had no time to enjoy it. Only negative I had with this stay is that I requested a crib for the night and it was not set up when we got into the room. Unfortunately we checked in so late that although there was a crib available for the front desk to provide one, were no linens for it. Since I had a portable one in my car this wasn't a big deal for me (other than an extra trip out to the parking lot).
1	A first class experience.. Le St.-Rgis est incroyable. What a gorgeous hotel and what an upscale experience you will live by staying there. It was a dream come true. And if it wasn't enough, I bumped into Kate Mara in the elevator. I tried to act cool but totally failed. The rooms are perfect. The staff is perfect. Every square inch is clean and every detail was taken care of. I was lucky enough to have dinner in La Salle de Bal. It was fantastic. Thank you to the FPA for everythingDear PIERRE-YVES L, On behalf of The St. Regis New York, we thank you for both reviewing the property and allowing us to be a part of your New York City adventures! We do hope you will be back to stay with us soon and ask that you please let us know when you are returning! We would love to have you as our guest in the future!Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager
1	Unique, great location and value. I decided to give the San Remo 5 stars because what they do, they do very well. It is absolutely charming, the folks at the desk are very helpful and friendly, and the whole atmosphere is welcoming, homey, with some nice touches. Mini raisin boxes and mini soaps from Chinatown in the rooms lemon water, coffee and tea in the lobby books and guides for your perusal and a fantastic location are all nice features. On the downside, just so you know what you are getting into, the bathrooms and shower rooms don't have a sink so you are washing your hands in the corridor. Speaking of corridors, they are tiny and narrow, and if you have a thoughtless, noisy neighbor who talks loudly, you will not have peace. The rooms are very small. That said, I would absolutely stay here again next time I am in San Francisco. The area around Washington Square is charming, there are some terrific restaurants, including Mama's for breakfast, nearby, and you can walk to the Marina district or SOMA easily.
0	2 out of 5 stars. I have to disagree. I think the staff in the hotel lobby were not helpful or friendly at all. A young girl one of the days, didn't seem to care less to help me out with the bus schedule or any kind of help. But the shuttle boys, the bayside bar, and cafe servers in the hotel were AMAZING and helpful though!!!! Thank you to all those guys/gals!!! Ask for Steve if you need a shuttle to/from the airport!! :)Well first off we had a pretty long travel with a bunch of luggage. When we finally got to the hotel.. we got directions to our room (which was on the VERY last block of the hotel.. and 2nd floor) so anyways, we went off to find our room, well the directions we got sucked and we got a little lost, and finally we found it (keep in mind we were lugging around a baby, stroller, carseat, 3 huge luggages, backpack, diaper bag) Oh and not to forget that we had to make two trips up and down the stairs to get all our luggage in. We were sweating bullets when we finally settled in our hotel room. So after a 8 hour travel than getting to our room in tim buck two it was just a diaster!! Ruined my night for sure!! But the room was okay. The view out the balcony was better than what i thought!! A great view of the pool and the garden. And it was cool that we got to sit out on the deck. We had a room in the old building, so it was a little old unsafe feeling i had the entire stay. The beds were pretty comfortable and made nicely. The little fridge was in a cabinet under the TV, which had a little odor in it and sat on a stained shelf. I actually have never experience a Holiday inn as a motel before, but this room made me feel like i was in a motel. I would not stay here again... not unless it was for a cheaper price than what i paid. If i wanted a motel feel like room.. i would of stayed at Days Inn for half the price!Dear Kristen386, Thank you for your stay with us and leaving feedback. We are pleased you liked the location of our hotel as well as the view from your room. We take our guest comments very seriously and always strive to provide comfortable and friendly accommodations. Were sorry you received service and room conditions which fell below your expectations. I appreciate your feedback as this is our best resource for improving guest services. We hope you give us a chance in the future to show you how great our hotel is.If there is anything we can do to make your next stay more comfortable, please do not hesitate to ask the Manager on Duty.Sincerely,Jaime WCase ManagerIHGCare
1	Great Meeting Hotel. I have been staying at this Marriott Hotel almost yearly for the past 34 years and it has always evolved to keep up with the needs of it's clientele. Currently, it is a very good meeting site for large and small conferences or special events such as weddings. The rooms have been upgraded, not luxurious but functional with down comforters. The price is very reasonable for all of the amenities--indoor/outdoor pool, jacuzzi, exercise room, bar, restaurant, concierge, proximity to the rapid transit station, restaurants and to O'Hare Int'l airport. There is a courtesy shuttle that will pick up and drop off at the airport. Overall, unless I need to be in the city, this is my go to place for Chicago.
1	Couldn't have picked a better place! We will be back!. I would have to say it is pretty difficult picking out a place to stay from the internet. I found Ocean Park Inn from a San Diego travel website and could not have been happier with my find. I was nervous for what to expect, but was so thrilled when I arrived. Wonderful location with beautiful views!...perfect walking distance to stores, restaurants, and most importantly the beach! Also great location for driving to popular attractions. This hotel had an amazing beach front view. We first at the 1st floor ocean view room, did not like it due to it having a joined balcony with the other guests. Alexandra at the front desk did not hesitate and never asked questions about changing our room to the 2nd floor with the ocean view to have a private balcony. Both rooms were very clean as well as the whole hotel! All staff was very friendly and never hesitated to help in any way. Breakfast was very enjoyable with the area always kept clean. Pool and hot tub were great, especially with the palm tree and gorgeous sky view! Weekends around the hotel seem to attract a very large and lively college age group to the bars and surrounding area, however it all calms down the next day and week day nights. My husband and I felt very comfortable and safe there which was extremely important to us, that is why we recommend it to all the people we know and cannot wait to come back!!!...especially that the front desk staff was very accommodating when my husband surprised me by shipping our wedding cake topper to the hotel on dry ice to celebrate our 1 year wedding anniversary. It was a wonderful surprise and I thank them very much for allowing that which made our stay more memorable!
1	Started off bad, ended up great. I checked into the JW Buckhead Thursday Jan 27 for 3 nights. I was in a regular room and ended up getting an upgrade to a suite for 20 more. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. The suite was nice and spacious. The hotel overall was nice but could probably use a renovation sometime soon to keep up with all the other new hotels in the area. I went out to dinner and got back to my room at about 11pm. Shortly after I decided to take a shower then go to bed. Bad news! There was no hot water. I let the shower run for about 10 min, still no hot water. I called the front desk and they sent up an engineer. He confirms there is no hot water becuase the boiler was off He said he was going to fix the problem. So about 30 min later I get hot water. It is now after 12am and i really wanted to get some sleep as I had a meeting the next morning early. Before I showered I used the toilet and when I flushed it, the water almost came out of the bowl. It went back down and I flushed it again to see if it repeated. It did. So now I am calling the front desk again. They send up the engineer again who confirms the toilet is messed up and wouldn't be able to be fixed that night. I told him I had had enough of this and was tired of all the disasters happen in this room and expressed that I wanted to change rooms.They put me in another suite. I decide I'm going to shower and deal with management in the morning as it is now after 1 am. I am begining to wonder if I am staying at a JW Marriott or the Holiday Inn The front desk manager that I was dealing with that night made no offer of concessions for all the inconvenience I had endured. The next day I get back to hotel in the evening from my meeting and go to the front desk to speak to the manager about the horrible night I had. The front desk told me that the manager would call me in my room cause they were not available. About 30 min later, I get a knock on my door and it's the shift manager. He hears all that happened to me and I asked him how was Marriott going to make this right as I was about ready to check out and go stay else where.He stepped up and comped my room for the night before, also gave me reward points added to my Marriott Rewards card good for another night stay at a Marriott property. Then he also said to go ahead and order a meal before I check out and he would comp it. I was very satisfied with what he did for me and enjoyed the rest of my stay in my new suite. The managers name was Rick Gary and he saved Marriott from losing a customer. I was just expecting my room comped for the bad night and he went above and beyond to make things better. I will for sure stay at this property again my next time in Buckhead.
1	Loved this hotel!. My husband and I spent the weekend in Chicago for our anniversary and stayed at this hotel. We were on like the 17th floor. The room was really nice and the staff was very accomodating. The hotel is very clean. We got stuck in traffic for 3 hrs in indiana on the way to the hotel and I called to let them know we wouldn't be there until midnight rather than 9pm. they checked me in over the phone, it was simple and took less than 2 minutes. The free breakfast is fruit, tea, coffee, water, and granola but it's free so no complaining. :) the room was bigger than I expected considering we were in downtown. The location cannot be beat! It was like 5 blocks from Willis tower and if you walk to the right from the hotel, you run straight into millennium park! The famous Chicago theater is just 3 blocks away. Hard rock cafe and portillos are like 7 blocks. Giordanos is also pretty close. Actually, everything is close. We did not pay to park at the hotel but parked at a garage across the street which was cheaper. It was less like 80 for the weekend, we parked our car and didn't drive again until we drove home. It's pretty easy to find the hotel and pretty easy to get back to the highway too.
1	Nice hotel, good location. The hotel itself was fine--accommodating and clean, and the room was spacious. I found the bed, however (a SleepNumber bed) very uncomfortable and couldn't manage to change the preset number. The restaurant was just so-so. The food wasn't very tasty. On the night we checked in I had a grilled chicken sandwich with roasted peppers and pesto that I thought would be really good--the sandwich was heavy on the roasted peppers but the pesto was almost non-existent. The following morning we had the buffet breakfast. It was a wonderful spread--fruits, cereal, eggs, potatoes, sausages, french toast sticks--but the pastries and french toast were stale and the eggs seemed very bland. On the plus side the waiter said that if we didn't want scrambled eggs we could have eggs made to order (we hadn't complained, he simply offered that). So I'm fine with the hotel in general (I admit the bed problem may be mine alone), but wish the restaurant was as good as the bed.
1	Superb Service and Excellent stay!!!!. What a great stay!!!! This hotel is extremely well located, near Union Square, Bart, Bus stops and major shopping areas. Room was very clean and with a modern decoration. Bathroom very spacious At our arrival, we were upgraded because it was our anniversary and there was even a bottle of wine compliments of the hotel waiting in our room. But service was SUPERB!!!. Front desk staff was more than Helpfull, specially ELLE, she was great, even helped us to get last minute tickets to see Placido Domingo at the Opera. Complimentary coffe at the room and the one offered at the lobby very good! This was my third visit to San Francisco this year, and this hotel was by far the most enjoyable. Now I found our Boutique hotel in SF, definitively coming back again.!!!!

1	Different. Hotel was clean and staff were friendly and helpful. We did have a unique experience while staying here. We arrived at our room at the same time as another guest and found the clerk had assigned us and the other guest to the same room (427). Front desk fixed the problem. Later that night, around 10PM, someone tried to enter our room. They could not as the deadbolt was set. Called the front desk and was informed they had assigned our room to another guest as they had no record of it being assigned to us. We had left the room for a couple of hours to attend a Braves game and were glad they had not done this prior to our return
0	Upon checkout, discover your room rate increased. Everything was good until we received our bill. We confirmed our reservation on the phone before arrival at 107 a night. At check in, we were told to initial next to our room rate of 107 a night. On departure date we discover there is a charge of 125 for the second night. We asked to see the card we signed when we arrived and it certainly did have 107 next to our initials in the top right hand corner, but over to the left in small print it said 125 for second night. So, here is another scam we must all be aware of, and worse, the person at the desk just turned his head away and said sorry about that. Actually, sorry about that right back to you, because we will never stay at a Homewood Suites again with such deceptive trickery. If you are still thinking of staying here, be aware that one side of the hotel faces Interstate I 4 and is extremely noisy.Hello rtwo dThank you for taking the time to share your experience with us. First and foremost, I'm glad that you enjoyed your stay. However, I'm also glad that you shared your concerns in this review. I have to apologize for the billing issues. Please know that we in no way participate/promote scams or any type of deception to our guests. We all make sure to inform all of our guests about rate changes when we make reservations and also during the check in process. Now, we will all make sure to emphasize this information even more to ensure that no one else has this happen to them. In addition, I hope that you decide to give us another chance in the future. It would be our pleasure to accommodate you and your family again. Take care and hope to see you soon.
0	The noisiest hotel I never slept in. Unfortunately this hotel had no sound barriers between floors. Noise from upstairs was constant and I did not sleep at all. Bathroom shower surround was damaged and doors were dirty. The best positive was that the room was clean and updated.
1	Location, Location, Location!!. This hotel is like being in Mecca if you're idea of Nirvana is shopping. It is very easy to locate in Seattle. The car valets were helpful and courteous. The front desk staff were prompt. And the concierge, well, he was the absolute best we have ever had. He had suggestions for shows, attractions, timelines, and restaurants. He even made suggestions for what to order off the menus!The room we had was a standard with a small queen. It was a corner room with 2 windows that opened to let in fresh air (yes, you need fresh air even in frigid February). It was a little stuffy without the windows being left open. I would say spend a little extra money and get a deluxe room with a king. The bathroom was also very small and not big enough for 2 people sharing! Definitely need either 2 bathrooms (as some of the more deluxe rooms have), or ask for one with a larger bathroom.However, we didn't spend hardly any time in the hotel as we were out and about so much.The location was ideal. One block from either direction of both Macy's and Nordstrom's (and about 6 Starbuck's coffee bars in a 4 block radius). Plus, just 5 minute walks from other name-brand chains. And close to Pike Place market and great venues like the Triple Door, and fantastic restaurants. Too many restaurants to choose from. All that means is that we will need to go back and try them all out. And we will definitely be staying at the Mayflower Park Hotel plan to make it 'our hotel' whenever we go to Seattle.
1	Such An Enjoyable Stay. Came to town for a funeral and needed a room on short notice to fit my family. They had an online book now special for 179. The location was perfect, as was the price! Front desk staff was polite, efficient, and professional. The room was clean and very nicely put together. The kids loved the pool, which we had all to ourselves in the evening. The concierge John always smiled and was so helpful. The parking garage was safe and had some great views out over the top of GA Tech's campus. I would stay here again and recommend it to anyone. Thank you for all the wonderful comments that will be seen with the thousands of visitors to Trip Advisor each day. Our entire team is delighted that your experience was memorable and many of our associates left a lasting impression on you. We will share all of your comments with our entire team and look forward to hosting you again in the near future should your travel plans bring you back to MIdtown Atlanta
0	Avoid this place. Run down. Pay for WiFi. No breakfast. No fridge. Ice machine is broken. No coffee in lobby. Just stay away. The only benefit is a a gas station next door and a casino a block away. Do yourself a favour and go somewhere else.MoreEd, We are sorry that you were unsatisfied with the expected amenities however, Motel 6 standards for quality are rooted in economical practicalities to consistently deliver on our goal to provide the lowest price of any national chain. We encourage you to contact our Guest...More
0	Getaway. Absolutely disgusting!!! I rather stay in my car!!! Everything about this place is gross.. including the rude staff. This is not the Tropicana and should not be promoted as if it was apart of it. I will NEVER stay here again!!! Broken mirrors, dirty towels, smelly smoky room, old food in the refrigerator from a prior guest, toilet paper was on the floor, shower was moldy, creepy old elevator that sounded like it was going to break down... JUST PLAIN GROSS
0	Best Western Plus Hacienda Hotel Old Town San Diego Ca. The room was clean and the staff was friendly. The way the rooms were set up made it easy to get turned around and lost. Because we got the managers special are breakfast was not included. I feel that happen because it was a full restaurant and not a buffet. I have stayed at other Best Western and that has never happened. I was very disappointed. Thank you for your sharing your experience. We never want anyone leaving our hotel feeling disappointed so for that, I am sorry. Regarding your question about breakfast, we offer a complimentary breakfast for those that book directly on the hotels website as well as AAA/AARP guests. We apologize for any inconvenience caused to you. If you would like add anything to your review or discuss anything further, please contact me through the hotel. I would welcome the opportunity to answer any questions you may have and hopefully win another chance to secure your loyalty! Thank you again.

0	Got charged, didn't get to stay.... We booked through Orbitz, which included a 'non-refundable' policy. We asked to reschedule (not cancel) due to a death in the family. Vertigo denied the request via Orbitz. We were disappointed that Vertigo couldnt afford more flexibility. Consider booking elsewhere if life might happen.Hi Mark N,I'm disappointed and sad to hear that Orbitz did not communicate your request to modify your reservation. Orbitz is the company that charged you and could refund your credit card directly as I communicated this to them as well. I wish you would have booked directly to avoid 3rd party issues with these companies and hope you called me directly so that we could have accommodated your request due to this unfortunate incident. Please contact me directly at 415-885-6800 and/or email me at jgonzalezhaiyi-hotels.com so that I can assist you in this matter.Jaime Gonzalez
1	Great hotel, great service.. A friend and I stayed here for the first time over Labor Day weekend, and were impressed. We were running in the Disneyland Half Marathon early Sunday morning, and we requested a 2nd floor room away from the road so we could go to bed early without being disturbed, and that's exactly what we got at check in. The rooms were very nice and clean, and the beds were sooo comfortable. Additionally, they were very accommodating of our weird schedules. On the day we left, my friend had a late flight, and they not only permitted us to check out an hour late, but gave us new key cards with pool-only access so we could swim and sit by the pool until it was time to leave. We will definitely go back, as we've decided that this is the perfect race-weekend hotel.We are so pleased to read you enjoyed your stay. We hope that we see you again next year for the next marathon. We thank you for your patronage.
0	The Customer is Never Right Apparently. I stayed at The Chelsea AC (8/24/12-8/26/12) and have to say it was extremely disappointing. A group of 8 of us were there celebrating a Bachelorette Party for my sister. I work in the client service industry and have to say that the inappropriateness and rudeness of select members of the Chelsea AC staff was almost unbelievable. I was told I would be contacted by the manager of the hotel (Ms. Terry --) and lo and behold, we were unable to access any messages on our hotel phone (room 314- the button would not connect and I heard a busy signal) during our entire stay and even the front desk was unable to access them. I booked two rooms at The Chelsea in the Annex back in February via the hotel website and when we arrived, we did not receive the rooms as described: Two Queen - Pool View Balcony. I called down to Guest Services and they were able to move one of our rooms to the appropriate description, but our second one was unavailable. Then, I was sternly told that I shouldnt have booked our reservations on the hotel website, that I was paying way too much and that they wouldnt even comp a 15 parking charge for the trouble. I truly felt that Guest Services did not have any concern for our satisfaction. In fact, they made me feel bad for spending any money at the hotel period.The rooms had holes in the ceiling, missing refrigerators, mirrors. Very ghetto. After our stay, I contacted Ms. -- via email and she agreed to reimburse me for the difference in our room cost. I received a measly 78.44 back for the entire weekend after spending almost 350 per night per room. I requested that the parking charges be removed as well and never heard back or received a revised folio after multiple follow up emails to Ms. --. Hence, why I feel compelled to write this review. Beware! The regular hotel (the towers) seemed pretty nice. The Annex is an old, moldy motel with rude staff.
0	Don't plan on going here again.. The carpet was dirty. Coffee in the morning was cold. Chain lock on the door was gone. Reserved it for three adults. Only two towels and no blankets or sheets for sofa bed.
0	worst experience ever. I hate to give a bad review but this was such a bad experience i would hate for anyone to go through what i did. I booked a room for me and my other half for valentines day, got us a kingsize bed with a water view, got to check in at around 5 but told they over booked and no longer had my room available, keep in mind i booked my room a month ago... i was givin a room with two queen size beds that felt like a full Bad start to my romantic plans, after getting to our room we decided to go eat at the hotel restaurant fuego where we were greeted with a rude host that said since we had no reservation we had to sit inside, we said that fine yoy can see the water from anywhere inside it seemed, then she says its 95 per person but didnt tell us why just handed us the menu and said its the valentine menu. Already irritated from check in, now this chick, we changed our minds and said we can order room service... got some food that took an hour to arrive and it was not the best for 100, 3 tacos a quesadilla 2 salds and 2 cokes. We then decided to go for a walk that was nice with beautiful views, we started feeling good after some wine and craved a cigar... know there is no stores close by you have to go back accross the bridge in your car to get anything like that. Overall bad
0	Friendly staff, good location, eh accomodatuins. Great are to walk for shopping and food. Price is reason and under 150 which is my work budget. One visit I walk up to a palmetto bug on my sink. I called the desk and they sent security to kill it. This visit the shears on the window were visibly ripped, but still up.Parking is free and easy, and from a sign in the lobby they will be updating soon.Fitness closet room has two treadmills and on elliptical.Dear Andrea G., Thank you for taking the time to share your recent experience at the Fairfield Inn Suites Atlanta Buckhead with us.

0	It was so bad, I slept in my car. (I wish I was joking.). This hotel is falling apart, and the staff doesn't seem to care. The first room we were put in had a broken AC unit, and the room it self was filthy. when I advised the hotel staff, they had me bring in a large industrial fan for the room. It was so loud that we decided we should change rooms.... More
1	good experience. Pleasant stay here with 3 friends for 2 nights. The location worked well for us. It is only about 3 blocks from Bourbon and they told us the best route to take at night down a street that would be more populated. We did not have any problems and we did not feel unsafe walking back late.The room was nice enough, cleanliness wasn't an issue, and the courtyard area was nice. One friend did complain of a loud noise during the night that disturbed her sleeping, may have been the elevator but she wasn't sure. The rest of us slept fine. We did not try the breakfast.
0	Poor Customer Service. I booked online Feb 8th for Saturday, April 9th. I got my confirmation email and put it in my travel folder. On Feb 10th I noticed a reservation in my computer calendar for Feb 9th not April 9th. After calling BW customer service they suggest I call the hotel directly because there was nothing they could do. I called and... More
0	Basically got denied service. While looking for a cheap place on the fly due to change of plans, I stopped by to ask if there were any rooms available for the night. I was addressed very rudely, and the woman at the desk was not helpful at all, saying that check out was at 11am and since it was already very late it wouldnt be a good idea, and that the only rooms available were very expensive incinuating that I couldn't afford it! And then told me that if I did stay there and wasn't out by 11am, they would call the police. I have never experienced such rude service and have been basically turned down, and it was very obvious it was based on race. Very sad and disappointing. Didn't stay at this motel, and never will. Any other hotel, would probably be better.
0	Dump. Do not stay here. Filthy. Sleep in your car if you need an alternative. The board of health should close this hotel down. The manager was rude, the rooms were filthy, smelled like smoke. Would not even sleep under covers.
1	GirlFriends Getaway!!!. My girlfriends and I celebrated there BIRTHDAY and Recovery in Bmore. It was our first time in the hotel. The staff was excellent especially the Manager(Rozellen) She very helpful in given us the best restaurant and clubs to go to..Only bad thing I didn't like was paying too much for valet parking it was very costly... But overall it was close to the harbor the other end by Fells Street which was great small local shops and bars. If you looking for different view of Baltimore this hotel is where u need to be.. We shall be back in June
0	Meh. Hard to say what I felt about this place. I came up and got a room with a balcony overlooking the river which was pretty awesome. Price was great too, can't beat 20 bucks. But the rooms were kind of weird. Old and outdated I guess. TV old and skippy. Can't imagine having to pay more than 20 dollars, I'm... More
1	Close to airport and I 5. This hotel is just off I 5 and a great location for visiting San Diego. At first glance we weren't sure it was a perfect fit for us, surrounding area seemed a little less than desirable, building seemed old, but Jesse at front desk was very kind and helpful. The rooms actually were very nice, very clean (my most important item) and laid out very well.Breakfast was really good, great variety, and the lady who ran the breakfast was wonderful. Very helpful and kind (helping a lady with her small children)Good Afternoon, Thank you for completing the survey regarding your recent stay at our property, and thank you for your compliments to the hotel and staff. We are glad your room was nice and clean for you, and we appreciate your feedback.If we can be of assistance in the future, please don't hesitate to contact us anytime at 619.275.5700.Sincerely,MadisonGuest Services Agent
1	Understated elegance. With an air of urban sophistication and a location that can't be beat The St. Regis occupies the corner of 5th and 55th only blocks from Central Park, MOMA and the best retail shopping in America. On a cold winter afternoon loaded with bags displaying the logos of the finest brands guests are greeted at the elevator with a choice of hot apple cider, chocolate or beef broth. Recently remodeled rooms are roomy by NYC standards and fresh and of course the Butler service puts it's over the top. I don't think you can find a better lounge for a casual drink then the King Cole Bar. Don't miss the Bloody Mary menu (a drink that was invented here). An oasis, a grand hotel, a total pleasure.Dear Gene B,Thank you very much for your kind words about our hotel. We are so pleased that you enjoyed your stay in a renovated room and were able to enjoy our holiday hot chocolate offering. We hope you have a wonderful holiday season and we look forward to seeing you again in 2015.Best Regards,Manuel MartinezHotel Manager
1	Great place to rest your head for DC getaway. We visited for a game at FedEx field and took some time to also enjoy DC. This hotel fit out needs for both. Wish the breakfast was longer during the week for those looking to get some shuteye since it was our vacation :) we opted for Starbucks across the street instead of waking for a buffet that closed at 9am. Shuttle to metro station was super convenient. One elevator broke leaving the whole hotel to function in chaos since the stairs were only for emergency. Carpet in our room was heavy soiled and in need of replacement. Only thing missing was a pool.....
1	Boutique type hotel in perfect location. Just stayed at Hotel Abri this past week end. The staff was amazing. Very friendly, attentive and shows an interest in your whereabouts. We had an Oasis Suite, and pull out queen size bed was comfortable. Bathroom is pretty good size with 2 separate sinks. Location is superb! Walk to China town, North Beach and so close to Bart. My only complaint thus the reason for Very good vs. excellent is the noise level. The suites face the street, and with construction in the area which starts up at 7:00AM, it was LOUD. Construction will go on for a while since they are building a bart station. There is a bar close by and the shouting/talking at night can be deafening. Ask for an inside room to avoid this disturbance. If you must have a suite, then bring ear plugs. Will return for sure!
0	Can't believe Marriott has adopted this policy at a premium hotel. I have seen this before in other hotel brands but shocked that the JW Marriott has resorted to HVAC manipulation to save a buck. You know where you turn the thermostat to 65 at night and the air blows at 70 (if you're lucky). Actually in our case it was turned down to 60 because we overrode the thermostat and called maintenance when this didn't work and the air still couldn't have been any cooler than 70. The thing about it is that the air was working because the room would cool off in the daytime. Apparently they're overriding the air temp from a master switch and putting a cap on how cool it will be at night. I'm sure this is to conserve electricity but why can't they do this in the daytime when people aren't in their rooms or trying to sleep instead of at night when people actually care about the temperature! Just be aware if you like your room temp below 70 you probably won't be happy here.Dear WullaB86,Thank you for choosing us for your visit. Our team strives to ensure an enriching experience for each guest, and we regret letting you down. It is disheartening to read that we fell short of our standards and we hope you will accept our apologies for the issues you encountered with the temperature of your room. We appreciate your patience, and we look forward to another opportunity to show you our commitment to quality and inspired service.Best Regards,Eb MbyeDirector of Operations
1	Treasure. Absolutely perfect. I am a young(ish) widow who returned to my roots in Atlanta for a reunion with dear friends two years after the death of my darling husband. This hotel was in a word, magical. The location was ideal, the atmosphere was serene, and the accommodations, although simple and basic, were so appreciated. It was truly my home away from home, although I felt more at home there than I do in my own home. Ive stayed in five star hotels in Europe that I did not enjoy as much as I did The Highland. I will not stay anywhere else ever while in Atlanta, until I move backJulie, Thank you so much for your review. It means so much to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us. We hope to welcome you back again soon.
1	Really nice hotel. We were put in the hotel by our insurance following and extended stay in OrlandoReception was quick and easy with Hector the receptionist being very helpful as I was trying to call my airline and let me use the house phone.Our first room was next to the laundry which was very noisy we went to ask if we could move and that was done quickly and efficiently by Hector.The rooms have just been refurbished and are very smart with a bed room plus a lounge area two flatscreen TV's and wonderfully comfortable beds, the fridge and microwave are also handy as well.There is a small but functional gym and an outside pool.A really nice hotel for an airport stop over
1	Great Stay!. I stayed on the 3rd floor in an oceanfront room on the end, which gave me additional ocean views on the side. The only little thing that could have been different was the bed. It was rather thin and not really comfortable. It wasn't much of a problem, but definitely could have been better. If it wasn't for the bed, the stay would have been a perfect 10 - excellent! The staff was really helpful and friendly, the room was clean, the shower felt great, and I had everything that I needed was there. It's convenient to restaurants and shops, and right on the boardwalk. I felt very safe and secure in this area (boardwalk, hotel, and surrounding community).It was a great stay, and I would definitely consider staying here again and recommending to others!We are so glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay and that our team took such great care of you! We do appreciate your feedback on the bed, if you could please let us know which room you stayed in we will get it fixed immediately. We look forward to welcoming you back again on your next trip to San Diego!
1	my visit in orlando. the hotel is awesome ,but around 800 last night I went to the bar with my husband and was totally ignored by one of the guys there he waited on several people around but never spoke or acknowledged me at all after 15 or 20 minutes another guy by the name of Keith asked to assist me . He waited on us with pleasure and made my night . I wanted to let him know people like himself are wonderful and I appreciate him acknowledging us and not have me leave the hotel with a bad taste in my mouth .SHOUT OUT TO KEITH ....THANKSAllow me to thank you for letting us know that you enjoyed our hotel. I am disappointed to hear that one team member did not acknowledge you upon arrival to our Sky Grille Restaurant. I appreciate your feedback I can assure you that the lack of acknowledgement and service was an isolated incident due we were busy. On the other side, Im glad Keith turned around your dining experience. Ill let him know your appreciation for his service. We take pride in our ability to make every guest feel special and would love to welcome you back as our guest if your travels bring you back to Orlando.Marlon Reyes, Food Beverage Manager
1	2 night stay. We were visiting our son and didn't realize the weekend we were able to travel was the same weekend just before the NFL draft and the Penn Relays. Rooms were few and far between in the city itself and what was available was more than double the usual price. So, we opted to stay at the Hampton Inn near the airport. It was an easy 17 minute drive to the city, free parking, and nice complimentary breakfast.Thank you so much for telling us about your recent experience at our hotel. We are so glad that you had a pleasant stay. We strive everyday to exceed our guest expectations. We look forward to serving you and your family in the future!Thank you for making it the Hampton Inn By Hilton Philadelphia Airport!Adrian Woods, Director of Sales
0	Terrible. I would never stay at this hotel again. My room in the south tower, 1927 was filthy dirty and it looked like the carpets had not been cleaned in years. The lamp was broken, the wall by the AC looked like it had severe water damage and probably mold. I woke up to cold showers every morning and the shower... More
1	What more could you want Hotel Sorrento makes for a perfect Seattle stay.. I stayed at Hotel Sorrento for 6 nights in September. I loved the character and charm of this hotel. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. It was 5-star service, particularly with the friendly doormen always assisting and welcoming guests.The lobby and fireplace room are so cozy and atmospheric. Loved the wine hour they put on each evening. Drinks and breakfast were excellent, too. When the weather cooperated, we enjoyed sitting outside around the fire. The location was perfect, a quick jaunt to the main attractions and the convention center, but away from the hustle and bustle. It is a downhill walk to Pike Place Market and surrounds.. so we enjoyed walking down there, walking around, and then taking Uber back to the hotel once we were tired. Also enjoyed being a short walk to Capitol Hill. We loved that they changed the carpets in the elevator each day. Just another example of Sorrento's panache. Our room was clean, quiet, charming, and comfortable. Loved everything about this stay!The word panache is simply not used enough! We love it as a descriptive for the Sorrento! Thank you for all the lovely feedback, especially in regards to the service. Our team wants to relay how much they value our guests, and we are always happy when it shows. It sounds like you were able to enjoy the best of both worlds during your stay. The Fireside is such a wonderful space for when it is cold or dreary and the Garden and the fire pit is such a treat when the rain decides to stay away. We couldnt be happier that you enjoyed your stay. We hope to see you again if you are in our neighborhood in the future!
0	Not typical Wyndham quality!. No A/C in the lobby/commons areas in JUNE in TEXAS.... elevator flooring was broken/peeling/popping up, and there was literally duct tape on walls holding parts together....room seemed OK at first, but curtains were not hung properly, (just dangling from rod) I had a large beetle in my bed, the chair in room was covered in red pen/marker, and seriously, there...

1	The Best stay I've had in Waikiki. Everything positive you've read about this hotel in the Trip Advisor reviews is spot on. I originally considered the Ocean Tower precisely because TripAdvisor had it rated so highly, and my wife was adamant that we should stay in Waikiki. Normally, getting around Waikiki is painful in a car because of the traffic, but since this hotel sits at the end of the strip, it is really easy to get to from the H1 by taking the King Street Exit. Anyway, the hotel is smaller than many I've stayed in, but that (and the incredible customer service!) gives it a very intimate feel. The rooms are good sized and are seemingly soundproof, which I really appreciated. The hotel is literally a block from the beach. The parking lot is small, but they immediately gave us the option to park around the corner at the large garage of a different hotel and that ended up being a less expensive option as well.The staff was wonderful, in particular Leonore and Terry. They really took great care of us (and I have to say it's nice when the managers call you by name everytime they see you). It was my birthday while we were there, and even though they sent some treats up to the room each day, on my birthday they sent champagne and glasses.We also got to tour the rooms that are being renovated, and I can't wait to go back once that is complete in the November timeframe. The new rooms have an ultra-modern, San Francisco/ Asian theme to them, and have all the amenities one could ask for, especially if you are a technogeek like me.Overall, I was incredibly impressed with the hotel and will stay here anytime I have business or vacation in Honolulu.
1	Great value, clean, nice rooms, helpful staff. This hotel was a pleasant surprise. Great price which includes breakfast and a happy hour with enough food for dinner. If you are trying to save money, and you have your kids or aging parents, this the place. Do ask for rooms in the new wing. Our first non smoking room in the old section, while lovely, smell of smoke. I asked for a new room, and they upgraded us into a suite in the new section. Super responsive to our request. The hotel is large and might seem impersonal, but it works for us... A base camp for exploring NOLA.
1	NICE QUIET LOCATION. Absolutely loved this hotel. Located in a quiet area 5 blocks west of Canal and Bourbon streets. Free all you can eat hot breakfast in the morning. Hors d'oeuvres served in the evening along with 3 free alcoholic drinks per person. However, if you do this, you lose the chance to sample all the great New Orleans restaurants. g But, if you are on a tight budget, this really helps to defray expenses.Trolley line is just across the street from the front door and it will get you to just about everywhere in the area.King size bed was comfortable with 5 pillows provided. Our room had a whirlpool bath. Front desk clerks are so pleasant and always smiling considering they seem to spend most of their time answering tourist questions. My thanks to Renaldo, Ayila and Star. I will definitely stay at this hotel next time I return. And I had so much fun in this city, I expect to return soon.OldTOm
0	Don't think we'll be returning.. We were not impressed with this hotel. When we reached our floor, it smelled like mold. The rooms were outdated and the bed was extremely uncomfortable. You could hear EVERYTHING coming from the hallway, so it was extremely loud. On the good side, it was a bonus that the beach was not crowded and that the rooms were very big.
1	Friendly Staff. Great value!. The check-in staff were friendly and very helpful. They took my husband's Hilton Honors number and gave him credit for the stay and provided us with free water and breakfast. I don't understand why he didn't get points but I didn't ask. The hotel was beautiful and updated, although the tile in the bathroom needs updating. The breakfast buffet had lots of options, including an omelet bar. The wait staff were extremely helpful.Dear guest Mary Curtis M, I would like to thank you on behalf of my team at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport for your kind comments on our performance and your experience on your stay. We are looking forward to welcome you, family and friends to once again provide you with an outstanding level of service and nothing less. Sincerely,Alex BlancoGeneral Manager
1	Hip By The Bay. A nice take on a boutique hotel in the Fisherman's Wharf area. Very good location in the middle of all the attractions down by Pier 39, Ghiardelli Square, Cable Car turnaround and the F Streetcar Line. Really interesting decor in the main lobby, like the reuse of shipping containers. And a great courtyard area with plenty of seats, fire pits and all kinds of things to do.A good, clean and comfortable room. Rooms facing the courtyard (like mine) have balconies, nice views out to the Bay. No bigger or smaller than other hotel rooms in the area, but nicely updated decor.Helpful staff - efficient and knowledgeable. Nothing fancy, just good. Maybe trying to be a little too hip, but can't fault people for trying.Didn't mind sacrificing two nights worth of points.Hi mastiffdad,Thank you for taking the time to write about your recent stay at Zephyr!mastiffdad, I am very happy to hear that you found our location to be so convenient, we really have the best location of the Wharf! Hip by the Bay, as you describe us, I love it!! Yes, we tend to think we are kind of cool, but it's awesome for us to hear our guests think the same way! we are so proud of our yard, the game room and all the fun and creative design we have around us...I love to know that you were able to enjoy it all!mastiffdad, we are looking to see you again soon!Warmest regards,Carmen CruzGeneral Manager
0	Share your room with roach or bug. Roach in the room but the staff said its just a bug not a roach, like that made it any better. Big hole in the bathroom wall were this bug/roach came out of. Wonder what other rodent will come out of the wall.Thank you for providing us with your feedback. I would like to apologize for any of the inconveniences you may have experienced during your time with us. I wish that I had been notified of your concerns before you had checked out and I would like to apologize on behalf of our staff.
0	Not a good stay. We stayed here for one night before heading to airport. Positives first, the room was big with kitchen and sofa and so one. But it was very noicy. Even though our room was at 8th floor, the traffic is keeping you awake. And if that...MoreAloha, and thank you for taking the time to share your review. We are pleased to hear you enjoyed our spacious accommodations, but are very disappointed to learn about the other aspects of your stay that were less than exceptional. We sincerely apologize for any...More
1	Everything done well.. This is not a super luxurious hotel with expensive furniture and fancy rooms. But for what it is, a chain with the usual rooms and extras, it is everything one could ask for. We were checked in by a pleasant and helpful clerk. The room was clean and quiet with a microwave oven, refrigerator, a large TV, and free WiFi. We used the laundry and fitness room facilities which were modern and clean. One of us chose the standard breakfast (coffee or tea, two eggs, sausage or bacon, toast or hash browns), offered at the Denny's next door, which was free. The other got 5 toward one of the other breakfasts offered on the menu. Both were satisfactory. We would stay there again.Thank you for your review and we will see you on your next visit to Napa.
1	Lush and beautiful!. Enjoyed a 3-night stay as part of a 6-night trip to La Jolla. The valet team greets you upon arrival with a smile and a cold bottle of water. They also assisted me with my luggage and were incredibly friendly and helpful with pointing out the hotel restaurants and amenities along the way to my room. The grounds are incredibly gorgeous- flowers, succulents, and greenery galore! While the property is quite spread out, I found that getting from my room to the other side of the property never took more than 3-5 minutes. The room was spotless and the pillows and bedding were far superior to even my own at home! I can't tell you what a comfortable night's sleep I had! The spa is small but tranquil with a friendly, helpful staff. The pricing for services was actually pretty reasonable compared to many hotel spas- a 50 minute massage starts at 115. The property is not in walking distance to beaches or shops, so be sure to rent a car if you choose to stay at this property. Downtown La Jolla is a 10 minute drive, La Jolla Shores, the aquarium, and various shops and restaurants are only 5 minutes away.
0	Foundation issue for some rooms. The hotel looked like it was in good condition, after entering my room, I noticed that everything in the living room and kitchen was a bit slanted which didn't really bother me. The floor was sloped causing everything to be slant, an obvious foundation issue or very poor construction. While I was in the bedroom, I heard voices and thought someone had entered into the suite, turns out it was people talking in the hallway and because of the slope, there was a 2 inch+ gap between the door and the floor. I was only staying at the hotel for 8 hours, so I didn't ask for a room change, but beware of what room you get.
1	Charm and Friendliness Make Up for the Age of the Building and the Parking. Located in an up coming section of Buckhead, this somewhat older hotel sandwiched into a compact space shows some wear and tear, but proves to be a great find with exceptional front desk staff, helpful security, efficient and friendly breakfast and housekeeping staff, and an ultimately convenient location. Apparently quite popular with the business travelers, the hotel can get very busy and parking is a challenge during the week, but they seem to handle the volume and guest needs pretty well. They have a reliable shuttle service, great breakfast spread, and the place is consistently clean and welcoming. The room showed some signs of wear and had a damp feeling, but was outfitted nicely. I'd definitely stay there again for the price and convenience.We are delighted that you enjoyed your stay. We are also happy to announce that we will be undergoing renovation soon and updating the hotel. Thank you for taking the time to right this review! We look forward to seeing you again the next time your travels bring you to the Buckhead area.
0	Terrible hotel overall.. The hotel is poorly maintained, common areas like elevators were unkept, the breakfast was poor and in a bad location, and there was an infestation of bedbugs. The manager refused to talk to us even after two calls.
0	Worst ever !!!!!!!!!!!!. Room was nasty falling apart poorly kept up it ended up being the worst stay ever if it wasnt the only thing available for a big concert weekend we would of canceled .the door had electrical tape covering up around the door knob , the locks did not work, we only had one light that worked,the microwave was covered in... More
0	Fire Hazard and Gross. This has to be by far the nastiest and unkempt hotel I have ever seen! There were stains on everything...The shower curtain, chairs, wall and bed spread. Some of the staff was very rude.... Not to mention the power outlets have electrical burns and a prong was stuck in a ground plug outlet. Nothing that is claimed in the description... More
1	Close To The Beach.. and now My Heart - Ocean Tower Resort. We have just returned from 10 days at the Aqua Ocean Tower Resort in Waikiki Beach, HI. While this hotel would not be your choice if you are looking for luxury, it is extremely clean and the staff was so friendly and helpful that we considered them friends upon our departure. There were 3 of us - we stayed in a room with 2 double beds, and had more than enough room for our stay. The location of this hotel is KEY! It is only 1 block from the beach, as well as most trolley and bus stops. It is within walking distance of the Honolulu Zoo, Aquarium and many of the shopping plazas and restaurants. We never even had the need to rent a car!! They are currently in the process of renovating their rooms. Even when you were in the room during the day, you did NOT hear the renovations being done on the other floors. Renovations on all floors are to be done in June 2007. We had the opportunity to take a look at a couple of the finished rooms. The new rooms are absolutely BEAUTIFUL! You feel more like you are in your bedroom at home than in a hotel. While this was certainly not the most lavish hotel that I have ever stayed in, it was quite possibly among the best hotel experiences that I have ever had. I will definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and family for any trips that they plan to Oahu.
1	Classy hotel. For a romantic night away from home, my spouse and I chose this lovely hotel. We visited hete 3 years ago and it looks like the Renaissance Waverly has been completely renovated. Our room on the 11th floor had a nice lilac motif. Nice and spacious with an exceptionally comfortable bed. Large bathroom with a tub sizable enough to actually take a bath in. Nice indoor pool ( the outdoor pool wasn't open yet for the season. ) Two large weight rooms are available, too.We enjoyed the breakfast buffet and l loaded up on the wonderful fresh blueberries. Great hotel!Thank you for the review, come back soon!
1	We liked everything about this hotel from the moment we.... Good: We liked everything about this hotel from the moment we arrived till we left. We were greeted by Mia a very friendly and helpful receptionist. We were given a lovely room overlooking the Boston marathon finishing line with views of the Trinity church and Boston public library. We found our room to be very clean with plenty of space and a very comfortable bed and a great sound system.On our first night we went to their wine and cheese tasting event which we found to be great fun and a great way to mingle with the locals. The staff play a great role in the success of this hotel under the brilliant management of the very hospitable Jefferson who by the way makes a great cocktail especially our favorite the Bloody Mary. We would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel as it is right beside public transport (T) and the airport shuttle drops you across the street. We also found we could walk to most of the tourist sights. The complimentary continental breakfast was a bonus. Thanks Charlesmark for a great few days, hope to visit you again in the near future
0	Clean but noisy. The room was nice and clean. The only downsides were the A/C system and location. The A/C system was very loud and did not cool the room adequately. The location was right next to the freeway onramp (noisy) and the neighborhood was sketchy. I will not stay here again.
1	Lovely Hotel and Staff. The manager, Len, and his entire staff are always welcoming and professional. This is our home away from home in San Diego. The owners are always on top of maintenance and it seems they are constantly making improvements and upgrades to this family-owned property. Beautiful landscaping, a sparkling pool, good breakfast and comfy beds with nice linens. Dog friendly too.Thank You Ann KWe are grateful to have so many happy repeat guests, both two legged and the four legged kind!It's a wonderful compliment to hear a guest say this is their home away from home, and I am proud to share your review with our staff and ownership.

0	Disorganized and NOT a 4 star property. The hotel was old but fairly well maintained. I would not call it a 4 star hotel. Our problem had to do with the shuttle pick up after a day of being at Summerfest. We were told that the shuttle would be at the designated pickup area every half hour, so we were there a little before midnight. I decided... More
1	First Class. Great Hotel, Great Staff, clean rooms and everyone has a smile on their face! I spend half the year on the road primarily staying at Hilton brand hotels so I feel my review is a pretty good barometer of what you'll get here. One of few places where ALL the staff is friendly, professional and genuinely wants to make sure you have a great stay!Thank you for choosing the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport for your accommodations. We appreciate your loyalty to our brand and are so glad to hear that your stay with us has always been exceptional. It is also great to read you loved our friendly associates who took great care of you and that you were impressed with your well-kept accommodation. Thank you again for being our valued guest. We look forward to your next stay with us soon.All the Best,Debra Thompson-FrenchGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport
1	Awesome Family Trip. Visited NYC for first time with family of 5 for a double birthday celebration. Booked a park view suite with club access. Room worked great For The kids with additional rollaway bed. We had an amazing view of the park and everything was right out the front door. Club lounge provided great service and easy breakfast lunch snacks and drinks. Fantastic club staff filled every request. From the moment we arrived the doormen knew my kids by name. Gave us apples for feed the horses one night after a carriage ride. The ritz always does a super job for our family but these guys really have their act together!
1	Convenient, pleasant and well run in the Garden District. Tired of expensive big box hotels downtown Stay in the Garden District -Quiet, lovely with lots of good restaurants, lovely houses and you can take the streetcar downtown in 20 minutes. The St. Charles is a great choice - it was comfortable, a good breakfast and helpful staff. I was really glad I stayed here instead of the conference hotel - cheaper too.Eric,I love our location! The Garden District is so much quieter than the French Quarter, but there is still plenty of things to do! Thank you for writing your review! We hope to see you the next time you visit New Orleans!Kathleen Davis, Front Office Manager
1	If you don't let fear of the neighbours put you off, you'll get a great deal. The people who run this place couldn't be nicerThey explained exactly which areas to avoid after dark, and what we need to see in SFFollowing the lady's advice, we had a great timeNo rooms were on the ground floor and there were security measures for lift access, so we had no qualms about securityThe room was impeccably clean, and we even witnessed them changing the sheets before the second night of our stayLack of A/C was a bit of a problem as it was unusually hot during our stay, but that shouldn't be an issue most of the timeBed was comfortable, shower was excellent, and they give you lovely soapWe discovered a great place for breakfast - the Olympic Flame CafeIt's about a 10-minute walk towards Union SquareWalk to Geary Street and take a right. The cafe is on the right, opposite the Adagio Hotel (fancy architecture) a couple of blocks before Union Square
1	Best Western - Anaheim - A great place to stay. Family suite was huge and more than enough room for 6 adults and 2 toddlers. Room was very clean. Very close to Disneyland. You walk across the parking lot to the Paradise Pier hotel. Very Economical price compared to hotels at Disney.Thank you for your recent stay with us at the Best Western Plus Pavilions. I am glad you enjoyed your stay and our Family Suite. Our suite is definitely large enough for families and we are thrilled it worked out for you and your family. Thank you again for your stay and we hope to see you again on future trips to the Anaheim area.
1	Very nice hotel and staff. This hotel was an excellent choice as the location was near Orlando Sanford International Airport just a hop and skip away. The hotel looks nice and is very clean. The staff go over and beyond to help you with anything you need. One of the maids got me hooked up to the internet when their computer was offline, I joked that she should be paid more for being their go-to IT person! Fantastic breakfast!Dear Rhea S.,Thank you for providing us with your positive feedback. We're happy to hear that our property helped to enhance your stay. I am thankful to have a great team to work with and I will make sure to recognize them and their hard work at the next meeting. We hope that you will come again soon.
1	Great location. We were visiting San Diego for a few days and stayed at the Hotel Solamar, which was situated in the 'Gas Lamp' area. This was a great location for getting around, eating out and sight seeing. Although the hotel didn't t have its own restaurant, it did have a bar/restaurant next door. Plus there are lots of local cafes for a great breakfast. The only thing we were surprised with was the parking. The hotel only offered valet parking at 45 per night, however there is a multi story car park just down the road at 15 a day, we didn't use our car whilst there and only paid 30 for 2 nights parking instead of 90.I have to say San Diego was a fabulous place to visit and recommend the 'old town trolley tours' to see the sights. A visit to Coronado Island is a must...beautiful.Thank you for the 5 star review 25mary25! I'm glad you loved our location as much as we do! JSix is the restaurant for the hotel, I can certainly see how that can be confusing with the entrance not being right inside the hotel and off the driveway. I hope you are able to try it out next time, you'll love it! I'm thrilled to see that you had such a memorable trip to San Diego, I hope you come back and visit us again soon. Cheers! Shannon
0	Review. The room is small and hot. It was quite warm and stuffy in the room. It was old and run down. There is no individual bathroom for the room. However, this location is the dream. It is a 2min walk from Powell train station and 2min walk from Union Square. Close to many food places. It is approximately 30 min fast walk to Fishermans wharf or 10 min tram ride. The location is outstanding and I suppose you get what you pay for in that aspect. Wouls stay there again for a 1-2 night basis but any longer would not be ideal.
1	Great for kids, Friendly staff. I thought the staff were very friendly, with an exception to one of the female pool staff. Perfect place for the kids though. We had an incident were our youngest got sick in the car, the front desk went out of their way to help, and within minutes helped me make an appointment for cleaning. They also recommended touring, although the touring company turned out to be a disaster! The downed elevator was a bit annoying. We read in a review that there was a cockroach in one of the rooms, and it was too bad that we also saw a quarter sized one in the breakfast area! We quickly told the kids it was a beetle. When I told the front desk about it, they were very apologetic and credited our parking.
1	Convenient to the Cobb Convention Center. The hotel is convenient to the convention center, connected, and a number of great eating places within minutes of the hotel. The the only drawback was the shuttle service, on every occassion but one it took over 15 minutes for the captain to find a driver, in 2 instances I had to show the driver how to get to the restaurant. These were just across the street at the Cumberland Mall.Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. I will review with my Front Office team and ensure follow through. Hope we have the chance to have you back with us soon!
1	Ideal for cruises. This is one of the only hotels within close proximity of MCO that provides shuttle service not only to and from the airport, but also to and from the cruise-line we went with. I didn't even have to rent a car, everything was available for me and my wife. Thanks again to the Hilton Garden Inn for great service and the complimentary upgrade on our honeymoon.First of all, Congratulations to the couple! We appreciate your wonderful feedback regarding your pre Cruise stay as it proved to be great start to your honeymoon. We are happy that our location close to the airport as well as the cruise terminal was perfect for your needs with the scheduled shuttle service we provided to you. Thank you for your gracious remarks, we do hope to host you and your wife back next time you take to the high seas, or perhaps to stay in the Orlando area.All the Best,Charles StephensAssistant General ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando International Airport
0	Worst Hotel Stay Ever. I was going there for a convention and Hotel Anatole was sold out. The closest available hotel was Extended Stay. Booked it because ratings show 3.5 stars. Well, this is false. This hotel does not deserve more than 1 star. It has roaches, and I killed two or three of them. The carpet was extremely dirty with burnt mark and foul smell. The bed was not comfortable. It is definitely not a deluxe hotel. This is not a home away from home.
1	Nice Hotel, worth the price!. I stayed in room 336 for the weekend. Nice quiet room away from elevators ice machines. Since it's near the end of the hall, not much walk by traffic either. Besides the usual guest room door closing I didn't notice any noise from either side. As a woman traveling alone I felt completely safe at the Hilton. The fire pits were fun at night, the bartender was really nice along with the rest of the staff it made for a relaxing stay. I would also like to thank the Hilton for providing a dedicated, well lite smoking area for those of us who still do. Thanks Hilton!Please accept my appreciation for your wonderful feedback regarding your recent stay at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport. I am so pleased that you felt we were successful in meeting your needs and expectations. We strive to reach this goal for all our guests and seems we were able to achieve this during your stay.Thank you again for your comments, I will definitely share them with the team and thank them for a job well done. We do look forward to the opportunity of welcoming you back soon! Sincerely,Alex BlancoGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando International Airport
1	Perfect location, lovely hotel and fantastic staff. We stayed as a family of four the first part of Thanksgiving week. I knew that there would be renovations going on during our stay, but it did not impact us in the least. You wouldn't have even know they were renovating. The hotel is in a perfect location, one block off of the main street in the Gaslamp Quarter so you may walk to many restaurants, shops, the stadium, the convention center, Seaport Village and even the USS Midway. The manager Shannon is lovely and made sure our stay was perfect. The front deck staff was exceptional. George and I believe Tim were always available to give us directions and to give us great recommendations on nearby restaurants. We were traveling with our two teenage boys and they knew just where to direct us depending on whether the boys were going to join us for our outings. The bellboys/door attendants/Valets were always at the doors greeting us with a smile and an open door. When I asked one of them if they ever tire of opening the doors and smiling he responded with a smile and said, never. Also, a fun thing that you can do before you leave home is send them a few photos of who you may miss while you are traveling and they will put print the pictures and put them up in your room. Fun surprise even for the teenage boys. (I sent photos of our dogs.) We love the Kimpton Hotels and this was no exception. A lovely hotel in a great location with an exceptional staff. Also, their restaurant the Jsix was fantastic, we dined there with the boys and shared many starters, salads, sides and a charcuterie board. Probably the most delicious fun meal we had in San Diego. We will definitely stay at Hotel Solamar again when we head back to San Diego. Thank you for making us feel so welcome, we truly enjoyed our stay.Judith, you are very welcome! We truly enjoyed having you here, I am thrilled that you and the boys had such a wonderful visit. We can't wait to welcome you back. Cheers! Shannon
0	You get what you pay for!!. Very disappointed in my visit! There was no iron or ironing board so I went wrinkled. They false advertised free breakfast in morning because they just switched from Days inn to home stay so they didn't have license to serve food yet. I will not be back
1	Interesting and fun hotel to stay at. We stayed here the summer of 2017. This is a interesting hotel. With a multilevel villa layout. They have a fountain courtyard area. There is also a restaurant up on the hill with a great view. The rooms were decent size and clean. Our room was in the building across from the lobby and we had to walk a distance to find the breakfast area. But the breakfast buffet was very good with lots of choices. We enjoyed staying at the hotel and eating at the restaurant and the buffet breakfast. We will stay there again when in the area. They also had a fun little selfie area where you can get a family picture and it sends it to your phone or email.Thank you for highlighting ambiance, cleanliness and our breakfast buffet at the Old Town Tequila Factory as the reasons you would be inspired to choose us again. We sincerely enjoyed hosting your San Diego visit! Regards,Ryan AguinaldoGeneral Manager
0	Great Hotel - Unless You Plan on Sleeping at Night. The hotel was obviously last decorated in the 1980s. It is definately NOT A RESORT! The work-out center was dirty. The pool was much smaller than the 1980s brochures depicted. The brochure shows someone sitting on the island. There is a sign indicating that you must stay off of the island. There is a young girl in a raft in the swimming pool on the brochure also. That is laughable! A female bartender (description: Caucasian w/ longer brown hair-sorry, all I've got) was EXTREMELY RUDE during EVERY INTERACTION! The comforter had a blood stain on the side that sat on the pillows. The outside of the balcony door was completely rusted. The room door was paper- thin. We heard every normal volume conversation that went on outside of the room including the ones that occurred at 3 a.m. Truly, we were awakened several times during each night, just by conversations occuring in the hallway. The noise level was by far, the worst part of the stay. We got very little sleep.
1	Great Stay, Great Value, Great Bed. Thus place is awesome! We went to New Orleans for Christmas just to visit and the staff were super friendly, the hotel was very clean, the room was spacious, the bed was super comfy (and for me to say that is amazing) and the Kick Back is a great deal as well. What more can you ask for than free drinks (3 per person per evening) and free food that could be your dinner if you aren't planning on visiting a restaurant. Everything about this stay was great. When I come back, and I will, I plan to stay with you guys again. I know the hotel industry is tough and no one likes working Christmas anyhow, but everyone had a smile on their faces the whole time. No Grinches!
0	Bad Experience. Upon arrival the lady acted like it was an inconvenience to get up from the desk in the back and wait on my at the counter. She laid the keys on the counter while working and I noticed it said 222. I asked if that was second floor and she said yes. I told her I had requested a first floor when making the reservation two weeks earlier and she stated they didn't have any rooms on ground floor available very matter of fact. She continues with check in, never mentioned breakfast like they always have in the past. We unload and walk the small hike to the room. At 3:10 a.m. my husband jumps and startles me awake to find a rather large roach crawling on his face.He slaps the roach to the floor and chases it and gets rid of it. He calls the front desk to let them know what has happened and the man that answers the phone stated he would have maintenance take care of it the following morning. We then stay awake the rest of the night until time to leave for the hospital. He couldn't sleep thinking another roach was around there. I checked out the next morning and asked for the number to the corporate office and they never asked what was wrong, just told me they were owned by choice hotels. We have stayed at this hotel many times when it was Holiday Inn Express through my husbands illness we were in Atlanta a good bit off and on and never had a complaint but this was a very miserable night and we don't plan to stay at this hotel again. They could have at least acted like they cared about what was going on. This stay was on 7-17-2012.
1	We switched hotels to here and were pleased!. We moved to this hotel from two doors down and were extremely pleased. The rooms have been renovated in the past 2 months and were clean and fresh, albeit small. I recommend buildings 1,2, or 3. The grounds were lovely and calming and the pool was clean. Downsides: No continental breakfast, slow internet connection, a microwave didn't come with our room and the shuttle times weren't great for young children. Also, the TV channels were extremely limited, and there's no DVD player, but you can pay for Disney shows or Curious George at 4 each episode. We walked over to Bunz for food which was better than the restaurant. Great location, close to everything, but you need a car.
1	Guppys place or home away from home. We are a family of 5 with 3 teenagers children and we just finished a 6 nights stay at the Inn and it was such a great experience. The Inn is cozy, with very nice rooms and great service. The staff is very amicable and you almost feel like you are staying at friends house. The breakfast is excellent and available from very early in the morning (Marty you could invest in a 4 slots toaster :-)) and the views of SF from the roof terrace are stunning. Also the location in the Mission district is ideal. We will certainly be back.Oh I almost forgot to mention the best part: if you are lucky you get to meet Marty (the owner and a fantastic person to chat) and Guppy, his adorable adorable little dog.A four slot toaster it is! Guppy loves you too. Thank you, Marty
1	nice suites. We enjoyed our stay very much. Our only complaint is that the night manager seemed a little hostile. Our room was right above the hotel office and she sent the security guard to give us a hard time if my 5 year old daughter and my 12 year old niece made too much noise for her. The security guard was always polite and apologetic and seemed to understand that she was being unreasonable. All the other staff was extremely freindly and helpful, and the facility was niceDear Y5041VXdavidh,Thank you for your kind words regarding your stay at the Hawthorn Suites Dallas Park Central. We were glad to have you as our guest, and appreciate you taking the time to comment regarding your visit with us. I am concerned with you comments with regard to our night staff, and have addressed them with the team as well. Please know we take these kinds of comments seriously. We look forward to the opportunity to host you again the next time you are in the Dallas area. Thanks again for being our guest! Best regards, Charlie Westhoven Operations Manager Hawthorn Suites Dallas Park Central
0	Keep looking. I spent 2 nights in this hotel with friends for a bachelor party. It would have taken very little for this hotel to meet our needs and it still fell short. The room was old and in need of renovation ( no big deal on that one) but when we arrived all the lights didn't work. We quickly found they... More

1	Great place to stay. Located on Pine, near the Convention center, this hotel is first class. The rooms are nicely appointed and very comfortable. Compared with other major cities the prices are reasonable. It's easy walking distance to local attractions, plus it's just a short walk to the Monorail station that goes to the Space Needle.Thank you so much for your review! We are so glad that you enjoyed your stay and that the room and property amenities made your stay a great one. It is a wonderful thing that our central downtown location allows our guests to easily shop at the flagship Nordstrom store, Pacific Place as well as hop on the Monorail and quickly get to the Space Needle. We would love to welcome you back on your next visit to the Seattle area.Sarah S.Guest Relations Manager
0	Basic, basic motel style. Across street from Disney is the only good thing.. Parking is awful (super tight space they charge you 8/day to park). The rooms are old beds are hard, but it was clean. Front desk..basic no-nonsense. Super small eating area in the morning offered cheap donuts/muffins. Cereal/milk for kids apples/oranges is the only good thing. Coffee is ok, tho styrofoam cups are super small :( Please, paint the rooms, change the carpets and update the linens! all the (old) window a/c's leaked water on the walkways :( Only reason we stayed is, they were the only one with vacancy when we called. Next time we'll walk a little further if it means better accomodations.
1	Home away from home!. I stayed at Hilton Garden Inn for a 3 day Sales Seminar and had a very pleasant and comfortable stay. The friendly staff, clean room and overall property look made me feel quite at home. I wished I could have stayed a few more days to enjoy all the amenities even more. I will definitely return to Hilton Garden Inn in the near future. KindlyThank you for your complimentary words regarding your stay at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport. We are delighted that you loved your well-kept accommodation, our friendly associates as well as all the other on-site amenities that we have to offer. It was our pleasure serving you, and we look forward to your next stay with us soon.All the Best,Debra Thompson-FrenchGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport
0	Hilton Hamptons Slowest internet of any brand. I use the net for work and this Hampton inn has theirs set so slow it is unusable. And no this was not prime time. If you need bandwideth do NOT stay here. The download speed is only 90K, that's a Kbyte not an M. Try a Marriot brand maybe you will have better luck.
1	Lovely hotel shame about the tramps !. This hotel was lovely , super clean with amazing rooms. Sea view rooms are to die for. The downside not of this hotel, but the area is that there are so many tramps in the area. Being situated right on the sea front the tramps congregate round the public toilets which are right outside the hotel. They do not hassle anyone though which is ok. There are a lot of homeless people in San Diego due to the weather ( as a local told us) , it was a bit of a shock to see so wish I'd been informed b4 we went there , hens I thought I'd put it on here. If you are in this area , please make use of the Bike Ride that you can do around the area , a great way to see the area. We are so glad that you enjoyed your stay, your room, and the ocean views! Thank you for taking the time to provide us with this feedback. We look forward to welcoming you back on your next trip to San Diego!
1	Very nice hotel well situated in New Orleans. Hotel is older but quite nice. Staff are friendly and helpful. Rooms are well appointed and quite modern. There is a bit of traffic noise from the street (I was on the 3rd floor) but this is to be expected downtown in a major city. (plus I was there the day the St. Patrick's day parade occurred, and its route took it right by the corner of the hotel). I didn't use the restaurant but it looked very decent. It's quite close to the various things to do or a quick cab ride away if you don't want to walk. I would certainly stay there again.Thank you for the great review and for your visit to the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans! It certainly was a pleasure hosting your stay. If we can be of any other assistance in the future, please let us know. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
0	Yup - only if you're desperate!. I was trying to save money when I booked a room here for three nights. The only good thing I can say is it was inexpensive. The bathroom sink was literally falling off the wall. They never vacuumed or cleaned the sink the entire time we were there. They did replace a used washcloth each day, so I know they... More
0	not worth the over night stay.. Just needed a place to stay for the night. Nothing fancy. When I arrived took 45 min to check in. There was another person and I trying to check in only. The man at the desk keep stopping to help everyone who would walk in leaving us just standing there. Even if it was just talking to the random that were walking in. When we finally checked in, there was nowhere to park. People who had rooms on the other side of the hotel was parked on our side so we had no place to park. My husband had to pull behind someone to get our stuff out then drove it to the gasstation and asked if we could park there for the night and he had to walk back to the room. Also, there was a party going on in the next room which wasn't that big of a deal cuz they weren't loud or disturbing us but because of the party they had this man that stood in front of our door trying to sell us drugs as soon as we walked up. Everytime we walked out he kept on. I have a 10 year old daughter that was with us. Called the front to let them know of this man and the guy at the desk just laughed and said oh yea he's here often, he won't bother you. UM I'M CALLING BECAUSE HE IS BOTHERING ME. Worst hotel I ever stayed at.. and I've stayed at some terrible hotels.
1	Met expectations. Very happy with stay.. This is a no-frills hotel, but perfectly met our needs for our recent long-weekend. We went between UCF (15min away) and Disney (35min away) so it functioned as a perfect location. There were tons of restaurants, gas stations, and fast food places along the same road. A Walmart Neighborhood Market (grocery store for those of you who don't know) was about 10min down the road, too. The front desk staff was pleasant and check-in was easy. The 25 deposit was credited to my account immediately after checkout, too. Our room was clean and up-to-date. The towels were nice. Water pressure in the shower was also great. The mini fridge was really cold and the microwave was functional. My kids did take time to enjoy the pool, and they really liked it. It was clean and just the right temperature. Overall it was a great stay. We would definitely stay here again. Thank you for providing us with feedback regarding your most recent stay with us. It's great to hear that our property was perfect for your stay and I'm glad that you would consider staying with us again. We hope to see you soon.
0	very dirty. this motel is disgusting visible dirt, everything is falling apart, mold. there were blood stains in the sheets and blankets, so nasty u can't go barefoot, worse of all no refunds and the manger is lazy
0	COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. We booked a wedding block for a group attending a near-by celebration. (Thank goodness the hotel wasn't the wedding venue). From check-in to check out, the experience was a fiasco. Guests didn't get the right rooms, rooms weren't made up room amenities (like shampoo and toilet paper) were non existent and took staff over an hour to bring restaurant was... More
0	Tiny room, less than great location!. I LOVE San Francisco but this place was not a highlight. We waited for almost an hour just to check in (checkout was not much better) and in that time 3-4 different people made complaints ranging from no hot water to toilets being blocked (2 Toilets), the receptionist handed them a plunger to deal with it themselves!! When we finally got checked in we had to go accross the road and up steep narrow stairs (which I fell on twice) to get to our room which was not much bigger than the queen size bed in there. Their free wi-fi only works in the reception area and the breakfast a danish or muesli bar (only allowed 1) was very lacking!The neighbourhood left A LOT to be desired, I did not feel safe. It is in a bad part of town and is not local to the shopping area.This is one place I will not be going anywhere near EVER again.Dear Guest,You did book the smallest and least expensive room, however, it is very clean and well-appointed and does have a TV/remote, coffee/tea maker with condiment package, iron/board, hairdryer and a closet area however, you are correct, those few rooms do not have good internet connection, thus the lower rates. San Francisco is a very compact city and land is limited and we really can not do anything about that fact. We do have a very clean hotel and we do our level best, and it is clearly indicated that we have two buildings opposite each other, we market our hotel honestly and have done our level best on accuracy. We are also in a quiet street where the main Police department and all the superior courts are located just in a 2 block radius, and 4 blocks to the main cable car station, visitor center, SF Nordstrom/ Bloomingdale shopping center, our area is known for fine restaurants, lounges and cafes - SoMa District. Wishing you all the best.
1	Unique Spanish style multi-level hotel just above Old Town. The hotel complex is spread out onto several different buildings and levels, including the parking garages, pool level, plazas and walkways joined by many stairways and elevators. You will need your property map and directions from the front desk, but for me it is worth discovering the beautiful plantings, fountains, plazas and vistas on the different levels.If climbing stairs is an issue make sure your nearest elevator is working and you don't have a room in the one building without elevator access.The breakfast buffet is generous, but for me the best part of the Tequila Factory restaurant is the several open or glass enclosed terrace dining areas which have wonderful views of San Diego harbor and Point Loma in the distance, both in the morning evening.When I visited in October there was an hourly shuttle to the airport and some local landmarks as well as on request pickup from the airport.We're honored to receive your review! As a seasoned traveler and reviewer, you know what it takes to make a hotel stay into a beautiful experience. Thank you for the eloquent descriptions of our property and the photos you attached. They make a nice addition to our Tripadvisor page. We hope your travels will bring you back to Old Town soon. Please let me know if I can ever be of assistance. Enjoy the season!Regards,Ryan AguinaldoGeneral Manager
1	Rooms With a Price. My 4-star rating is based on the quality of the room and customer service, which was very good. Staff (other than the heavyset girl at the coffee bar) was phenomenal, and very accommodating. As for the coffee bar girl, she was quite friendly with the men in front of me, but gave me attitude because I asked for a sesame seed bagel. Her response (quite haughtily) was, Those AREN'T sesame seed bagels, we ONLY have everything bagels. I asked for the bagel toasted. It was not very busy, and she began to busy herself with the tip jar. I noticed that my bagel had popped out of the toaster and she did not move to retrieve it. I mentioned that the bagel was ready, and she gave me this LOOK, like, I'm busy, OK She put down the tip jar and handed me my bagel. Later that same afternoon, I walked past the area and she once again gave me the same haughty look. Also, 40 a day for valet parking! Luckily, we were able to find parking next door for 20 a day (which happened to be where the hotel valet parked your car!). Of note, the valet told us that the 20 rate required parking after 12:00 noon, and moving the car out before 12:00 noon the next day. Once again, good service/tip. Moving the car was no problem, as we took a drive to Coronado in the morning, and returned in the late afternoon. In room, a complimentary 16 oz. bottle of water every day if you have housekeeping. Otherwise, everything else is a charge. Only one free movie channel, all other movies are pay per view. Gaslamp area is at least 5-6 blocks away. Some areas seemed more safe to walk through than others to get there. Suggest State Street to G Street, then take G all the way to 5th (Gaslamp area). The walk to the embarcadero not bad. Just plan on doing a lot of walking. However, the trolley stop is just a block away, so easy to get to other places like the zoo and Old Town! We could hear the trolley at night, which my husband thought was cool, as he thought it sounded like thunder. All in all, it was a good stay.greysquirrelGirl - Thank you for the detailed review. I am happy to hear you enjoyed our location and all that we have to offer. It is unfortunate to read of your experience with one of our staff members, as this is far from the norm, and I sincerely apologize it left the impression it did on you. We are known and recognized more frequently for our great customer service and we strive to ensure all our guests leave feeling better than when they arrived. I hope you will give us another try, as I am confident we would earn a 5 star rating from you. Remain Well, Alyssa TurowskiGeneral Manager
1	Ocean Park Inn--fantastic place on Pacific Beach. Our family had a front row seat at the Ocean Park Inn Hotel on San Diego's Pacific Beach. The rooms and service are comfortable, clean and friendly and the location can't be beat. You're right in the middle of great beaches, boardwalk, restaurants, night-life. I'd stay there again, for sure! Steve from Sammamish, WAThank you for taking the time to write us a review, Steve! We're so happy to hear your family enjoyed their San Diego beach vacation with us. If you start missing us and can't get back down here, check out our Facebook page for local pictures, events, and hotel updates! Thanks again.
1	Very good, but not the best. This place does a lot of things right. However i can't justify the price of the hotel. Price should be way less , i know its san diego but still. I know the price spikes up during the summer but its still way too much. I went for business and leisure both very expensive times.Thank you for being a loyal guest of our Best Western PLUS Hacienda Hotel Old Town. While it sounds like youve had overall pleasant experiences, were sorry to note that you feel the overall value is lacking for the rate. Were sharply competitive with comparable hotels in and around Old Town but as you said, the rates can fluctuate with the seasons and special events. Feel free to give the hotel a call direct to confirm that youre getting the best rates we offer. It also pays to book from our hotels official website. We hope to hear from you. Enjoy your summer travels! Regards,Ryan AguinaldoGeneral Manager
0	It could use some updating.... I want to first say that this hotel is in a prime location. You are steps away from the trolley pick up for city place and clematis.

0	Disgusting. I stayed here for one night because the official hotel for the Trenton Half was booked by the time I knew I would need a room. I've had good experiences at other Comfort Inns so I figured this was a safe choice. When I walked in the lobby looked like it was under renovation. Not a big deal. What was... More
1	Very nice and reasonable. We recently had the opportunity to travel to New Orleans and we chose to stay at the Whitney based on user reviews, location, and price. The room was very nice and was really clean. The hotel was well decorated. The one big call out I have is that the restaurant accepts room charges and cash only! As a rule, I won't support a business that doesn't accept credit cards for payment. Valet parking or a paid lot across the street are your parking options.Thank you for recent visit to the Whitney Hotel and for your kind comments. I'll be sure to pass this along to the staff. Please let us know if you need any reservation assistance in the future. Thank you, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
1	Favorite Marriott in Seattle. This is my favorite Marriott property in Seattle. The location is hard to beat and the water views are worth the great sunsets and I love watching the seaplanes come and go. Many great food choices are in this area, with even more coming to Lake Union. Nice remodeled lobby and breakfast area. Staff is always super friendly and you have to love the extra points game they offer at check in. I'll be back soon!Hello TruckeeTroutTraveler,We greatly appreciate you taking the time to share your wonderful feedback about your recent stay at the Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union.

0	Barebones Hotel. This hotel is barebones, ugly, and has zero amenities. The people were nice, it was clean, and the location is decent for someone who has business in the Loop. However, there are multiple other hotels right nearby that are much better.
1	3 night stay. A nice clean hotel, a little away from all the attractions but a nice friendly hotel. At the time of our visit there was some refurbishments going on, but did not cause any problems. Do not expect any views from this hotel as it in the middle of the town.Dear hylton h,Your comments about your stay with us are much appreciated and we thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us!

I was traveling to Atlanta on a short business trip, wanted to find a hotel close to where my meeting was taking place with a superb obeisance, decor and a touch of class. I found that with Atlanta Waverly Hotel Convention Center-Renaissance, I've never stayed at this property before however, I assure you I shall return. Nevertheless, my first contact was with Angie over the phone, very professional and pleasant, a lost art, and rarity that you receive both I expressed to Angie my concerns and needs and she simply said Sir, you've come to the right place, I'll ensure your stay is a pleasant one, I'll take care of it. She spoke with such confidence and enthusiasm, she delivered Angie did not disappoint my room was superb, it was exactly where I needed to be, floor level, location, and exactly what I needed, Angie met all my expectations and much more. The Waverly entire staff and property during my stay were simply superb the property is astonishing the breakfast buffet to order is super. And they offer you a great late checkout time if needed. Well done Angie, well done your hard work you do day in and day out does not go unnoticed...thank you for ensuring I had a pleasant and most satisfying stay and much more......LeonThank you for the nice feedback, we appreciate it! I will be sure to thank Angie for setting the tone from the beginning. We hope to see you back soon!
1	Mardi Gras Vacation. We had a wonderful stay at the Whitney hotel. The front desk staff headed by Patrick were the best that I have ever experienced. They were extremely helpful in making reservations at great restaurants, guided us through the craziness of Mardi Gras and were always friendly and helpful in every way. The rates were a good value and the location was ideal.We're so happy to hear you enjoyed your visit to the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans. Thank you for taking the time to write such a glowing review and for mentioning the wonderful service Patrick provided. I'll be sure to let him know. We look forward to hosting your next stay!Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral ManagerThe Whitney Hotel
0	Decent but nothing exciting. The hotel is decent but lacks pizazz. Its kind of stuck in the 70's. However its still clean, functional, and a budget friendly place to lay your head for a night or two. Dont expect a lot for what your paying. Your not going to pay much so your not going to get much.
0	Visiting Punta Gorda!. The staff were attentive and welcoming. The river view lovely. The room was not comfortable. The bed needed replacement as did the linens. The space was taken up with long shelves w pillows. Seating would be better .
0	Smells bad. First, make sure you are booking the hotel you want. There is another Comfort Inn (Zoo / SeaWorld area) nearby and it has a better rating than this one. At this one we reserved a kid's suite, however, they do not seem to have a room as pictured on the website w/kid's bunkbed. So you buy a room and get another one that is dirty and smells bad. The staff at the reception is courteous, but the cleaning people seem to make a special effort to make you feel uncomfortable.
1	Wonderful Experience!. We stayed at this hotel for four nights on our honeymoon. We had a King suite with Jacuzzi tub, internet included, microwave and refrigerator. We got a great deal and the room was beautiful. The hotel property is well maintained and inviting and the staff is friendly and helpful. The courtyard/pool are lovely.The location was perfect for us. It is only three block from Bourbon Street and the entire French Quarter and Garden District are both within walking distance. The breakfast was great! Sometimes when you hear continental breakfast you think stake doughnuts and bad fruit - this was not the case here. Each day had eggs, breakfast meat and bread or potatoes. In addition fruit, yogurt, toast, bagels, waffles, coffee, juices and water were available. We liked to start our day with breakfast at the hotel while we reviewed our plan for the day. It also helped cut down on our food costs.My only suggestion - if you have a room on the first floor bring a fan. The noise from the courtyard can travel and if you are a light sleeper this might be a problem for you.
1	Good but a snafu with breakfast room service. Good location in the heart of Buckhead. No real views from the rooms. Mine looked at the parking garage. Beds were comfortable and the staff friendly. I ordered breakfast from the hang tag menu. Got a call in the am that they didn't have the cereal I wanted. I just had them deliver me coffee and a banana. Of course I got a pot of coffee with no cream or sugar. And they ended up charging me for it. A call to request the charge be removed took care of the issue, which was very helpful.
1	beautiful, convenient location. Brand new hotel in brand new retail area on the water. Easy to access off the beltway. Friendly staff, clean rooms, comfortable beds. Only complaint is that the full offering of the Hampton Inn breakfast was not available at the two times we came down (at 7am and 9am on a Saturday). The food at 9am had been in the bin too long. Still more choices than the continental breakfast at other places, including make-you-own waffles and yummy egg burritos. The fee for parking in the community garage was free with room key and even included a convenient room key drop upon final exit. Pool but no hot tub.
0	Crazy over priced!. This is an old style motel with external doors that has had the rooms redone. They are improved with the newer style bedding, but the room we had was not well cleaned, even found crackers along the baseboard of the wall. The walkways are mostly outside and the concrete is cracked and in poor condition. The breakfast buffet was served... More
1	Not Just an Airport Property - fantastic modern lobby and top staff. The L-train stop (on the Blue line) is only a 5-minute walk away from the hotel, if you cut across the parking lot.The staff couldnt have been more helpful and their various kindnesses were greatly appreciated.I had an amazing suite with plenty of room to stretch out. The bedroom area contained a lovely Marriott bed and the large main bathroom had a powerful shower with plenty of space for products and two sinks. There was also a bathroom adjacent to the main living room area. Both of the flat-screen TVs had loads of channels (Direct TV), which was a big bonus.On the first night, the Exec lounge was closed due to some maintenance issues, but I was given a voucher for a free appetizer in the bar, complimentary soft drinks and free buffet breakfast in the restaurant the next morning (which was excellent and of a very high-quality).As promised, the next day the Exec lounge was open again in the evening. It had a good selection in the morning including a couple of hot items and several different types of bagels. It was busy though, due to a Pepsi conference being held in the hotel.I loved the outdoor pool and patio area, although it closed after Labor Day, which I thought was a pity during a Chicago heat wave. The indoor pool remained open during my stay.Strangely, on day 2 of my booking, my room was never made up. When I informed the staff, they nearly burst out crying and quickly sent up extra amenities and cleared away my overflowing rubbish bins.There is a large grocery store across the street (Dominick's) and several restaurants within easy walking distance.The free shuttle service took about 15 minutes to get to the airport.I look forward to staying at this property again the next time I'm in the Chicago area.4 out of 5 stars
1	Best Western Review. I was surprised to see granite countertops and modern room for the price I was paying. My kids even commented it wasn't a cheap looking room. The free buffet breakfast was great. The staff was very friendly. There was a great restaurant next door for lunch and dinner. The lounge was very cozy. I felt very safe. They provided free parking were your car was in a locked parking lot. They gave us a remote control to go in and out of gate. We just had to remember to give back the gate remote. The hotel gave a friendly note under your door the morning of check out to remember. I will definitely stay again.
0	SeaWorld Trip. Nice lush landscaping, nice pool. Close to freeways and gas station. Stayed in room 315. The kids liked having their own space. Hard to take a shower, no or low pressure. Air conditioner didn't seem to be working. I called front desk, girl said they hadn't had any complaints! Seriously I'm calling! Was so hot for 3 nights! There was a stand up fan so I assumed they knew the AC wasn't working. Breakfast was blah. Make sure you have time because the breakfast area was packed and they take FOREVER to replenish the hot foods. Overall, my stay was fine. Kids were happy. Dear AlexLisa02,Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to share your comments.I would like to apologize to you and your family on behalf of the hotel for failing to meet your needs.We understand our hotel is in need of a LOT of TLC, so sorry (We are due for a full renovation in the next couple of months in which we'll have everything in those rooms replaced and upgraded.i hope you will give us a chance to serve you again very soon.Warm regards,Laura Benson OP ManagerComfort Suites MV
1	Good stay. This is my 4th or 5th stay at this location and it has gotten better with time. Recently renovated and much cleaner and newer now than when I first stayed. Unfortunately, they seem to have also increased the price a bit since my first stay and this was unwelcome as the price was important to me in choosing the hotel.We at the Best Western East Inn Suites wanted to thank you for giving us feedback regarding your recent stay with us. Our staff is proud to know that each time you have stayed with us your experience has only gotten better, and we hope it will continue to do so. We do apologize for the increase in price, but we it was necessary since we have renovated our property. However, we do enjoy having you as a guest, and we do hope to see you again at our establishment soon.
0	Un pleased. This was by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. The rooms where not clean. The showers did not work well( went from hot to cold, then hot then cold) I had to unplug the tv to plug in the microwave because they did not accommodate for both. Just an unpleasent experience. Certainly wasn't worth the price .
1	Great location, though the area may be too busy for some.. My girlfriend and I decided to go to San Francisco, and after some investigation into the matter, we settled upon the Kensington Park. We tend to stay at hotels that are fairly priced for their location, such as Bill's in Vegas. I'm not a fan of super splurging on hotels, but then again, I'm not going to save a few bucks if it puts us in a rather unpleasant area. After our stay, I have to say it is 99.9 positive with only a few minor issues.Located just off the main intersection of Powell and Post, Kensington Park is in a great location. If you're a fan of The Cheesecake Factory, as my girlfriend is, you will absolutely adore this area of town, as the restaurant is on top of a Macy's building no more than 5 minutes walk away. There are many other restaurants within that area, and there is little doubt that if you do not find anything within the immediate area, you can find something just a few blocks away. The hotel is also a few minutes walk from many posh boutiques, Chinatown, the Financial District, as well as the famous Cable Cars. Public transit is also very accessible from this location, with Geary and Market St within walking distance as well, and was a very good base of operations for the time we spent in San Francisco, as we were mainly focusing on the Northern areas of the city (Bay/Golden Gate Bridge, Golden Gate Park, Ocean Beach, Chinatown, Japantown, Legion of Honor, Fisherman's Wharf, and Alcatraz).Getting to the hotel was a breeze. We simply (well, simply after finding the station) hopped on the BART, got off at Powell, and headed North to Post St. Due to the popularity of the area however, actually navigating Powell and making it up the hill with luggage in tow can be a bit of a challenge. I can't even begin to imagine the difficulties one would encounter should they have children along with them as well. It should also be noted that there are several homeless people along this route. However, they do not do anything that would cause a nuisance or disturb the peace.Once we arrived at the hotel, we were greeted by a very luxurious, old school classy, dark coloured lobby, completed with a piano, and several comfortable couches. Once check in was completed, we went to our room which was furnished with your typical hotel items, minus a fridge and cooking implements. Most important of all, the room was clean, which is something that is of importance to most people. In terms of the bed, it's difficult to quantify the level of comfort, as this is a person to person thing. I will say that the bed is a bit on the soft side, which may or may not be to your liking.Naturally, being in such a great city, we didn't spend much time in the hotel room, other than to sleep at night. Each time we came back, the rooms were tidied professionally, with any minor messes we made taken care of. The front desk staff were equally friendly and approachable, and were accommodating to the strange requests that I made of them. One final item of note is that light sleepers may want a room away from Post St, or perhaps consider a hotel not in this area at all. As luck would have it, Post is a one-way street, and just up the street is a San Francisco Fire Department depot, and because of our room, we could hear/see the trucks whiz by every single night. Despite being 7 floors up, there is still quite a lot of noise. Similarly, I'm guessing there is a Police Department or something in the area, as we heard those noises every night as well.All this boils down to the bottom line: would I stay here againIf the rating didn't quite spell it out for you, the answer is yes, assuming I'm doing stuff in this part of town, and I don't want to rent a car. Given the prices of all the other hotels in this area, Kensington Park offers one of the best combinations of location and price around.
1	Hidden Beautiful Ranch style Hotel. We had such a great time right after the Christmas parties and family gatherings at work, home. We had a beautiful room in the new decorated section, the food at Mustangs Burros was delicious. We enjoyed our champagne at the front desk very much:) The breakfast was delicious I had the Bread pudding which we were told by Jose that this will take a while to bake, we were fine and looked forward to the bread pudding. It was a Frittata made with Crossants ..yum.Gaby the concierge was very helpful and gave us some information for a possible wedding for our daughter. Later that evening we returned to our room to a bottle of Cabernet wine. We were very grateful to the all of the staff at the Estancia Hotel and we look forward to returning to this wounderful hotel. I almost forgot the front desk lady Erica was intuned to all of our needs, and the vallet young man made sure we had a map to our next location and gave us some water bottles for our journey. You all are very considerate. Thank you again.Thank you so much for the 5-star review and the kind comments about our wonderful staff. We are very lucky to have such a great team and will be sure to share your review with everyone. Please let us know if we can help with your daughters wedding, our Catering team is absolutely fabulous. Just give us a call when you are ready. (PS Im definitely craving the breakfast bread pudding now!)
0	BLOOD SMEARED ON THE WALL. They literally could not pay me to stay here again.Rewind 24 hours ago...check in seems fine. The place has a musty smell and everything is extremely run down - but okay, fine, its one night. Go to an elevator behind the diner. The elevator is barely in service. There is a blinking neon sign that reminds you that this is definitely not a 4 star hotel. The walls and carpets are drab/dark and the lighting is dim.First room we go in, okay seems fine, upon further inspection a GIGANTIC hole in the wall. Called the front desk and they could not have seemed more apathetic. No, OMG we are so sorry! Instead there was okay we will change it... fine....Second room, smells like ciggarettes but okay. Another smaller hole in the wall, but everything else seems okay. We go out, come back around 1 get ready for bed and lie down. Fiance and I cannot sleep with out noise so we turned on the AC - only heat came out, so we tried to sleep without it. Think again! This is where our nightmare began - you will hear every noise in atlantic city. From a bum sneezing, to some frat kids screaming, to some bachelorettes flirting with the frat guys I think I heard it all. I ended up going in the hall way and screaming some profane things at them.Cut to 5 am..this is still occuring. In fact, one of the frat guys smashed into our door with his entire body and screamed oh S*it I finally gave in and went to the front desk and asked them if they could do something - they sent two security guards (who to their credit were very nice) but could not do much to help. NEedless to say, we checked out immediately. The manager could not do much but gave us a credit. I Will be disputing the charge on my credit card. My favorite part - as we were walking out, blood was smeared all over the wall! Guessing it was one of the idiots that decided 5 am was a good time for a hallway wrestling match.IF you are thinking about staying here - think again! It is dirty, disgusting, run down and nothing like the pictures on the website. I actually think the fact that they even have those pictures on the website has to be illegal/unethical.
0	Never again. Just look at the photos no others words are necessary ... This is in Radford VA, don't know how this place went down hill from a year ago. Moving in a college student in all day, getting to the hotel to this ...
0	Convenient Location - but THAT's ALL!. I stayed last year and room was great. This year - complete opposite. The mattress was bad, the sofa was stain with who knows what!!! It was just a filthy disappointment - as I highly recommended this hotel based on my experience the prior year. I WILL NOT RETURN to this hotel. However, the staff at the front desk was friendly - the only good thing about this stay!!
0	Truly unprofessional, did not match their high ratings on the internet. I was going to be in downtown Atlanta for a convention and had to check in early. Looked at their website and called the local phone , followed instructions for 'in house reservations' (btw the voice mispronouncing Centennial is hilarious) to have our reservations confirmed. We had 2 rooms and the woman identified herself as Karla said the rooms are... More
1	Pleasant Surprise!. I recently traveled to Orlando for business, and booked the Hilton Garden Inn because that's where my co-workers were staying. I was surprised that such a convenient location to the airport was such a scenic hotel. We loved sitting out in the garden area at night with a few cocktails, and the pool was a really nice gathering place as well. The breakfast each day was really, really good. Standard buffet, but they also had a chef that would make omelets, french toast, pancakes, etc. which was really nice. The staff was very friendly and the room was great. It has a Keurig coffee maker, refrigerator, and a microwave....awesome! You won't be disappointed!Dear Guest mefuntravelgirl, I would like to thank you on behalf of my team at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport for your kind comments on our performance and your experience on your stay. Every single employee of this hotel prides themselves in the quality of their work striving for 101 to exceed our guest's expectations every day and make them extremely satisfy with their stay.I want to thank you for your loyalty and support. We are looking forward to welcome you, family and friends to once again provide you with an outstanding level of service and nothing less. Sincerely,Alex BlancoGeneral Manager
0	Worst Experience of my life.. I will not be using expedia ever again this Hotel was a dump and if this is what you guys deal with I don't want any part of it. I didn't stay I just lost my money because there was no refund so they said. so thanks for nothing.
1	Best location in town.. Granted the rooms in this hotel are not enormous but the high standard of service and spotlessly clean rooms make up for it. The location was perfect and the huge lounge area filled with computers that actually work was a great access. The front desk staff were charming living up to the reputation of customer service. The other great asset was the fact there was door located between the hotel and the restaurant next door. It rained one night during our stay so we were happy to take advantage of the restaurant which incidentally became our choice of breakfast venue as well.Dear JulieThank you so much for so many kind comments and observations.I am delighted that you had such an enjoyable stay with us and were well looked after. I am glad that you also enjoyed the Elephant Castle restaurant, it offers great value for money, service and very convenient opening hours - especially for the night owls. Come see us again soon.RegardsPAul TiernanHotel Manager
0	Disappointed with Stay. Hotel experienced a fire in one of the rooms. While I understand that this was not avoidable from the hotel staff, i was surprised when I checked out. I had to stay in the parking lot for about an hour and 1/2 after midnight. When I checked out later in the morning, no rate change was made or bonus points... More
0	Will Not Go Back Ever. The maid never came to our room. I reported this to the front desk no clean towels, the bed was not made, trash not emptied, etc. Active smokers were outside on the balconies, which is the only way to get to the rooms, day and night. Spend a few extra dollars and find another place down the road.
0	Closed for remodel. From all outside appearance this facility is closed for remodeling as well as restaurants. Great location. Hope it is open on my next visit to NOLA. Lots of eating places in the area. Have to do minimum of 200 characters but not sure what more I can add to IT'S CLOSED!!!!
1	Staycation. The Vagabond Hotel is a charming, comfortable option for a Miami stay. The pool tucked in the center of the hotel makes it seem like a hidden oasis. The spacious rooms have everything you need and the staff is very friendly. The pool bar is a total bonus. Sebastian and the rest of the bar staff are very nice and attentive. The place has a cool, hip vibe but with out the South Beach attitude. I would definitely come back here for another weekend getaway and recommend it to people looking for a fun, easy place to stay in Miami.So glad you selected the Vagabond for your staycation! The locals have discovered how relaxing it is to hang out by the pool during the day and enjoy the pool bar and the entertainment on Friday and Saturday nights. We look forward to welcoming you back!!!
0	Door Left Unlocked, Wrong Credit Card Charged. Housekeeping left my door unlocked, and at the end of my stay the staff charged the wrong credit card. The people were pleasant, but if I had a choice between brusque staff who did their jobs properly and pleasant people who did not, I'd take brusque.Paul M,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor. I sincerely apologize about the inconveniences during your stay and will use your review to make the appropriate changes to improve our guest experience. Your feedback is essential to us and we hope to have the opportunity as our guest once again. Sarah Junge
0	Tiny noisy place. Our stay here left us dissatisfied and uncomfortable. The hotel is very small lobby and when we arrived there at 10pm they have only open the small window for the contact and this reflects insecurity for the place. The room is very old and lack proper maintenance. Breakfast is very disappointing for what the cost they charge at over US200 a night. Not recommend. We are very sorry to understand that you didn't thoroughly enjoy your stay with us, and that you were not entirely comfortable here. We are very sorry that we were unable to meet your expectations, and we hope to have the opportunity to redeem ourselves in your eyes. We would love to welcome you back soon! Best wishes, Hotel Management
1	Good space for rate. A standard not fancy hotel that provides a little privacy and extra space at a good rate if you want an affordable suite. Decent pretty big breakfast buffet (could someone figure out that 15 of us don't digest dairy and really like having something like soy or almond milk). little pool only good for kids. Nice big lobby and lounge areas.Jesse L,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor. We value the feedback from our guests and are always striving to improve our guests stay. Please let us know when you return as wed love to welcome you back as our guest.Sarah Junge

1	One of the best experiences. Everything was absolutely wonderful. The design of the room was a bit too industrial for my taste, BUT the layout of the room was awesome! I never felt cramped, AND we could not hear the other guests PERIOD. Kudos for the prompt attention when we discovered wine glasses outside the other guests door. For me the pillows and bed were the best! Too bad I didn't sneak a peek at the label.Thank you so much Viola for the wonderful review. We're so happy to hear that you had a great stay. We hope it's not the last time you visit.
0	Leo, family. This Hotel does not give you a welcoming feel, the staff is not friendly the rooms smell, beds are not comfortable. I stayed in a BW in North Hollywood the same week and it had breakfast and did not smell very nice. Thank you for your review regarding your recent stay at our property. On behalf of our entire team, we would like to apologize for not exceeding with your expectations. Please know your comments will be shared with the appropriate Department Heads and Staff for specific training purposes, as guest satisfaction and meeting their expectations are quite important to us. We hope that you will consider staying with us again, so that we can have another chance to provide you with an excellent experience. Thank you!
1	Great quiet place in great location.. They had a full hot breakfast every morning open as late as 10AM. The location was close to the freeway. Lots of parking. The staff was friendly. The location was close to Sea World and the San Diego Zoo. It took only 15 minutes or less to get to the Zoo. Close to Costco for gas, etc and right across the freeway from Pacific Beach. It was very quiet, no freeway noise or doors slamming.Good Morning,Thank you so much for taking the time to review your stay here at the Best Western Mission Bay.It is wonderful to know you had a nice stay and were happy with your time here. I will pass along your compliments to our central location and to our staff that works so hard every day to make sure that your stay with us is always a good experience. Thank you again and we hope you will come back and stay with us again soon! If I can provide with any assistance, please dont hesitate to contact us at 619-275-5700Sincerely,MadisonGuest Services Agent
1	Made me feel like I was visiting friends that I hadn't seen in a while.. Upon arrival, we were greeted by David. He helped get us settled in our room and even suggested a mexican restaurant within walking distance of the hotel (which was wonderful). We had a room on the 2nd level with full ocean view... which was GORGEOUS.On our final night, Sachin gave us several suggestions of things to do and places to see. We barely scratched the surface and plan to return and stay OPI... They really made us feel welcome.Thank you for the kind review! Your review will be taken into consideration for the aforementioned employees during the next performance review. We're looking forward to seeing you again!
0	Good price but dark, a bit dirty, poor TV, low shower, saggy beds. The hotel is safe and basic. The good points are the hot tub. The rooms are old and need remodeled. They have the basic dark walls and dark bedspread and really old bathroom. Tall people will need to bend over to wash their hair in the low shower. There was a fridge. The outlets were very poor. I had to... More
1	Low rates, great location and great service. For a low-budget hotel this is very classy, especially at 45/night through hotels.com. I stayed there five nights for a conference and parked downtown for 5 - 8 per day. There is also convenient public transportation. The staff is the friendliest and most natural I have ever met.The bed was a little soft and there was no bureau for clothes, but I would return every time rather than pay 2 - 3 times as much. The neighborhood is truly funky and laid back, Cafe 640 next door has wonderful cuisine, and there is a good coffee shop one block north. You can afford to pay for good coffee at these rates.
0	Disappointed. We arrived early we were told we could check in at 11:30. We went did some running around came back. We were then told we couldnt check in until 1:30. Once we finally checked in we were told we had to put down a 100 deposit. That was not said when we booked the room. We were given a room with no view (houses) when we specifically asked for one with a city view so we had to go back downstairs get a new room. There was no refridgerator, no coffee pot, no microwave. We wont be back there. We could have stayed somewhere else that was on the strip for the same price and gotten more ammenities.
0	Terrible. Dirty, tub drain did not drain and brought up stuff back into the tub which is yuck!!! A/C did not pull moisture out of room so everything I mean everything was damp from carpet up. Worse stay I have ever experienced. Housekeeping did not clean outlet room for a two might stay and we had to ask for clean towels twice.Thank you for submitting a review about your recent experience at our property. I wanted to sincerely apologize for the issues you encountered. We take a proactive approach providing our guests with the highest level of service, cleanliness and safety. We hope you give us another chance the next time you are in the North Dallas area.
1	Electrical Contractor. The Best Western Inn at the Vines is conveniently located to the main entrance of the Napa Valley right near across the street walking distance to multiple places for shopping, entertainment, gas and dining. I had an easy relaxing time at this Hotel. The hotel staff were friendly informative and always helpful with my questions. The room was modern, clean and quiet. There was also a restaurant on site with a discount for hotel guests. I really enjoyed my stay and plan to return on my next trip to the Napa Valley.Shawn R - Thank you for your kind review. Our location is very conveniently located close to shopping, restaurants and the downtown area. We are thrilled your stay with us was so satisfying and look forward to seeing you again.
0	Terrible hotel. Worst Hotel I've stayed in, Non smoking smelled of smoke and my eyes were burning. They gave handicap room shower head not high enough and no sink in bathroom not what was expected, air conditioning unit noisy horrible
1	Strategic Location, Free Food and Cheap Parking. My family enjoyed our stay here. This hotel is located a few blocks away from the French Quarter and a block away from St. Charles Streetcar. It is very accessible you can walk to and from French Quarter from day to night without any problem. You can also go to the Garden District by taking the Streetcar without any hassle. They also offer free breakfast, free dinner (and some cocktails) and free snacks which are a major plus. This helps a lot especially when you're on a budget.If you're driving to NOLA, this hotel offers valet parking for 25 + tax. The other hotels' parking costs around 35-40 so this one offers a pretty good value. It's actually difficult to find a parking space in French Quarter, so I advise for you guys to just walk. But, we did drive one time when we booked a swamp tour.We liked NOLA a lot and we're definitely coming back! Next time, we won't have to scout for hotels because we would rather stay at Drury Inn again!
1	Excellent home away from home. Housekeeping was my saving grace during my stay at this hotel. There is nothing like coming home to a clean room (603). This the hotel Southwest Airline selected for us and I think they did pretty well. The location wasn't all that great but we weren't there for pleasure this was a business training trip.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for taking the time to fill out the Trip Advisor survey. I will be sharing your comments with my staff. We strive to make each guest enjoyable. We hope you will select our hotel when your travels bring you back to Dallas. Enjoy the upcoming holidays!
1	Great Hotel!. We was looking for a hotel that was nice but wasn't expensive and I found just that at the Aloft. I made a reservation and when I got there It went so smooth I was up to my room in less than 5mins and I had a preference to check in at 11:00am and it was granted with no extra charge. The room was very nice and clean and smelled good. The shower I LOVED and the full body mirror I couldn't stay out of. The staff was very nice and friendly. The hotel was quiet which I was hoping because I know they let animals stay there. Overall we really enjoyed our stay my boyfriend agreed this was one of the best hotels we ever stayed at.WOW!! We are delighted to hear that you enjoyed your stay and that we were able to provide a first in class experience for you both. We hope you'll be back soon,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations
0	Old and Tired. The hotel common areas look dated and worn. The room had an odor similar to old, rancid grease, especially in the kitchen. Some of the electrical outlets in the room did not work. There is no accomodation for a wheelchair to enter thru the front door. Not sure how they have avoided making the hotel wheelchair friendly. On a positive note, the bed was comfortable and the bedding was cozy.
0	expensive and full of roaches. They were very friendly when I booked my 246.00 with tax a night kitchenette room for that price you would expect a nice room. NOT!!! Room was very run down and walked into the bathroom and see roaches, totally grossed us out. I should have looked at other reviews before I took the room to see other people complaining about...

0	Holiday Inn Express New York City Times Square. The efforts of some of the staff were good - but they lack enough power to persuade me to return and thus why it received a poor instead of a terribleThe Staff:Hunter the manager - was great (sadly we had to get to know him through complaints) - a true professional, and provided exactly what I expected from a hotel manager.The maintenance guys(he had brades) - an honest, down to earth person - good service.The breakfast - is good and better than what I expected and was happy about thatThe breakfast staff was friendly and no complaints.The front desk staff the very happy guy at the front desk was the saviour of the reception staff the rest were less than impressive.The cleaning staff is as rude as you can get - especially the ones that dont speak English - they have very aggressive tones, the ones that can speak English are very argumentative.The Location: The location of the hotel was good - since this was my first trip to NYC its hard to be definite on this - the one thing that is awesome, is that its around the corner from a dollar pizza shop ( the exit of the hotel, turn right and then right again at the lights and its on the next corner - go past the dry cleaning shop)The Rooms:Room 1:Blood drops on the floor that had been dripped from the bed to the bathroom.Room 1 and Room 2 - had 2 double beds - ledge walking is the preferred method of movement because the rooms are that small.Room 2 bath sink hole was so clogged with hair and no-one had cleaned it and the poor maintenance guy had to clean it with pliers and plungers.I can honestly say, the elevator is half the size of the bedroom.
1	Biz in Florida. Quick stop in Orlando, on my way home. Hotel was great , clean and convenient to the airport. I have stayed here before and have never been disappointed.

0	Close to Mall but old and noisy. i stayed at room 239, to be honest it was very disappointing experience.. Breakfast is Ok.. but bed... noisy bathroom.. all were poor.
0	July 4th weekend. We stayed in a King Suite for 4 nights over the July 4th weekend. I can hardly express how good and positive our stay was. Breakfast was very good. The staff was always attentive and kind and helpful. We had difficulty with a flat screen in the bedroom and as we were stepping out for a few hours on Sunday,... More
1	Fantastic Staff. We booked 1 nite expressly to see the Musical showing directly across the street from the Diva. What a wonderful surprise to find the Diva exceeded our expectations. Fantastic Staff was always sincere in making our stay very comfortable. Extremely informative staff, especially Christian (Concierge) who was tremendously helpful. The King bed very comfortable and pillows were down filled, which provided a great nights sleep. (we did have an inside room) We are already recommending this hotel to our friends. Thank you again Diva staff for a wonderful stay.Dear Autumn A,Thank you for staying at Hotel Diva. I'm glad you had wonderful time while staying with us. I hope you had the chance to enjoy the complimentary amenities we offer: WIFI, business center, fitness center, tea lounge, perrier water service and sake hour in the lobby. On behalf of the entire Hotel Diva team, thank you for sharing your kind comments with Trip Addvisor. We look forward to seeing you again soon!Best regards,Virgil LopezHotel Manager
0	Lower than my originally low expectations. I should've believed what I read here about the spire elite benefits in this hotel. Basically nothing! Got no upgrade on the room. Dated decor inside the hotel compared to any Intercontinental hotels I have ever been to. So disappointed of the customer service (lobby) and quality of the room (which looks like it is from the Inn. Location is... More
1	Close to many attractions. We chose this accommodation due to its proximity to several sites. Museum of modern art is 1 minute walk, Space needle 1 minute walk and the monorail is a 1 minute walk.There is also a collection of restaurants and shops an easy 2 minute walk from the HotelWe checked in late, about midnight with friendly and efficient staff.The room has a queen bed with separate kitchen, bathroom and lounge room and is very comfortable.The Hotel has free tea and coffee in the foyer and a happy hour between 4.00pm and 7.00pm every night with US3.00 pints.Breakfast is sufficient with both hot and cold selections buffet style.The free shuttle to a radius of a kilometre was enough to get to Pikes market which was good. When you are ready to return just call and they will collect you from one of the designated pickup pointsI would return to this Hotel if ever back in Seattle
1	Nice Clean Place to Stay Near Orlando Airport. Wanted to stay in a hotel close to the airport, so picked the Hilton Garden Inn. The staff is very professional and friendly. This hotel is kept clean, which is always something I look for when traveling. My bed was very comfortable. Having a good TV with multiple channels was a bonus. The business center is a little small (2 computers), but the equipment is up to date and in good condition. The breakfast is a buffet, which is pricey (12 something). They do offer a continental breakfast, but it is limited. Without a car, restaurant choices outside the Hilton Garden are somewhat limited. The hotel restaurant was pretty good, but they don't have capacity to handle large groups. A party of eleven people showed up before us, so we were told it would take 45 minutes before we could get served. We ate at another restaurant that night. In summary, nice staff and a clean room, but food choices kind of limited without a car.Dear guest M H:Your effort and time in sharing your comments surrounding your experiences during your last stay is most appreciated and something we take very seriously. Please accept my sincere apologies for any inconvenience you may have experienced during your visit.We are constantly monitoring the performance of our team member to make sure our valuable guests as yourself is welcome with an efficient and pleasant staff procedures that provides the accommodations and service you expect.

0	Not Worth It. We've stayed at this hotel before and it would seem it is under new management as the quality is not as good. In our room, the dresser drawers were either dirty or broken, the toiletries in the bathroom were inconsistent (there were several lotions but only one shampoo), and the breakfast wasn't very good. On both days, the sausage was... More
1	Good Hotel - Good Location. This hotel aptly named the Whitney Hotel as it was the location of the Whitney Bank.Several of the features of the bank era are there to be seen such as the strong room doors and related features.This hotel is in a very good location very close to local transportation - buses and streetcars.A short walk takes you to many places to eat, drink and shop.Less than ten minutes walk to Canal Street, Bourbon Street and Royal Street.Pleasant ambience, friendly staff and comfortable rooms. We had a noisy air con and after underlining our concerns were moved to another room and provided with free on the house breakfast.The hotel has partnership with some eating/licensed businesses plus a two for one offer for Mardi Gras World.Thank you for your recent stay at the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans! We're glad to hear you enjoyed your visit and look forward to hosting you again soon. Please don't hesitate to contact us directly for your next New Orleans get-a-way!Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
1	Perfect. This was one of those rare occasions were it was hard to fault this great Hotel for anything. From the moment our email correspondences began, Mark in Reservations was fantastic in helping and advising us to make the correct option. The room had all the requirements that we needed.. Decent bathroom size with good shower pressure, Comfy and well sized bed and well appointed and spacious room. Its location is ideal, the staff are professional and the pricing is great.I would wholeheartedly recommend this to all visiting SF. It made our 20th wedding anniversary even more special.Hi BozzaM,What a great review! I am so happy that you were thrilled with your stay at Hotel Nikko, from the helpful assistance from our reservations team to your comfortable room. We wish you a very, very happy 20th wedding anniversary!Please let us know the next time you plan to visit San Francisco- we would be delighted to host you again!Cheers,Danielle Ortega Marketing Manager415-394-1175dortegahotelnikkosf.com
0	Called to Cancel. I called to cancel my reservation because I booked in the wrong place. The guy did not understand what I was saying then responded with we charge already before he rudely hung up on me. I needed to book in Thomson Ga and not Thomaston.Sir Sorry You late call and we busy all most full and I hold room. Thanks Sam
0	Fine for one night. Booked this hotel for the price. Amazing price, great location but.....you get what you paid for. One of the beds were broken, the room smelled like bug spray (I guess at least they spray), no hot water in the shower, the property looks like a prison, carpet was at least 400yrs old. But, location is 1mi from universal and will serve its purpose for one night at that great price.
1	Excellent stay at the top of the French Quarter. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful from the moment we walked through the front doors. We stayed for 4 nights, and couldn't have asked for a better location. The hotel is at the top of the quarter across from Armstrong Park... just five short blocks walk from Bourbon Street. Quick taxi/Uber service from hotel to anywhere you want to go. Breakfast was hot, and plentiful. Staff kept tables cleaned quickly for more guests to dine. Rooms were clean and big enough for three adults to not feel cramped at all. Bartender Ty was fun and made one heck of a Bloody Mary... and we will remember his meat pie next time we visit! Darlene at the front desk was an amazing help to us several times throughout our stay. The courtyard was a nice place to sit and relax and take a dip when it was super hot in the afternoon. Overall, I'd choose this hotel over and over again! Thanks BW for a great stay!Thank you for your review. We are extremely happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us. We take great pride in providing excellent customer service to all of our guests.We look forward to seeing you again on your next trip to New Orleans.Robert K., Manager on Duty
0	The room had no coffee maker in it. I went to the front.... The room had no coffee maker in it. I went to the front desk and told them. They said they would have one brought to me. Half an hour later i called the front desk and the phone rung for about 20 or more times until someone decided to pick up. Then i had to explain that i had went to the office and no one had came to the room and brought the coffee maker to me yet and finally after another 5-10 mins of waiting they came and gave it to me. It was not a good experience at all. The only reason i got the room was becasue i had to be at the airport early in the morning, mind you that i did not get there to check in until 930pm.
0	Noisey and not so nice smelling!. The staff was great, the rooms nice looking, but unfortunately the entire hotel has a foul odor. It was also very noisy on the back of the building with garbage pick up and bottles clanging til the wee hours!Thank you for sharing your stay with us. We are sorry to hear your visit was less than excellent and we will review this with our team. We are pleased that you found our staff to be great and will praise them for the efforts. Thanks again.
0	In no condition to accept guests!. This place was horrible! They are being completely remodeled so there hasn't been any general maintanance for awhile you can tell. Also, none of the staff we encountered should even be working in the hotel/service industry, no clue about their job. No pool, only a couple floors even have rentable rooms, poor selection for breakfast, all starchy items not even any fruit, and no internet in the so called business center! They could at least have put a sign on the door. We were going to do our air check-in one morning and couldn't, if we had known the night before we could have planned something else. Really awful. We had several other family members there as well. Hotels.com shouldn't even have them on their list. The photos do not portray what it is now. Bottom line-DO NOT STAY HERE!
1	Awesome Hotel fabulous staff. This place was a breath of fresh air. After traveling for 6 weeks we needed a hotel that could offer laundry facilities, fridge, coffee making, breakfast etc... it has it all. The reception and housekeeping staff were all very friendly, even had fresh coffee and crisp red apples at reception. Frederick at front desk was happy to recommend local restaurants and attractions. Although the rooms are a bit dated it had a great comfy bed and a separate lounge. The daily breakfast was fabulous. It even had a hot dish to offer each day. I would highly recommend this hotel to any couple wanting a value for money stay. Dear guest,Thank you very much for giving us the opportunity to serve you. We thank you for all your wonderful comments and look forward to seeing you again soon.Kind regards,
1	Shop, shows and everything Chicago, the allegro hotel. I can't say enough about this boutique hotel in the center of all the action. This hotel has been recently updated and it's even cleaner, prettier, and friendlier than it was. Everyone has a smile and is always trying to make your stay perfect. They upgraded us because they knew it was our 40th anniversary. Cassie at the front desk remembered us each day when we entered the lobby. People of all sorts , with pets, with kids, same sex couples, young and old. I love the wonderful mix of incredible people. This is how Chicago should be seen. And you are only steps from the best shopping in town on state street and the best theater in the Midwest. You will feel safe and comfortable and you will return....
1	Good location - friendly staff - loved it!. We came off a week long cruise on a Friday morning and arrived at 9:30am expecting to have to check our luggage. Surprise - the gentleman at the front desk moved rooms around and checked us in! We were staying on my husband's business points for 4 days. Hyatt knows how to treat it's points customers right unlike that other big H chain where we find ourselves in the worst rooms they have. This was an 18th floor room with a view towards the space needle. We had a room with 2 full beds but it worked as our 21 year old daughter was with us. We did place a towel in front of the door one night as some hallway noise was coming under the door but it seemed to be related to all the Baseball Fans staying at the hotel and arriving back at once.The bathroom had great amenities, a soaking tub and a spotless glass shower. The safe in the closet accomodated the laptop computer and we had plenty of hangers. The dresser was a little small since it accomodates the mini-bar. Right after check in someone knocked and asked if we had everythng we needed and she was very friendly.The doormen were knowledgeable and gave us good directions and information on the area. The Starbucks just outside the lobby was slow as molasses but friendly just not efficient! The Grayline bus to the airport leaves at 15 to and 15 after the hour from the west side of the hotel. This was a very good location as we went to ACT theater one night, walked over and back to Pikes Place Market another and to the Seattle Art Museum. Several malls are also close by with Food Courts.
1	We Love this beach front Inn. We have been coming to the Ocean Park Inn for years. We usually book several rooms for our extended family and friends. The is right for our budget and you dont have to leave the hotel to get breakfast in the morning they have a self serve cafe in house. The staff has always been great no complaints....Thank you for the kind review! We're glad you've become such loyal guests of ours! If you're not already, I would highly recommend signing up for our newsletter for special past guest promotions for next time! We look forward to seeing you again.
0	Ramada BWI. No Tissue box in the room or washroom. Room quality was poor. Cracks in the wall in washroom. Internet was pathetically slow, almost unusable, even late at night, very early in the morning. Would not stay here again.
1	Off of freeway close to city center, easy to find. Frankly, don't know where to begin. We were greeted with a smile. The hotel was spotless and so was our room. We didn't expect to have a kitchenette, but we did. Lighting was wonderful(plenty of lamps), plenty of pillows, (not just two), surprisingly the room had an alarm clock with a night light that stayed on which made it easy to get up during the nite and not stumble. Excellent TV picture. There was only one minor thing and this was the shower drain was not draining well, but the people before us may have not reported it. So I told the front desk about the drain. We would definitely stay there again. BTW, coffee is excellent, strong and bold. Good ol' Texas!I want to thank you for taking the time to post a review of your stay. We appreciate you letting us know about the issue with your bathtub. We are sorry for this issue, but are happy to read that we provided you with facilities and service that exceeded your expectations. We are pleased to hear that you found our hotel to be clean and that the full kitchen was a convenience. The staff and I would like to thank you again for posting your review. We look forward to welcoming you back in the future!
1	diamond in the rough. This little hotel was a fabulous find. nestled in between towering high rises this cute hotel offered a beautiful scape of suculants and palms customary to the area. A lush oasis in the concrete jungle with a gazebo on top to catch the color change of the sunrise (too bad there's a McDonalds sign there) Very clean, well managed with a good breakfast. A bit of a walk through the vagrant village to get to the Gas Lamp District though.Dear Patricia D, Thank you for taking the time to share your recent experience. I am pleased to know that you enjoyed your stay at our property and we are looking forward to have you as our guest in the future.Y ChenGeneral Manager
0	Would not recommend. This hotel was dirty, and it was a MOTEL, not a hotel as described. We tried to cancel after checking in, we were booked for a four night stay (through Expedia) but could only get half our money back. I'm surprised Ramada would put their name on this hotel at all. Staff was not professional (wore sweatpants), and there is... More
0	Not Impressed - I Killed A Scorpion in my Room. I stayed at the St. George the very first time I visited the city in November 2015. The rooms seemed nice enough, but it was Thanksgiving week and there were few patrons staying so the place seemed too quite. The breakfast was all carbs and sweets, a continental breakfast with just a couple of upgrades, such as biscuits and gravy... More
0	Spend the extra cash and go else where.. Although the view was very nice, the efficiency room facing the cove left a lot to be desired. There were only 3 forks and one butter knife in the drawer, nothing sharp enough for a grilled steak so that plan was scrapped. The room was miniscule and not very clean. There was mold on the inside of the fridge along... More
0	Old and run down!. Stayed here for 1 night. Friendly check in staff but the hotel needs and overhaul. Hallways are shabby and the room had a damp smell. The photos are misleading. If i was staying longer I would have most likely checked out early and moved elsewhere. The view over the busy main road was the high point with a lovely outlook... More
0	Poor Service. Hotel room is clean but really poor service. Called down to front desk for extra pillows and was told they didn't have any. For over 200 a night for a truck stop hotel off the highway you would assume they can provide you an extra pillow. After my 3rd call they said they found an extra pillow and I had... More
1	Good Things in Small Packages !. We found Hotel Diva after searching in the Downtown/Union Square area for a place to stay while visiting our Son and Daughter for the Holidays. We are familiar with this area and kept whittling down the options until we couldn't find a better place. The photos on their website made the rooms look smaller than they actually are. They are designed well and the beds are very comfy. The bath fixtures are pretty cool and the sink is the deepest we've seen in any hotel. The hotel is two blocks from Powell St which is where you can catch the Cable Car to Chinatown and Fisherman's Wharf. Union Square is full of shopping and eating opportunities. A few blocks over and you have Market Street and more shopping. The Ferry Building is withing walking distance as is SOMA, the Financial District and Chinatown. The hotel staff were all very considerate and friendly. The Fitness Center was the best equipped in the 20 hotels I stayed in this year. The Mexican Restaurant next door had killer Margaritas and Starbucks on the other side was convenient. There were only two things we would suggest - 1) have both elevators working and 2) it would have been nice to have the sink in the bathroom. Not big problems and having one elevator gave us the opportunity to use the stairs. After walking in SF, six flights of stairs ain't nothin'! You will like this place !Dear Menasha,Thank you so much for taking the time to share your Hotel Diva experience with other travelers. We are glad to hear it was a great stay! We'll be sure to tell Colibri how much you enjoyed their margaritas. We hope to see you on your next trip to San Francisco!Megan BrandtGuest Relations
1	Far From Strip but Nice. I stayed with my sister in this hotel...Basically, as it was New Years, various other hotels closer to the the Strip were booked. The SunCoast staff were very helpful friendly, even when our flight was delayed and we had to reschedule our shuttle pick-up from the airport---use this! The SunCoast is very far from the airport and it is free so you will save yourself money.The rooms and bathrooms were very clean and spacious. The buffet downstairs was decent. The only downside is, again, its distance from the Strip. The shuttle times are not very convenient, especially if you want to spend a night on the town. The cab fare from the Strip to our hotel costs us around 30. So, keep that in mind.Hope this helps!
1	Excellent location!. Great location! A short walk to everything in Old Town! Lots of restaurants and shops very close by. Room was clean, but basic--2 tea bags in room! Check-in and check-out was quick and easy!Beds were clean and comfortable. I was disappointed for the price paid that there was no breakfast included, and when we happened to eat breakfast at the restaurant there is was less than adequate. Our breakfast order, which we put out on our door, was not picked up at night so we had the surprise of no breakfast in the room the next morning, but the clerk in reception comped our meal as a result, which was the right thing to do.Thank you for sharing your experiences while with us. Your feedback regarding the mistake we made on your breakfast order is invaluable. I am thankful our leadership team did the right thing, and comped your meal. Based on your overall happiness with your stay, we hope you will give us a chance to welcome you back. If you have any questions regarding breakfast options, feel free to call us before you make your reservation. Thank you again!
0	Nothing fancy, but satisfactory.. Stayed here on business. Don't let the outside fool you, the room was nice and clean. The outside is not a good first impression. Everything here is very basic, nothing fancy. The outside definitely needs help. The staff was very nice and accommodating.
0	Rather eat elsewhere. We had a reservation for many people and were placed in the middle of the restaurant next to the bar, which made it tough to have conversations within our group. The food seemed over priced in my opinion. My wife and I both had tri tip steak and mine came out over cooked and the wife's steak was half over... More

In room tv very very old,wifi did not work normally,no coffee maker,no hair dryer and everything old old old.Location okay and very affordable ,the couple owner in their 70 are nice and friendly but they really need to improve to preserve business not just keep as it is.(credit card still needs to imprint by hand,you do not see it often...

1	Great hotel with great staff. Hilton Garden Inn in Olando has a great staff. Their restaurant is accomodating. The chef and the bartender are very friendly. All the Hilton Garden Inn's have always been a great experience for me. The front desk staff are always helpful and inviting. They greet you and know your status. This hotel also had rooms with jaccuzzi tubs.Dear Guest Juan E, I would like to thank you on behalf of my team at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport for your kind comments on our performance and your experience on your stay. Your comments have been communicated to all our associates and posted in our bulletin board.

Sincerely,Alex BlancoGeneral Manager
1	By far the best Marriott in Center City. In January I stayed in the Marriott Residence Inn and the Philadelphia Marriott Downtown and did not have a very positive experience. This time I decided to mix it up and stay in the Courtyard Philadelphia Downtown, and it is by far the best of the three hotels. The rooms were comparatively nicer, quieter, and overall more comfortable. The staff was also much more helpful. The next time I come back to Philadelphia, I will definitely stay in the Courtyard Philadelphia Downtown!Dear Rebecca K,We appreciate your loyalty towards our brand. We are glad your stay at the Courtyard Philadelphia Downtown was amazing and that you and your family loved your comfortable room and our staffs exceptional service. Thanks for your terrific feedback, and we are pleased to know that we will be your familys preferred choice for all your future visits to Philadelphia.Thank you, David Kidd Assistant General Manager
0	The room was not clean and smelled of smoke. We did not.... The room was not clean and smelled of smoke. We did not stay and they would not refund us as we were told that we paid online and could not be refunded.
1	So Easy. The Hacienda is truly in Old Town, San Diego. We could walk to numerous restaurants, the transit plaza, and see how things were done long ago. However, the hotel is very modern with a great heated pool, free breakfast with many choices, and beautiful courtyards with gorgeous flowers. The rooms are large and very comfortable, and the price is right. A perfect choice for visiting San Diego This is exactly the kind of experience we strive for - effortless comfort. Its nice to stroll through Old Town! Thank you for taking time to share you experience. Also, pleased to hear you enjoyed our heated pool, flowering landscape and relaxing courtyards. We look forward to welcoming you again! Regards,Ryan AguinaldoGeneral Manager
1	Don't judge a book....... Stayed two nights over parents weekend in October. The bleak exterior and entrance was a little off-putting, so we were pleasantly surprised by the size and condition of the room. The heat wasn't working, so it was pretty cold, but it was obvious they were doing their best to fix it so we toughed it out the first night. They supplied a space heater the next morning, but then moved us to another room (just as clean and comfortable) the second night. The hotel was full but we never heard our neighbors. Bathroom and breakfast were basic. Staff was friendly. Odd-numbered rooms face rear/away from street and parking lot. Recommended for quick stay.
0	Horrible. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE
1	Great for solo business person in the Loop. Stayed here 10/22-10/27/2017. I live in Chicago's north suburbs and had to be downtown early for long days working. Stayed here to avoid the commute. Worked out really well. The rooms are small but excellent for a solo business person. The location is excellent for business in the Loop. Price is excellent too.Hello Jim N,Thank you for staying with us at Chicago River Hotel during your recent visit from the suburbs. We are glad to hear our location and the price point made your long work week easier than having to commute so far each day. Hopefully we will get the opportunity to serve you again in the future!
1	park fly. We booked this hotel as we are Marriott Rewards guests needed 9 nights of parking while down in the carribean. Our son daughter in law met us at the airport, so shared the room. We had a nice dinner drinks in the restaurant before retiring for the night. Our flight was at 5:30am, so made arrangements for the shuttle at 4am, which worked out well! Upon returning we did have difficulty with our parking ticket getting out of the parking lot...Parking is not in a covered, so had to clear our car of a little snow. Overall, a very nice experience!Dear Karen B - Thank you for being a loyal Chicago Marriott O'Hare guest. I am happy to hear that you enjoyed your most recent stay with us. We look forward to welcoming you back in the future. Safe travels.
1	Excellent hotel. My three night stay was absolutely perfect. The check in process was so easy it seriously took 3 min . The girl that helped me checking in was so friendly and welcoming . I had a long flight and horrible cab ride and this young woman was so refreshing. My room was clean , modern and quiet. The room had a keurig coffee machine which was nice . They have free cold filtered water and bottles on ever floor. My room view was outstanding. Convenient location to all the downtown tourist spots. I will absolutely stay here again because the hotel was nice but Honestly the staff was incredible . Hello katfrog45,We are delighted to hear you enjoyed your stay with us and found the staff to be friendly and welcoming. We are very lucky to be in a great location as you pointed out but we really pride ourselves on our service. Thanks for taking the time to write a review about your experience and we look forward to seeing you next time in town!
1	Wonderful Hotel. I was a little worried by some of the reviews I read that stated the staff was rude and the hotel was in disrepair but the price was amazing so we went ahead and booked....and I'm SO GLAD WE DID!! The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful (and I'm from the South, so I know friendly.) The hotel has normal wear and tear, but was very clean and nicely furnished. Some people may not like that the microwave and fridge are extra (would have been nice to have but we wouldn't have used either so it didn't bother us). Beds are very comfortable and rooms are large enough to lounge in the evenings after a long day. The free shuttle service was great. The Metro (subway) is farther away than listed. The site stated 1/4 mi, but it's closer to 3/4 or 1mi. We had no problem walking it during the day. If this is your first visit, be sure to ask specifically where the shuttle will pick up. We were on the wrong side and missed it the first time. If you exit the Metro up the escalators, go out and to the left up the steps to where there are several bus stops. If you exit to the right near the greyhound stop (and a several story parking garage), you're on the wrong side. The shuttle drivers were very nice and happy to give directions and tips. Once you're on the Metro, a 20min ride gets you into the city. Definitely worth it to save hundreds on a hotel room. There are several restaurants right outside the hotel and several more within 1/4-1/2mi walk. There are also some smaller shopping places if you forget any necessities. We would definitely recommend this hotel and will definitely return if we're ever back in the DC area.
0	Do not stay here. We stayed a half hour and left all I can say is gross and LOUD..... The guest that were there looked as though they lived there the room next to us had a plant hanging up in the window. The sink and toilet were green enameled. The bed had hair all threw it. The floors were not vaccumed and visibly... More
0	Lackluster Employees. I'd like to start on a positive. The location was great! 3 blocks from Bourbon St. and less than a 2 mile walk from the downtown area with shopping and museums. All but one of the employees I encountered were not out right rude. They just didn't care and you could tell they didn't want to be there. When I asked a question about late check out no one was able to give me a straight answer. Would not stay here again.
1	A secluded La Jolla Get-a-way. We were looking for a secluded resort style hotel to relax and enjoy the La Jolla area and were not dissapointed. We (family of 4 adults) did not want to stay at one of the chains and had stayed on Coronado island and the Lodge at Torrey Pines before so we gave Estancia a try and were very satisfied. The staff was nice and very helpful with beautiful landscaping and vegetation, even in the middle of a severe drought. There were 2 walking paths from the hotel with one going to the glider port/beach which was cool watching the para gliders launch and sail along the cliff (both para and hang gliders available for tandem rides) and the other path going through a nice neighborhood to Black's beach which had a fairly steep road at the end which got your heart going on the way back. The girls had no trouble finding chairs at the pool and raved about the Spa's Hanakasumi and Inspire 80 minute massages. I would head to the fitness center in the afternoon while they were out sunning and was the only one in there (although I heard that the mornings usually had a crowd). There are 4 treadmills, 2 bikes, 2 ellipticals with free weights to 45 lbs and 4 machines ie enough for a basic workout. We did the kayaking/snorkeling tour from La Jolla Kayak with the kayaking being the better activity (although having a sea lion swim by while snorkelling in one of the caves was pretty cool). We usually ordered in breakfast which was good with ample portions. The best breakfast though was at The Cottage, a must if you enjoy breakfast. We went the good but casual restaurant route with George's at the Cove terrace and the Brockton Villa (stay inside to avoid sea lion aroma) for good food with a view and Piazza 1909 for a step above the pecan crusted/fish taco fare. All were topped off with gelato from Bobboi's. We were there for 4 nights during the week and all were able to truly unwind and relax. The only nit I had was that the housekeeping staff never understood that we had 4 adults so daily calls for more coffee cups etc was needed but overall, we would definitely stay again.Dear Mathonthego.Thank you for taking the time to write this review of your stay. We are pleased to hear that you had such a wonderful stay with us and you were able to take advantage of the amenities we offer. It sounds like you were very active during your 4-day stay, and we look forward to welcoming you back again, soon!
1	We Play Naughty and Sleep Saintly alright!!. Great place to hang and rest after doing the Key West thing. The staff was very attentive and courteous. The decor is gorgeous! Attention to detail from the lobby to the room's bathroom. The pool area is an oasis to cool your body and enhance your soul. We plan to make this our place to stay whenever we're in Key West and can't wait to check out the one in New Orleans. GreatHotelsThank You for taking time out to give our property such a wonderful review. We are so tickle our property has made such an impression. We also appreciate any loyalty or interest you may have in our sister property which like Key West is an amazing property. Please contact us to assist in any future reservations or information you may need.
1	Top Notch + Great Place to Lay Your Head. As with any St. Regis, the level of service here is incredible. I had to stay for a few days for business earlier in the year and with a tight schedule, the hotel and comfort level of sleeping was really important to me.Rooms are very well designed. Bed is very comfortable. Staff attends to every and any need that you might have. I can't say enough good things about their attention to detail and customer service.Dear OnlySane,Thank you so much for taking the time to review your most recent stay at the St. Regis San Francisco. We are delighted to hear that you enjoyed your stay, and enjoyed a restful night's sleep! We look forward to welcoming you back soon to San Francisco's 'Best Address'!Warm Regards,Andre BroseHotel Manager
0	Will never stay here again. Service was terrible, could not get any one on the phone to ask questions, there was only one GSR in the lobby. the breakfast was cold, room was dirty, floor never vacuumed, only one bar of soap, only one set of towels of each size
0	I wish I could give this hotel anegative score. Our first room had an interior door that led to the adjacent room and the lock was broken. So, we asked for another room. The next room smelled like someone had burnt a pack of cigarettes as incense in the room. We booked a non-smoking room. At that point we were just glad to have a room where all the doors locked. I would not stay here again
0	Gross and smelly. Needs new cleaning staff.. Sure - its a boutique hotel with a great location and offers complimentary breakfast. But Ive never encountered issues like this before in all my extensive travels. My check-in and check-out each took over 10 minutes, blaming slow computer issues while I watched guests being served faster at the adjacent desk. At check out, the front desk couldnt even print my folio so I could review and approve the charges. The hotel is made of two buildings if youre in the second building its just across a small patio. However this patio is used as the hotels staging area for extra linens and especially the dumpsters. So every time we needed to reach our room, we had to walk through horrific trash odors. On this trip, I booked two rooms. Upon arrival, The first rooms toilet wouldnt flush which means 1) it didnt flush for the cleaning crew and 2) the cleaning crew did noting to report and repair. When we came back to the room after the repair, toilet water was everywhere all over the floor and the maintenance guy used one of our towels to drag around the floor and left it in the bathroom. GROSS. In the second room, on our first night I pulled down the bedsheets and was appalled to find a lot of food crumbs and hair from the prior occupants. It was quite evident. GROSS. When I called the front desk, the staff informed me that no one else was available to change our bedding. She had a formal response but I could tell shes just going through the motions. So I asked for new sheets to change it myself. I do commend the hotel manager for calling me back the next morning, sounding genuinely concerned, and offering other incentives to rectify the cleanliness issue. But at this point, the hotel staff doesnt reflect the same professionalism or attitude, and I know we wont be returning here.Thank you for your feedback. On behalf of our hotel, please accept my apologies for failing to exceed your expectations regarding the check-in and out process, poor service, and lack of cleanliness. These are things we must work on to ensure we continue to provide an exceptional stay experience for each guest. We appreciate the honest feedback and hope you will give us another chance to exceed your expectations on a future visit.
1	Modern and funky. We stayed here for 3 nights as part of a road trip! The reception staff were lovely and polite on check in! The rooms were comfortable, clean and very funky! The bathroom was amazing! However the toiletries were not replaced when the room was serviced daily. The walls were quite thin and we could hear the guy in the room next door! It wasnt horrendous and it didnt disturb us. It seemed to be very stylish but some of the finer points were missed. The upstairs bar was recommended to us on check in so we tried it out. We were really disappointed with the bar, it was a Monday night, and it was not busy. The staff seemed uninterested in us, we sat down and my dad went to the bar to ask a couple of questions, he was stood there for nearly 10 minutes, we decided to leave when eventually a member of staff spoke with him so we decided to stay. The first drink I wanted was a southern comfort, but they had none. Next I wanted a Gin and tonic but they had no tonic. In the end I had a cider which wasnt very nice. The bar staff continued to seem disinterested in us and we felt like a burden to them. It was nice sitting on the roof top and having a drink but that was the only bit of the experience we enjoyed. We did not use their car park because it was expensive, but it was in a good location for other car parks. We did not want to be in the middle of the French quarter and found that we enjoyed the 20 minute walk to get there from the hotel! It is in a good location for lots of breakfast stops as well. Hello Leah,Thank you for your stay with us. We are pleased to hear that your check in experience went well but we are sorry to hear there were some issues with housekeeping and the service you received at our roof top bar. These issues have been addressed with the team so that we may improve on this. We hope you will give us a chance to win you back as a guest.
0	DO NOT STAY HERE. I'll start off by letting you all know that when travelling in the UK we usually stay in cheap hotels (Travelodge, Premier Inn etc) but this hotel is the pits. It wasn't all bad, so there are some small Pros. Pros:20 mins walk to UniversalOver the road from Wet n WildVery cheapWalgreens just over the road, as is a KFCDairy Queen around the corner for yummy foodComfy beds (really comfy)Free WiFi in lobbyCons:Not particularly helpful staffNoise constantly all through the night from iFLYTheft - we stayed in two rooms and something went missing from both of them (staff didn't seem to care, we got one item back from a cleaner after bringing the Police in)Decor - paint and plaster peeling from wallsCleanliness - floors and bathroom wasn't cleaned every day (although fresh towels were available every day and beds were made daily)Noisy hotel - constant noise from other guestsSummary:So in summary, the thefts from maids is enough for me to recommend you don't stay here (we even know the maid was still kept on even after admitting taking the item!!!!).Its in a good location but other better hotels are also in this area, so book those first.
0	Poor management. We visited this hotel after booking online for a short weekend visit. The hotel is quite lovely and our room was very clean and cozy. We got a petite room and it was fine for the two of us as we don't require a lot of space. The entire hotel was very clean and the pool and lobby were beautiful. Our check in was fine and we valeted our car for the night. The next morning we called down 20 minutes early as instructed for the retrieval of our car. After 45 minutes of waiting we inquired at the desk to find out what the issue was. We were told they were on it and it would be soon. At that point, we realized the six other ppl standing around were also waiting for cars. They had one valet and he brought 2 cars that no one needed while we were all waiting. Two hours went by and the lobby became packed. Two bellhops were sitting in chairs not doing a thing. At one point, the one was sitting in a guest chair while guests were standing and he began to sleep. We inquired a second time and told the same thing with no apologies at any point. It turned out to be an over two hour wait for a car that was parked in a lot behind the hotel. We even asked for our keys so that we could get it ourselves and they told us the valet had the keys and this wasn't possible. After that we decided to park our own car and not use their valet. We told the front desk and she said that was fine and she removed the charge for our earlier inconvenience. We parked in the same lot and saved 4 by doing so. The night before check out, we asked if we could go ahead and checkout then since our flight was at 4am the next day. She told us no and their would be someone on staff at our departure time to take care of it. Frustrating, but we figured it was policy.The next morning, we got to the desk and the check out clerk told us that all computers were down and there was nothing she could do.Arriving at the airport, we received our final invoice and noticed that they not only charged us for the valet service that they said they removed, they charged us for every night that we self parked. We called and told there was nothing that they could do at that time because the person who removed the valet charge was on vacation and no manager was on duty. Also, we were disconnected during this conversation and had to call back several times because the phone was ringing busy after our disconnection. Four hours later, we were sent a corrected bill via email. No call, no apology, no customer service skills what so over. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone unless they would like to be treated like their business does not matter. Thank you for choosing the French Market Inn for your New Orleans stay and taking the time to share your experience. Your kind comments about our historic hotel are appreciated. We typically receive high marks for our customer service - apologize we missed the mark during your stay. We are sorry for the difficulties you experienced with our valet service. Please know all of your comments have been passed on to management. We hope you enjoyed your time in The Quarter and hope for a future opportunity to restore your confidence in our services.
1	Great hotel. Clean rooms and very nice staff. Would stay here again. The pool was well kept and I appreciated that I had free wifi and was able to use the business centre including printing my boarding passes and they did not charge me for this service.Dear Guest Victoria E, I would like to thank you for sharing your experience at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport during your stay. Nowadays with so many choices in life specially when travelling with hotels, airlines, places, restaurants, etc one of the most rewarding aspects of our job is to know that we were able to make a difference and exceeded our guests expectations. Thank you for staying with us and we are looking forward to welcome you to once again provide you with an outstanding level of service and nothing less. Sincerely,Alex BlancoGeneral Manager

0	Road trip. Stay away. Booked with Hotwire as a 3 star hotel with a 95 approval rate. Hotwire should be ashamed. I wouldn't even give it a 1 star. I feel dirty just thinking about this place. Only stayed for one short night and left with the gift of Bug Bites all over my legs . Website pictures are quite deceiving. The... More
0	bed bug bites. Management has ceased to care. This hotel is run down and how dare them advertise it as a spa/resort. I could go on and on about all the negatives but the worst of the worse was waking up with over forty bed bug bites. Do not stay here. No management on duty to report this detrimental health issue.
0	"Maintenance Issues. Room 217. Shower flow rate was low - just a trickle. Hot water was luke-warm at best - no ""hot"" water. Shower drain was in the middle of a flat tiled shower floor sloping toward the back end of the shower where water puddled up and did not drain, leaving soap scum, etc. - very unsanitary. Bathroom sink did not drain well, leaving shaving cream, soap scum, whiskers in sink after shaving by the time it drained - and the drain had a ""sewer"" smell. There were unrepaired holes in the drywall at the bathroom door jamb. I put clothing into the dresser drawers and the drawers would not stay shut - annoying! Refrigerator made a loud humming noise - on and off about every 3-5 seconds. No continental breakfast included (unless you want to pay $9 to have it delivered to your room.) One evening, I decided to use the hot tub outside (because I was rather cold and knew I couldn't take a hot shower). The palm tree trimmers did not cover the hot tub that day, so they had dropped palm tree trimmings into the hot tub rendering it unusable. The pool cleaning company was there the next evening to clean it out."
1	Great hotel and service. Stayed here on business and staff went out of their way to be service oriented. Room was in nice shape and staff took pride in serving guests. Made use of car rental facility in the hotel which was far more convenient than renting at the airport. Will certainly be back when I am in the area. Thank you for your post. I am delighted you found the hotel comfortable and to learn that you found our staff to be service oriented. I hope that we exceeded your expectations. The rental car kiosk located in the hotel is indeed a nice convenience and I am happy you were able to utilize this to service. Hope to see you again soon.
1	Great family stay. In DC at the beginning of the Labor Day weekend, and we couldn't have picked a better place to stay. The service was fantastic from the moment we arrived by taxi, through check-in, and culminating in a turn-down service that was just the extra special treatment we loved. There were special weekend events like a family movie with tons of snacks, wine and cheese tasting in the lobby, even a magician for the kids. I loved it. The kids loved it. I would recommend highly and definitely stay again when in the DC area. The metro is right outside the front door!
0	Not Very Good. 3 nights of so so... Giant fans blowing in hallway all night.. Bland food... Smoke coming into the room from adjacent rooms... Closet sized bathroom... Very old motel somewhat spruced up... Should I go on I was disappointed in this hotel and would not stay here again.
1	awesome!. Loved this hotel, great view, great location, great pool. great staff. Next to tons of restaurants and a bike ride to the amusement park. Had a blast! The front desk even checked us in online for our flight! Also the free breakfast has lots of options. Would definately stay at this privately owned property again!Thanks for leaving such a nice review! We are happy to hear you enjoyed your stay and found our staff resourceful and helpful. We are happy to hear you enjoyed all of our amenities as well as all of the restaurants nearby. We hope to have you back soon! Thanks for staying at the Ocean Park Inn.
1	Scents Can Be Improved. The hotel is conveniently located a few blocks from Union Square and we like that the room has decent size as well. One thing to note, they charge 'mandatory' fee of 15/night and the reception told us that it covers Internet, concierge and others. Felt a bit disappointed that it is not included in the reservation fee and that it is 'mandatory'. The worst thing in our opinion of the hotel is the scent. The lift smells and hope that the management can do something about it. Other than the things we dislike above, the room has pretty good amenities and I personally love the shower gel they provided. However, the bathroom gets flooded very easily by the water that comes out from the shower head which easily spray beyond the tub. We think it's a pretty good hotel overall but will not come back unless the scents can be improved.Thank you for taking the time to share this feedback with us. We value all guest comments as it allows up the opportunity to improve. We will review this with our team and hope to have the chance to impress you on a future visit. Thanks again.

1	I love this hotel!!. This was my second stay in this hotel. The first was before Hurricane Katrina and the 2nd was after in 2010. We remembered having a very nice stay there before so decided to try this hotel again. The location is wonderful...right next to the trolley line (but not a noice issue...very quite). The price is very reasonable. We checked around...an excellent value in my opinion. We got a 2 room King Suite for the 3 of us. We loved everything about this room. The ceilings and windows are old-style tall...which just feels right in this city. There is lots of granite everywhere. The living room is a completely separate room so everyone had their privacy. The king bed was very comfortable. My 17 year old son said the fold out couch was pretty nice too....although he wouldn't want to share it with anyone...then again, he's 6'4 and about 210 lbs.! The breakfast was a very nice buffet, hot, and plentiful with real scrambled eggs, biscuits, bacon, fruit, juice...and the evening cocktails/soda and wings, chips, baked potatoes, hotdogs, veggies, dips, chicken fingers were plentiful and a great alternative to eating out again. We had a big lunch so just snack food was perfect allowing us time to enjoy the pool on the ROOF!! Parking is fenced, selfpark right next to the hotel for about 17. It is within easy walking distance of the famous Mother's...and all the traditional New Orleans favorites. When you consider the price of breakfast and the free alcoholic beverages and snacks...it is so worth the price....I think with parking included we paid about 150 tops. I am ready to go there again!
0	Incredibly Disappointing. Disappointing wouldnt begin to encompass our experience here last weekend. Perhaps it was due to the holiday weekend, but as SPG Gold members, we have never experienced service as blatantly rude as we did at this property. It was so unbelievable at times we thought we surely were the victims of an odd hidden camera show where at any point a host might pop out and say Just kidding! We just wanted to record your facial expressions while we lied to you, hung up on you, and generally treated loyal paying guests like dirt. First off, the good this hotel is in a great location if you want to be in the heart of the French Quarter. Youre in the middle of Bourbon Streets action and the hotel gives you easy access to many of the citys attractions. The staff who man the valet are friendly and awesome. The pillows are comfortable. Thats about the end of the positives. During our three night stay two couples, two rooms we experienced many negatives. In addition to just generally unkempt rooms (smelled like stale vomit when we walked in the door, showers dont drain, sticky surfaces) they were not cleaned until very late in the day. Even cleaned, dirty towels were left in the room, trash wasnt taken away, and little more done than smoothing out the duvet and tossing clean towels on the bathroom shelves. Wed been informed by Starwood that a junior suite was available and that we would have the option to upgrade on our second and third nights, however, the front desk denied having a suite available for us. We reconfirmed a suite was available with Starwood, and then were again lied to by the hotels front desk staff who told us they did not have a suite available for us. Each of these interactions were incredibly brusque and rude. Early Saturday morning, when my husband returned from an evening out with his brother, he called down to the front desk and asked if a bottle of water could be sent up to the room, as wed already used the single bottle of complimentary water provided much earlier during our stay. The front desk attendant told him no and that he could come back down to the front desk and BUY a bottle of water. He told her that in every other Starwood property weve stayed in, it hasnt been a problem to get an extra bottle of complimentary water and that hed be happy to come down to the desk to get it, but didnt want to buy one. She told him he could come down and buy a bottle of water, then hung up on him. It was raining on Sunday morning and at 8:30am we called the front desk to ask if the hotel had any umbrellas available for guests to borrow. We were told, No theyre already all out for the day. And again promptly hung up on. No alternate suggestions, no apologies. It doesnt take a genius to know there are not a lot of people staying on Bourbon Street up and roaming around at 8:30am on a Sunday morning. Fast forward to a couple of hours later when we returned to the hotel to prepare to check out and head home. We asked for a couple of trash bags to put our now soaking clothes in for the trip home. Fully expecting a No and hang up, we were shocked when they said theyd send some up. Guess we should have known better than to get our hopes up because the trash bags didnt show up until over half an hour later, as we were walking out the door, and had made due shifting our luggage around other ways and utilizing gifts bags from shopping. Couple all this with the hotel staff being generally unfriendly no returned smile or greeting when you enter the hotel, no effort to provide any degree of positive customer service or build rapport, no willingness to help ensure you actually enjoy your time at their property it was an incredibly disconcerting Starwood experience. If you just want a place to lay your head in between jaunts on Bourbon Street and service means nothing to you, this is your place. Otherwise, avoid at all costs.I am very sorry to hear of your experience during your stay with us. The comments you have noted are certainly disappointing to hear. We truly value our guests and strive to make sure that our guests have a positive experience during their time with us. We will certainly address your concerns with appropriate staff members. Feel free to contact me directly if you would like to discuss further. We truly appreciate your feedback. Thank you!
1	Scottsdale's excellent secret. I was not surprised by the excellent service and individual attention which was given to me other wedding guests that stayed at this lovely property. Marriott is know for its' excellent service and attention to detail regarding its guests. The accommodations are always immaculately maintained, the front desk staff is always willing to assist regarding any reasonable request. I am a travel concierge, because of their stalwart commitment to service, I will continue to recommend the Courtyard by Marriott to my clients. Lisa and Jean welcomed me and additional family members and ensured that we were well informed regarding shopping opportunities close by. We were availed of their free shuttle services within a 3 mile radius throughout our stay. Friends and family were all there to attend my daughter's wedding just a few miles away, their individual attention to each party member made my stay at Salt River especially exceptional. While the entire hotel staff was amazing, I can't begin to bestow the appropriate amount of gratitude and praise Lisa and Jean deserve for their unrivaled professionalism and basic kindness...Well Done!!!
1	Great Experience. The room was large with twin queen sized beds. The bathroom was the right size and we had planty of room for relaxing and dining. I have 2 small children and they were very comfortable. To keep them busy, I hooked up my media streamer to the LCD tv and away the kids went with their cartoons. The pool was a nice plus. While not too large, it was plenty for the people that partook. The kids made many friends while at the pool and we had several kids come to our room to invite my kids to come down to the pool. I can't say enough about the breakfast. The days we were at the hotel, the breakfast was amazing. Eggs, bacon, muffins, cereal, jucies, waffles, etc...just about everything that my kids love for breakfast. Different days had different breakfast specials. One day was breakfast sandwiches which were quite good. Another day was breakfast burritos which were also quite good, but there was no salsa. Luckily, we had salsa in the room. Overall, I was very pleased with our stay at this hotel.Thank you for taking time to share your great experience with our hotel. I am very happy to see that you enjoyed your stay here at the Best Western Mission Bay. Thank you for your compliments to our rooms and breakfast.When you return to San Diego, please feel free to contact me directly for your reservations needs.

1	Top Notch Start To Finish. Spent four nights at the Orchard Garden this week with my wife and daughter and can't say enough good things about the experience. From my initial phone call , a follow-up email and then one back from the hotel asking if we needed anything before arrival, it was the best dealings we have had with any hotel. They honored my request for extra towels and a high room away from elevators and ice machines. We overlooked Bush Street and heard very little noise and slept well on comfy beds. Hotel is well located, clean and does things right. Doormen, front desk staff and housekeeping were excellent. Our double superior room was bright, clean and larger than we expected. Do yourself a favor and consider the Orchard Garden in your travel plans to San Francisco. Don't know what previous reviews are complaining about concerning transportation from the airport. Our cab from SFO was 49.50 (before tip) and the hotel arranged a Lincoln town car for us back to the airport for 50 (before tip). Really can't beat that considering the cost of hotel parking in the city.Dear TwoRetiredOshawans,We are excited to read that you loved our hotel and found your accommodations pleasing for your stay. Our team always tries to meet the expectation of our guests. Whether it be simply more towels in the guest room or a quiet room away from the elevator we are here to make your stay the best stay possible.I really appreciate your comments about our beautiful hotel and we hope to see you back at the Orchard Garden Hotel in the near future.Thank you,Bruce PinckneyFront Office Manager
0	Ants. The staff was very friendly and nice, the bed was comfortable, but there were ants on the walls, in the bathroom - we kept our suitcases zipped to make sure we didn't take any with us! Fortunately the bed was clean and ant-free. The room was clean - they just had a problem with ants which should have been taken care of. The front desk guy, a very friendly young man, did tell s when we left that the were doing complete renovations in the next few months, so this problem might soon be solved.
0	Moved too many times. Ther were too many hassles during the check in process and rooms not being available multiple times. The travel party of eight with all of the Baggys have to be moved to three different locations not because of their request because it was thought to be available after all. It was a big castle after traveling for 14 hours. Greetings Theresa,When we spoke at check out, I thought we were able to make it right. Please email me at yoldeen.saintforthilton.com directly so I can understand the reason behind the 2 star review. I'm sure we will be able to resolve this.Assistant General ManagerHampton Inn Suites at SeaWorld Orlando
1	Good comfortable well serviced accommodation, close to the French Quarter. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel for four days during September 2012. A home away from home! Service and customer focused staff in all areas of the hotel looked after customers with genuine care. Every evening from 5.30pm they have the Manager's reception, which entails a free drink of your choice and extensive snacks. both hot and cold food. The breakfast is very adequate (cereals. eggs. waffles, juices, toast etc) .. and there are number of dishes. Perhaps some cut up fruit would have been good but there was bananas and apples available. There is coffee, juice, soda. Iced water available any time of the day in the reception area.The pool on the rooftop is excellent with strangely enough few guests using it....which suited us very well. always sparkling clean and fresh towels available. The small gym got a little hot and stuffy after 8am as the sun streamed in through a number of windows. We walked an easy walk to the riverfront where you can catch the street car. There usually is a street car operating outside the hotel but maintenance work was in progress when we stayed and only buses were available. The hotel has just commenced the building of a new wing and originally was due for completion in June 2013 but now completion is expected December 2013. We stayed in room 821 and had a small balcony overlooking the early stages of the construction sight. Didn't experience any inconvenience or noise. In fact had a lovely view at night as there was nothing obstructing our view, but this will change as the new hotel wing progresses. You will be fine for several months until this occurs. There is a small fridge and microwave in the cupboard which is adequate but go down to Frenchmen's Street for some great cafes and restaurants. Go to Coups Place for great Cajun food and cheap too! There is no doorman opening and closing doors. but who cares with all the other advantages one has in staying in this delightful hotel. So nice to know that management staff care about you and your stay at their hotel! Would recommend this hotel without any concern. When you book in 2013 to stay just first ask about the construction progress so you can enjoy your stay free of any inconvenience.
0	Most of the rooms smell !. Changed rooms, but it didn't help. Carpet soaked with chemicals... I left door open, but it didn't help. The smell stayed. 2.floor to the right is probably the worst. It seems to be a health risk. I received a light headache in the morning. I did not experience the praise about this hotel.

1	Great, The Second Time Around. My son and came to Atlanta for our annual trip to see the Braves. We stayed at the JW a few years ago. Although the hotel was nice, the experience was just ok. The room was nice but had the old style TV. Room service was slow, staff ok. The only thing that was great was being next door to the Lenox Mall. Last year we stayed at at the Omni but decided this year to give the JW another try. I'm so glad I did. It was a completly different experience from our previous stay. The staff was genuinely helpful and concerned. After checking in (10am) I left the front desk thinking I remembered where to go to get to the room. I saw a security person and asked her. She was so helpful. She went on the elevator with us, took us to our room,made sure our keys worked and if the room met our standards. I have never received service like this. The security person's name is Gwen Rankin. She gave us her card and told us if we need anything to contact her. The room was very nice and had the flat screen TV that we come to expect from a high class hotel. My son and I had plans the next day and wanted room service. We thought we had to get up at 6am to place our order so that could get to our destiation on time. Well we woke up late and was going to change our plans. I called room service and they told me they will be there in 30 mins or less. I was pleasantly surprised. Our previous experience with room service, it took them almost 2 hrs to bring our food. Needless to say my son and I were able to keep our plans. After this trip it was decided that if I'm able to get the great Government rate as I did this trip, the JW will be our hotel whenever we visit Atlanta.
0	Can be improved on. Dear Sir/Madam I arrived closer to 23h00 the first night. I was first assigned Room 421 which after spending some time there realised that the main lights were not working and the toilet appeared to be clogged - also found a sweetener paper wrap in the toilet. I was then assigned Room 418 - none of the lights in main area and then finally got Room 426 well past midnight. The lights kept having to be reset during the course of my stay. The general cleanliness of the rooms was not great.
0	Terrible dirty place. Good thing I brought my lysol spray with me. The carpet soo.. dirty and stained. I should know as soon as we entered the lobby! Traveling with two kids I cleaned with clorox towelettes everything in the room.
1	Huge room - great for the price, but noisy by the highway. I can't remember which Wingate we stayed at but we came through Florida toward Indy and it was right off that route. This hotel was clean, very friendly but extremely noisy at night. The highway traffic was really bad on a Thursday night during Spring Break. However the hotel room itself was wonderful! It had 2 separate bedrooms with tvs for each, a kitchen area and a computer area plus free breakfast for under 100. It didn't seem to be a crappy part of town either. Would recommend it but not on spring break. Starbucks is just 2 blocks down - bonus.
0	seven seas. dirty
0	Building should be torn down. There is nothing I can say about this place. Stuck here for a convention. Poor service, Poor food quality. Bathrooms are at least 15-20 years old. Water issues. Maid service not even close to daily. Entire property is dirty. I would not stay here again if it were free
1	Good for price. Great hotel for good price!hotel was clean.everyone was very friendly (huge plus!)breakfast was delicious .. so many choices... sausage gravy and biscuits, waffles, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, egg omletes, sausage patties.great location... 5 miles from UCF, right off hwy but very quiet hotel.this will definately be our hotel of choice for the next 4 years while our son attends UCF!Dear Shannon LThank you for staying at my Best Western Inn Suites here in Orlando. This is a great place to stay for any reason.Your comment on how we are a good match for families is certainly spot on. Our breakfast allows everyone in the family to choose what they like to eat and its included within your rate complimentary. I sincerely hope you can return on vacation soon and trust your business in Orlando went well
0	bad experience. clean room but not a good one...over the mechanical room and noisy.....broken shower head bracket which fell on my wife's foot....impossible to get breakfast in the morning with long line up and no food...no front desk support to solve problems
1	Almost perfect. We stayed at the Solamar as part of our honeymoon last week. We arrived after a long drive and straight away we were hit with 3 big charges. 45 a day to park your car there which seemed slightly excessive! And then one of my biggest gripes with hotels...12 for wifi...I just don't get in this day and age how a hotel can still charge you for wifi. Then after a week of travelling down California we had quite a bit of washing...on average they charge about 6 per item. so it would have been over 100 just to wash a few items of clothing...luckily we found a laundrette on 4th avenue. (and free wifi in a caf round the corner)That's the bad stuff out of the way!Now the good stuff!Great location to discover San Diego. Was a walk to Balboa Park...and a walk to the harbour. They sent us a bottle of Champagne and strawberries in chocolate as a honeymoon gift (the only hotel on our honeymoon that acknowledged our celebration - not that we expect any freebies but it is nice!)The room was great...modern clean and spaciousTheres a nice rooftop area with seating bar and a small poolThe staff were very friendly and helpful.Breakfast is situated at the adjoining caf which was nice.So almost full marks but not quite!First off Lifeshouldbeaholiday, I love your username and 100 agree, life should be a holiday! Thank you for the candor used while sharing feedback regarding your visit with us. So happy to see that our team took such fantastic care of you and congratulations on your marriage! I know those additional charges can add up quickly, we do offer complimentary internet for our Kimpton Karma Rewards members (which is a free loyalty program) and fortunately the free internet with that program is good at all Kimpton hotels. We do occasionally offer exclusive deals for our Kimpton Karma guests as well that include discounted parking, if you choose to sign up, it will certainly help save some money on those additional charges. I hope we will be able to welcome you back again, maybe for your anniversary if not sooner. Cheers! Shannon
1	Beautiful modern hotel with friendly staff. Had such a fantastic stay, rooms were fabulous, staff were helpful and always there to help, take away coffee in the morning was a god send to start trekking down to fisherman's wharf approx 30 minute walk and 10 minute walk to union square, fabulous location. Caf across the road open from am for early birds and convenient store and sandwich stop on same street.Dear Maz M,Our location is perfect for those visiting Union Square and all the sights of San Francisco. Our highest aim is total guest satisfaction and by sharing you would be inspired to return we know we have done our jobs well. Thank you for choosing to stay with us and leaving this generous review. We hope to welcome you back soon!Luis MoralesHotel Manager
1	Good Hotel Right In The Mix. I did not have any issues while staying at this hotel. The location was very close to the Union Square where I was able to hop onto our tour bus and also had great shopping and food options that were close. The front desk was very helpful with their tips on where to go and what to do around the city.Wow! Thanks for the great feedback on your recent stay at Hotel Diva! It sounds like you had an awesome San Francisco visit and we are pleased you enjoyed our central location and helpful staff. We really appreciate your review and hope to welcome you back next time you are visiting our city. Thanks again.
0	Not worth your money. The room smelt the bathroom was not very clean, there was stuff on the walls. The a.c. was broken so was a light fixture. The tv channels came in blurry and staticy. But the location was great
0	Never again..... You get what you pay for. The rooms were old and beat up. I slept all of 2 hours the whole night as I felt like there were bugs crawling on me in the bed. I couldn't wait to get out of there. Breakfast was....a joke. Spend the extra and stay at a better hotel.
0	Noisy. We stayed her as part of our Honeymoon trip recommended by the local Tourist Board. We were very disappointed on arrival the hotel was built in the early 1900, however they have not spent much money on the property, Carpets were grim and dull and walls and paintwork was cracked , mould and paint peeling off. Bathroom was tiny, while sitting on the loo you were able to rest your head on the wall in front of you. Shower just about dribbled out so you barely got wet. They were working in two rooms with lots of concrete and dust, we were not told this at the time of making our reservation, which was on the day of arrival. The hotel also had an evening event taking place in the ballroom and our room was overlooking part of the courtyard where everyone spilled out to during breaks and when it finished the noise was so bad it was as if we were lying in the middle of a nightclub. We were kept awake after driving over 300 miles and on honeymoon. Breakfast was very limited/basic in fact with very low cost items and plastic plates/cups ect. Not what I would expect having paid over 100Thank you for your review. We try to notify all guests of events in our ballroom and I am sorry that we failed to do so when you checked in. I sincerely regret the disturbance to you and your wife. In the future, if you have any trouble in your room or otherwise, please alert the front desk and we will be happy to move you to a more suitable room. Your feedback is very important to us and appreciated as it helps us to make improvements. Best, Kristin Anderson Assistant Hotel ManagerThe Highland Inn
1	orlando hotel. Hotel's rooms are very spacious. The staff was super friendly. good location. The only thing that was a light bit negative is that I had a suite becuase I knew I would need the pull out couch. There were no blankets or pillows left for the pull out bed. It was clean and had sheets. The suite was very spacious and affordable.Thank you fro providing us with your feedback of our property. I'd like to start by apologizing for any of the inconveniences that you may have experienced during your stay as far as the sheets for the pull-out. I do hope that the front desk was able to give you the extra sheets upon request. I am however glad that the rest of your stay was enjoyable and we hope that you will choose to stay with us again given the opportunity.
0	Tripped out experience. This place is a dump! It rides off the coat tails of being haunted, but I guess the only ghost here is the maintenance person. The place has everything antique, but that's no excuse for having crappy accommodations. The bathroom towel rack is secured with a piece of wire. Also, despite the king size bed headboard being beautiful, you can... More
0	poor first impression for my family. We had a 5 am flight at Orlando airport, so decided to stay the night before at the Hilton garden in as it is a 5 minute drive to the airport. The hotel was perfect for that reason. We were unhappy with the quality of the room as it had not be serviced correctly. We were not an early check in. We checked in after 5 pm but our room had dried pee on the toilet and a used soap bar with hair on it in the shower. It is a simple fix for the hotel but just an awful experience when they make these mistakes to ready a room. The nightly fee for the room was 219 per night, so I have a higher expectation for the quality of the room for that price range. if it had been sub 100, the value would have offset the lack of quality controlOn behalf of our entire team, I would like to offer my sincerest apologies for the service issues in your room. There are no excuses for the issues you experienced. We have inspection procedures in place to make sure things like this don't occur and clearly we dropped the ball this time. I am working directly with our housekeeping supervisors to review and tighten current procedures to make sure that we deliver a superb stay every time. Again, I apologize, and I hope that you will stay with us again so that we can have another chance to give you the clean, comfortable accommodations that you deserve!Thank you for being our guest and taking time to share your feedback with us.All the Best,Debra Thompson-FrenchGeneral Manager
1	Hotel excellent in every way!. I can't say enough good things about this hotel. First off the staff ---every single staff member--- was helpful, courteous and went out of their way to go extra mile to make sure our stay was great. The housekeeper even took the time to arrange my kids stuffed animals in fun and creative ways. Second this was the cleanest hotel I've ever stayed at. I'm a slight germ a phobe so hotel rooms can bother me. I was so comfortable in the room because it was so clean. Third, the breakfast was good and had a nice variety. Lastly the little touches like the lemon water at foyer, the milk and cookies at 8 each night and the treasure box for the kids at check out all made the stay extra memorable. Thank you for a wonderful stay. Heather
0	Not what was in the images or described by Hotel staff. I basically live out of hotels and this is the WORST I have ever seen. Staring with parking you are paying 12.00 for a spot that you have to do a 3 point turn to get into and my Camry almost didnt fit into. The room was super small for being a family suite and everything was cramped. The was enough space between the foot of the bed and the tv table was wide enough for a vacuum to fit though as well as the space between the bed and the wall. The second room was divided by a French door only the fixed side of the French door had window covering so there is no privacy between rooms and the lights from either room shines into each other. The AC was weak and smelt like mold. The second room never got air and by the time you go to the bathroom forget it just open the window to let the air in. There is no circulation, except what was provided by a large fan in the wall between rooms that was extremely loud and reminded me of an attic fan. One good thing the bed was comfortable for a single night stay. This location does offer breakfast, but after making a waffle and getting a plate together and sitting down to eat each of us took a bite and ended up at Dennys down the street. I wasnt expecting a Hilton or the Ritz Carlton, but I was expecting something a little higher than what ended up looking like highway motel. Lucky for us we were there only one night before heading home to Los Angeles.Dear Guest,Thank you very much for your honest and detailed feedback on your recent stay at our hotel. Your feedback is extremely valuable to us, as we strive to improve with each and every stay. I greatly appreciate your comments about aspects of the room that need updating. It is a pleasure to announce that we will be implementing many of these upgrades to the property within the next couple of months. Our rooms will be getting new mattresses, bed skirts, window treatments, carpeting, in-room accessories, and much more! In taking great care of our charming hotel, our main priority is to be able to offer a very well-maintained and comfortable atmosphere. I hope that I can convince you to change your mind about another visit to our property. Please reach out to me directly at Laura.bensoninterstatehotels.com, if you would be willing to give us a chance to turn your experience around. It would be such a pleasure to personally welcome you back to our new and improved hotel!With much appreciation,Laura BensonOperations Manager619-881-4004
1	Convenient, clean and quiet.. My wife and I recently spent 5 nights at the Whitney Hotel. We chose it for its mid-way location between the WWII and the Ogden Art Museums, and the French Quarter. It is also only a block from the Charles St. trolley to the Garden District.Our 6th floor king-bed room was a little small by king standards, but didn't feel cramped. The only smallness inconvenience was a lack of night stand and light on one side of the bed (no room). The bed and pillows were excellent and the room clean. The bath room had ample space for both of our toiletry bags, and there was a nice tub/shower with great towels. The provided shampoo and other products were of high quality.Since our room was directly above Poydras Street, a busy thoroughfare, we expected some noise and on the first night, which coincided with a Saints NFL game, we got it. However the noise subsided about 10 PM after the game traffic cleared and each of the subsequent nights were pleasantly quiet. The A/C was efficient and quiet.This is a smaller hotel (compared with the mammoth nearby Sheraton) and the staff were always available and pleasant. There is a restaurant on the premises (we only had one breakfast there - very good) but many, many fine restaurants in all price ranges are within 5-10 min walking distance. I felt the hotel was a great value for the price and would gladly stay again.We're so happy to hear you enjoyed your stay at the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans! Thank you for the great review and we look forward to seeing you again soon. Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
1	Exceptional spa and fitness facilities!. This is an older hotel but far from beyond it's prime! They have done a fine job of keeping it updated. I love the way the rooms all open up to the main open area. The brick mosaics on the outside of the building are unlike anything I have ever seen. I loved the steam room and fitness area. The showers and little lounge area near the gym are wonderful. I almost stayed down there and left my poor husband in the room with two crazy kids! It was very quite even though there were many gatherings going on this weekend. The only problem we had was the jerk who had the room before us set the alarm for midnight and it shocked us awake. It took about an hour to get back to sleep. Just plain rude!Thank you for the deailed notes on your recent visit with us. I am glad you enjoyed your stay and had a chance to go to our fitness cente. I hope you were able to squeeze in enough time to visit our spa too I will share your experience with the alarm clock with my team to ensure we are double checking clocks when we clean the rooms. Sees like we could have caught that for you. Hope to see you back at the Waverly soon!
0	Suffice. Well, I'm stayed in much better motels and some worse, though I made do with this one. First off they put me in a room that had not been serviced since the last guest. Walked in and like wow, is someone in here! Obviously they were long gone but not a good feeling. Called the front desk and they put me in another room. My new room seemed clean, though motel in general is a little run down. Motel itself is actually 3 separate buildings and I was in the south one. Area is fine and I felt safe walking around outside at night. Couple of real good honky tonks right next door (recommend Nashville Palace), though down side if you want peace and quiet you won't get it until they close up at around 2am. The outside pool is across the parking lot right up beside a Bar and Grill (Scoreboard - another fine honky tonk), though not like I was going to partake in outside pool in January anyway though is strange where the pool is located. By far the best about this motel is the location. Everything you need is within walking distance. All in all it was okay though not sure I would take family to stay there, though good for just me and would stay there again. All depends on your level of expectations, if they are low to average, you should be fine, if high, go somewhere else. Get what you pay for.
0	Gross. Over priced, old, and gross. We arrived in our very small room to towels that someone with a bad cold blew their nose in. Yes, that was left for us. The front desk laughed when they saw it. Maybe they laughed because they had to come back in from smoking to help. The bathrooms are similar to what you'd find... More
0	Nice but terrible service!. I was here a month ago for a business meeting for 3 nights. Somehow my points dint transfer to my account and their was no record of it Really! The hotel is nice looking and food was okay not great. And parking should be free. Paying 15 bucks a night is redundant. There is no curtsey whats so ever...... Not coming here anymore or any four Points.Thank you for taking the time to write a review. We strive to make all of our guests feel welcome, so we regret to hear about your experience. Your feedback is important to us and we want to make this right. Please reach out to me so I can make sure you receive your Starpoints and so we can discuss your review further.

0	No non-smoking rooms available at check-in. Place is old, smoky, and run down. The location is awkward to get to.
1	"Un sjour plus que convenable!. Nous avons pass 9 jours dans cet htel et nous avons t trs bien accueillis par un personnel fort sympathique. Le jardin nous a enchant: trs bien entretenu et agrable  parcourir pour aller de sa chambre vers les diffrentes piscines et btiments. Nous avons occup une chambre tout au fond du parc , l'quipement est bien sans tre extraordinaire , confortable sans tre luxueux, et mme en de d'un ""resort"" o nous avions pass une nuit  Saint Martin (chambre quipe , grand lit , cuisine complte et ustensile, terrasse...).Nous prenions nos petits djeuners au Max deli's  l'intrieur  prix trs abordable. Il y a un arrt du trolley juste en face de l'htel et l'aroport n'est pas trs loin. La dernire nuit passe au bar o nous avons pu commander des cocktails divers et rigoler avec le barman tout en coutant le pianiste fut trs agrable."
1	Very well maintained and great hospitality. My wife and I stayed at this hotel for three nights (Fri to Sun). We checked in around 9 PM and the staff was very cordial. After entering the room we realized that during the time of booking, we did not specify the type of room we want and hence ended up getting one with two Queen beds. My wife called the front desk and asked if we can get a King Bed. They accommodated us immediately and a staff member brought the new room keys to us. This was great since we did not have to go back to the front desk.The room:- The room was modest in size with a balcony and chairs to sit- South wing rooms had a great view of the indoor+outdoor pool while the North wing rooms had a view of some concrete ground and a covered up swimming pool- Air conditioning was working well and the hot water was consistent- We did not like the bed that much as we had minor back pain every morning. Fortunately it was not that bad.Food:We ate in the hotel restaurant only once. We had a breakfast of French Toast and pancakes. The food was decent and the price reasonable. The bar had about a dozen beers on the tap. Moose Drool was my favorite.Service:Throughout our stay, the service was excellent. Every staff member was professional, yet friendly and very helpful.Here are some of the additional expenses you may want to consider.Parking: 28 per dayBasic Internet: 13 per dayHigh speed Internet: 17 per dayDear Bhaskar, thank you very much for taking the time to write about your stay with us. I am very happpy to hear that you and your wife enjoyed your time and our hotel! Perhaps we can welcome you again some time in the future! Wishing you safe travels, Dieter Heigl
1	Great for business trips - not so quiet suites - very slow service. Very smartly located next to the Metreon and the conference center as well as the MOMA. If you are in town for a conference this is for you!If you are a tourist then this is not your best bet as this hotel sits two blocks South of Market St.Suites are very large and boast a dining room, a TV area with a large sofa, a separate bedroom and an expansive bathroom (separate toilets). Amenities are from Remde so top of the line. You will find those products in their Remde spa as well (located on the 6th floor).Gym + indoor pool.Metropolitan suites come with a 24/24 private butler service but expect a VERY slow service. If you order a bottle of champagne to treat your big clients in your suite expect to wait at least 30 min.No coffee maker, no tea kettle, nothing that you can make yourself. Each and every cup of coffee/tea must be ordered through the butler service and expect another long wait.No extra comforter, pillows.Summary: nice and large suites but service can definitely be improved.Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to review The St. Regis San Francisco. We are pleased that you enjoyed our guestroom dcor and spa amenities during your stay. I appreciate your comments about the Butler service, and apologize for the inconvenience that the delay caused you. I encourage you to contact me directly so that we may discuss the details of your stay and how we may improve your experience. Sincerely,William FongHotel Manager415-284-4057
1	I cannot believe anyone is complaining about this hotel!!!. I thought I would have a look to see what others thought of this wonderful place and could not believe my eyes when I saw negative comments.I was in orlando for business and was moved to this hotel half way through my stay for geographical reasons. Upon my arrival the staff were very friendly, accomodating and professional. I was told shuttle buses to the airport left every 20 minutes were I could transfer to a variety of Lynx bus routes. I did not have a car during my trip but from what I saw of the car park, it looked just like any other. The shuttle drivers were very pleasent especially Angel and Brian. I used the shuttle several times during my trip.As for the rooms I have absolutly no complaints! They were full suits with a living area and bedroom area. Especially as I was on my own it was VERY spacious. There was a fridge, microwave, coffee maker, hair dryer as well as 2 TV's (1 in each area of the room). The pool area/courtyard was very tranquil with palm trees and other shrubbery. There were some small live animals around (frogs, gheckos etc) but these are found throughout florida anyway. The pool was a combination outdoor/indoor pool with a divider in the wall and chairs or sunbeds in both areas. Sadly the jacuzzi was out of use but these things happen.All meals were wonderful, especially the american breakfast buffet which had hot and cold choices. The evening meals were delicious even if a little expensive but again that's what you get in hotels.To be blunt if what you want is a palace then ask the Queen of England if you can come for a visit otherwise this will suit the needs of any normal person. The only draw back to this hotel is that if you want to visit the theame parks, you are very far away.
0	Hilton Head. Wifi was totally non existent! Staff was neither friendly nor unfriendly.
0	Dont book hotel. To basic of an hotel for 150 bucks a night. Tiny room. Squeaky bed. We couldn't even enjoy being intimate cause they squeaked so much loudy. They dont have bathrooms in the room. It felt like i was in solitary confinment cause the room was so plain. Didnt have any curtain on the window so i had no choice... More
0	EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. We stayed at La Hacienda because it was close to the SafeCo field and we had to get to a Mariner's game. We decided it was only for one night and we would leave immediately int the morning. The service was bad, with non-english speaking staff. The shower and sink did not drain and when we complained to the employees they did nothing to fix it. The carpet was dirty, there were spots on the wall where the wallpaper was ripping off and they had tried to patch it. The TV didn't work and there were creepy people hanging around the parking lot. The next day we discovered there were bedbugs in the beds, as one member of our group had gotten bitten in quite a few places. It was certainly not worth the money.
0	Hotel trying their best, but facility is just old. The staff was very nice but the rooms are just old. Had a strange smell to the room and my daughter actually got congested while we were staying there. It may not have had anything to do with the room but you can't help but wonder. The breakfast was nice. Hotel just needs a major renovation. We felt safe in the area.
1	Recently remodeled and updated. Very nice updates to this Marriott.The restaurant and lobby area is very nice. Lobby can be loud at night with everyone enjoying happy hour.The gym is very nice, but a little tricky to find in the pool area.Concierge lounge is nice, but tiny. Great food and service.We had a meeting here, and they did everything they could to accommodate us and our needs. I asked for a Diet Sierra Mist, and they brought me 4 of them in a bowl with ice, and a glass with ice.My only complaint would be the shuttle ride to and from the airport. Its is long, and makes many stops, including to the Marriott O'Hare Suites. If time is on your side, or you are totally cheap, take the shuttle. However, if you want to get into your bed and be to sleep as soon as possible, take a cab. It runs between 16-20 bucks.Dear sttcarrie:Thank you very much for spending the time to write about your stay and your very positive experience with your meeting. Indeed the travel time to the hotels in the area is lenghty at times, the airport restrict all shuttle pick up to only the bus center in terminal two which creates traffic jams at times. We do run our shuttles every 20 minutes throughout the day and make every effort to be on time. Thank you again for staying with Marriott!Wishing you happy holidays and safe travels.

When I first arrived at this motel I did not realize what I was getting my self into the first night was ok no major problems no more than to be expected from a motel right next to a bar.

0	Terrible Hotel. Very horrible customer service at the beginning of our stay and during our stay, We are.very disappointed with this hotel. The walls are paper thin. The customer service rep hung up on me as I was describing how loud the guest was next door.
1	Great stay. We stayed here wilt our grandson and his Dalmatian dog and we had a terrific stay! Julia was joking with our grandson about how big the dog was and he thought that was great, everyday when we got back to the hotel he was looking for her to talk to about what he and the dog did, and by the end of our stay he was hugging her goodbye. Housekeeping was also terrific, never ran out of anything. Keep up the good worklwill789,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor. We are thrilled to hear that you, your grandson and his Dalmatian dog created wonderful memories throughout Seattle and utilized the amenities within our beautiful new hotel. I will pass on your kind words to the staff, they will all be bursting with excitement knowing they made a difference. We are always trying to leave our guests with lasting memorable experiences. Please let us know when you plan on returning to Seattle as we would love to you welcome you as our guest again!Sarah Junge
1	Whitney. Excellent service and location was perfect. Have been in New Orleans numerous times so we didnt need to be in the heart of French Quarter which could be very noisy. dont get me wrong, love a good time let the good times roll but when I want to sleep I prefer quite.. Staff very helpful , great new restaurants in warehouse district....Thank you for the great review and for your recent visit to the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans. We certainly appreciate the kind words and we are looking forward to hosting your next trip to the Big Easy!Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
0	Dated, tired and in dire need of total renovation!. Only thing nice about the property was the friendly staff, room layout and decent location. The property has nothing else to offer!
0	Don't bother.. Forget staying there. Unless you want a trashed out hotel room, with clueless employees. Room that we booked was not available (King) so we ended up having to take a double room. First room we were given had nothing but cement floor in it. Clerk didn't know that entire floor was under construction. 2nd room, door wouldn't work, were told... More
0	Absolutely Pathetic Attempt at a Hotel. Stayed in the 'annex' rooms. FIRST OF ALL... the elevators weren't working!! So we all had to lug our luggage up to the 4th floor!! (seriously) Walked in and it looked like an old dirty motel room that they attempted to cover up with a fresh coat of paint (that wasn't really working-chips and marks everywhere) and some cheap 'mod' furniture. When they say that the hotel is retro, it really means they were too cheap to update it from the 60s 2 star motel it must have been previously. My friends and I tried to ignore it and wanted to listen to some music and have some drinks before heading out. The ice machine wasn't working either! big surprise... okay, so what about the Ipod dock it said would be in the room None to be found... called down to the front desk and told them to get us one.. got a call back saying sorry they are all out tonight. COOL. What else The mirror that they show in the online picture above the tv/dresser wasn't there! There is only one tiny mirror in the gross bathroom. This place is really just pathetic.
1	A fabulous place to stay near the Space Needle. My plans to use my 2 free hyatt nights in Mexico fell through but time was running out so even though I thought I was going to be wasting them by staying at Hyatt House in Seattle, I didn't have a choice. As it turns out, I made an excellent choice. Though not a luxury hotel in Mexico, our visit to Hyatt House was wonderful! Check in was straightforward and easy (with the best service ever, but more on that later). Once we were moved (by request) out of the strange angled corner room with a view that looked out on another room, we were absolutely delighted with our stay!! The room was surprisingly quiet despite being next to the street and near the Seattle Center Activities. We loved the location, literally across the street from the Space Needle! The view of the Space Needle outside our window was romantic and the rooftop terrace provide an unparalleled 360 degree view of the city. The room layout was really cool and the decor is very modern (like a boutique hotel). The bed was very comfortable (firm but not hard). A (very) minor complaint is the textured fabric of the bedspread, which was a bit rough to the touch, but the sheets were crisp and smooth. Another minor detail was that I missed having a tub for soaking, but the rain shower turned out to be fine (lots of space in shower, could use a seat or shelf for sitting) Lots of storage space (as well as hangers) if you are staying a few days and want to unpack. The kitchen was fully stocked including dish soap, which seems unusual in hotels these days for some reason I don't understand. The free hotel shuttle was a great value and breakfast was decent- a pretty good selection though crowded on Sunday morning. he only thing that wasn't perfect about our stay was the fact that housekeeping never came the second day. We put the sign on the door and saw the housekeeper next door as we were leaving, but for some reason our room was skipped. It's always nice to come home to a freshened-up room and a made bed. We had enough towels to get us through, so it was fine, especially given that everything else was so good. Saving the best part for last, let me say that more than anything I have described, what we liked most by far, about our stay at Hyatt House, was the absolutely amazing service provided by Eden at the front desk! Everyone at the front desk was truly great, but she was a shining star! I'm not sure I've ever experienced a more genuine welcome or felt as appreciated as a customer as she made my husband and I feel. Thanks to her, this was a perfect weekend getaway!
0	Filthy room and rude attendant. I have never had to ask for a refund due to cleanliness of room. I asked for a refund on this very dirty room. The attendant lady was violently screaming and refused to give me a refund. She forced me to wait for her to arrive at the room to retrieve my belongings. She was screaming incessantly. I told her...

0	Not happy with the room. The room was not clean, The light did not work over the vanity and the TV did not work. Had we known the TV did not work before morning we would've asked for another room.
1	My favorite hotel in San Diego!. Estancia La Jolla is my favorite hotel getaway in San Diego. Its lush gardens, fantastic service and comfortable guestrooms always provide a relaxing retreat. My family and I stay at Estancia often and are always impressed by this hotel. Last weekend I treated myself to a day at the spa. The treatments were some of the best I've had...and I've beem to a lot spas. Brisa the spa manager did a great job in creating the services and the therapist Mazey was simply...amazing! We enjoyed the pool and the carne asada tacos and margaritas were delectable. Highly recommend Estancia La Jolla!Your 5-star review is much appreciated and we thank you for taking the time to share all your positive remarks with is. It is wonderful to hear you so greatly enjoyed your time at the spa and your wonderful comments will surely be shared with the staff. Again, thank you for taking the time to write such a lovely review, we look forward to your next stay with us!

1	New Orleans Hospitality at its Finest!. Special birthday trip for 5 days. We narrowed our choices on Hotels.com to finally choose The Whitney. We stay at many 'upscale' hotels in our business travels, and wanted an 'experience'. Location - perfect, a couple of blocks to the French Quarter, 3 or 4 to the Riverwalk, great food nearby. Starting with Earl (the Pearl) checking us in, and Michelle (long brown hair) made us feel comfortable far beyond the typical experience. They were knowledgeable and available for any of our needs wants, as other staff including housekeeping, they are great!Cleanliness rates a 10+Southern Hospitality 10+We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your visit to the New Orleans and thank you for staying at the Whitney Hotel. Your feedback is valuable to us and I'll share your great comments with our staff. If we can be of any other assistance to you, please feel free to call us directly. We look forward to hosting your next visit to the Big Easy!Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral ManagerCasey.CallaisWhitneyHotel.com
1	Awesome experience! Right on the beach. My DH and I recently stayed here for our anniversary. We are a local couple who just needed to get away for a night. The staff of this hotel was one of the best parts. I cannot remember the name of the front desk attendent when we checked in - maybe Michael But he was great - very helpful on where to dine and drink. He also told us all about the breakfast offered at the hotel and all the other nice ammenities (free breakfast, one of the NICEST pool areas in all of PB!). The room was clean, the bed comfortable and the view was SPECTACULAR! The otel is small which we prefer. It is quiet right on the boardwalk close to great food and nightlife. In the morning we drank our coffee on our balcony and watched the waves roll in. It was an amazing anniversary and one that will not soon be forgotten thank to Ocean Park Inn's great hospitality. We will be visiting again when we can get a night away fron real life!We're elated to hear our hospitality made your anniversary trip so enjoyable and memorable! The staff is also very happy to know you noticed how clean the pool and surrounding area is - our head engineer treats the pool like his own and is very proud of it. We look forward to seeing you for many future anniversary trips!
1	Great location!. Great location, close to where I need to go. Friendly staff, clean room! Got free upgrade to a suite. It will be very convenient for a family travel. The two bathrooms and bedrooms are at the two ends of the suite. The sitting area and the kitchen are in the center of the suite. Hello huagiy,We are delighted to hear we were able to provide a complimentary upgrade to one of our suites and you were able to enjoy it! We strive for excellent service and cleanliness and it appears we hit the mark on your stay. Thanks for choosing to stay at Chicago River Hotel!
0	I wouldn't come here again. The room was ok. I stayed there from Friday to Monday. We couldn't even get a late check out. Check out was at 12. And we were only able to get until 12:30, and even then, they made it seem like a complete hassle. The internet was terrible. It would go in and out the entire time. As we were checking out, we wanted to microwave some food and were told the guest microwave was broken. We asked if there was another microwave we could use and were told the only one the guests could use was broken. Also, I've stayed in my fair share of hotels, and when I've booked through the hotel directly, as I did for this trip, I never had to pay the full amount upon check-in. I would pay a deposit and then be charged this full amount upon check-out. But here, I had to pay for the room, plus a deposit when I checked in. I thought that was weird. When we got into the room, it was hot and muggy. The A/C hadn't been turned on before our arrival (something I thought was common practice). Thankfully, we had our own fan to use while we waited for the A/C to kick in. Also, the fridge had been unplugged, so we had to wait to use that as well. I don't know if they don't clean very well or what, but the entire time I was in the hotel room, my allergies acted up. I've traveled to San Diego many times and stayed in various hotels and never before were my allergies affected until this time. Also, the last night of the trip, the fire alarm started chriping with a low battery every 30 secs starting around 5am or so. The best thing about the hotel was its location, but I couldn't see myself coming here again. It was in Hotel Circle, so I could throw a rock and hit another hotel I could stay in.Dear Lytrell M.,Thank you for taking the time to review our property and for being our guest. We are glad that you appreciated our convenient location. Based on your reservation details, we see that you booked an Internet Only special rate. For that reason, a full deposit restriction is mandated with this special discounted rate. Also, to prevent fraudulent transactions, and to cover any incidentals incurred during the guests stay, a valid credit card is required to be presented upon check-in. We do apologize for any confusion and for not being able to extend your late check-out request any further than 12:30 pm. Late check-outs are a courtesy for our guests and are based on our occupancy. We apologize for failing to meet your expectations and would be happy to host your next visit to San Diego and provide you with an excellent stay given the chance. Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management Staff
1	Enjoyed my stay. Quick one night stay in Nov 2017. Staff was very courteous and I was upgraded to a large room on the executive floor. Decor is a bit dated but overall well maintained.Location is excellent - the hotel is co-located inside the Lenox Square Mall complex so you're a short drive / walk away from many stores and restaurants.The breakfast experience in the executive lounge is typical of these large chain hotels selection of food isn't anything to write home about and the space isn't large (see pic) but you have very nice views of downtown Atlanta.Overall, it was a positive experience but I might consider staying at the Ritz Carlton next time I'm in Buckhead.Joe M - so happy you decided to stay with us and glad you enjoyed the hotel and location. I do hope you will choose the JW Marriott Buckhead the next time you visit.
1	Car a benefit in this location. The shuttle to the station wasn't always as available as implied, however it was quite an easy walk. If you have a UK mobile calling for the shuttle for a return trip from the station could be a problem but there were pay phones available. When we first went to our allocated room we were disappointed to have a brick wall just a few feet from the window. Upon request we were immediately moved to another room. The two minor problems we had with the room (safe and iron) were rectified quickly. In view of other comments we found the breakfast to be really disappointing and eventually decided to eat elsewhere. A car for a week is cheaper than a taxi to and from Dulles airport.
0	Five star pricing for a two star hotel. Was promised early check-in...didn't get it. One room was partially cleaned. Restaurant was extremely slow, the food was mediocre and pricey. Internet was really slow. Self parking for only 24 per day. Four or five star priced hotel for a two star (at the most) venue.
0	Dirty, Smelly, and Bugs!. We checked in and the front lobby looks nice. The lady gave us our key card and we went to our room. We turned the lights on, the room smelt like mold. We turned the bathroom lights on and bugs were crawling all over the floor and walls. So we went back and asked for another room. They gave us a different room. When we got to that room, it smelt like smoke and not mold and again bugs all in the bath tub! Just a gross hotel.
0	Disappointed to say the least. I called the Ramada the morning I was checking in to verify the check in time as well as verify that the room type I requested would be available, I was assured it would be. When I arrived a few hours later, the room type was unavailable. They also had a sign posted indicating the water would be off until 3:30pm. I should have received some sort of notification or gotten some sort of compensation for this considering the water was not back on until 5:45 or so. When I turned the faucet on the water was brown and disgusting - I certainly was not going to get ice or regular water from this establishment.Wi-Fi was incredibly spotty. No password, less than ZERO security. Disappointed.
1	Great Room and Good Location. We really enjoyed our stay at the Four Points. The hotel is well furnished, clean, and comfortable. The bathroom is generously sized and updated.I enjoyed the stair access in the lobby so that I didn't have to take the elevator constantly. Our door did not close all the way - we just had to make sure we pulled it completely closed.My only criticism was the toiletries in the shower and the shower handle are poorly placed. I hit my elbow a few times and the toiletries caddy makes it hard to wash your hair under the shower.Hello,Well first of all I want to Thank you for staying with us at Four Points Sea World. We appreciate you taking the time to write a review, not to mention the very nice comments. Your feedback about the amenity caddy is much appreciated, I will have that looked into. We hope to see you back some time soon.Thank you,LBGeneral Manager
1	It's fine.. It's a typical generic Marriott hotel and convenient if you're attending a convention. The mall with more restaurants is walking distance but they're all chains. The line for breakfast was quite long all four days I was there- get there early or be prepared to wait.Thank you for taking the time to give us your feedback. I am sorry that you had to wait in line for breakfast, that is not usually the case but we had a large convention in the hotel. I hope we have the chance to have you back with us and earn a fifth star!
0	Hotel stay ruined due to problems at the pool/hotel overcharge that was not removed for 5 days.. Hotel stay was ruined 1) the pool closed on the 2nd day due to child's toilet accident. Hotel staff then shocked the pool, and opened it several hours later. However, 2) no warning sign was put out to inform guests that shocked indoor pools are dangerous for people with respiratory problems. Had to end stay at Hotel early due to sudden severe respiratory problems that developed at the pool on 2nd day. My Dr. later informed me that the chemicals in the air from the shocked pool caused my respiratory problems. Hotel also put, unknown 115 charge on our CC after we left, even though we used our Wyndam Rewards points. Manager of hotel failed to respond to written complaints left at the desk. General Manager failed to return several phone calls in a timely manner, and finally told us that Wyndham did not do anything wrong It was a CYA response. Our vacation was ruined. I had to have 7 Rxs filled + Emergency visit to my Dr. who felt I might need to go to the ER. No cleaning staff ever came to our room to clean it.Hello dalef565,Thank you for taking the time to give our business the Wingate by Wyndham Atlanta Galleria. I apologize for the inconvenience you experienced while staying at our Wingate hotel, the pool was in working condition. The incident that happened we did have to take the correct protocol by shocking the pool to insure that no one is harmed by the chemical or the bile. We did check all pool levels and tested the water before allowing anyone in the pool. I have discussed this situation with my entire management staff to ensure that we change the look of our hotel. We do care as a staff about every situation that goes on at our hotel good or bad. Our goal is to provide a level of service that requires diligent attention to detail and is a matter of constant reinforcement of our hotel. Once again, we are truly sorry for any inconvenience we caused you. If there is anything else we can assist you with in the future, please don't hesitate to call.

1	Great overnight stay, close to the airport, close to the city. We booked an overnight stay at Hampton Inn in December. We usually stay at the Renaissance when we stay near the airport, but that hotel was booked, so we found the Hampton. We don't regret it one bit! We would definitely stay here again.Check-in was prompt and the staff was friendly. Our room was ready immediately upon arrival at 3PM. We got a room on the 5th floor with a nice view of the city skyline. The room was clean and spacious. We booked at king- bed room with a pull-out sofa bed and all four of us (all adults) slept comfortably. The HVAC unit was very efficient. When we came in there was cold air blowing, but after a slight thermostat adjustment it was very cozy. There is free Wi-fi in the rooms. All you need to log in is your name and room , so that was very convenient. We didn't notice any noise from neighboring rooms, but several doors slamming in the hallway at 5AM did not go unnoticed. I guess one should expect that from an airport hotel, however, since most travelers will be leaving early to catch a flight. An airport shuttle runs fairly frequently, but we weren't flying on this trip so we didn't use it. However, we did need a cab and had the front desk staff call for one. It arrived in less than 5 minutes! For meals, there is a Ruby Tuesday next door. We chose to dine in the city that night. We did, however, enjoy the free breakfast in the morning. Hot food, not just continental fare! The coffee was freshly brewed and the food was plentiful. That morning they served cheese omlettes and turkey sausage but I understand that the menu changes daily.Overall, a good hotel and the price was quite reasonable! We will definitely stay here again.
0	Horrible experience. The room was old, dirty, run down. The rig was filthy. The drapes were torn. I would never stay there again.
1	Excellent service. This is my favourite place to stay at Anaheim. Ms Joy is doing excellent customer service and her service inspired during the stay! Marriott is lucky to have with her!

0	Three people given one bed. I made a reservation at this hotel through the Marriott 800 number using reward points. The reservation was for three people and I later noticed we were given one bed. I called back several times finally speaking to a supervisor (Steven - a woman) who was no help and then hung up on me. I spent several hours on this issue being transferred multiple times to go back to the same queue with non one willing to give me any identifier number (such as an employee number so I could document). One of the worst customer services experiences I have ever had.To be fair, we did not stay at this hotel and cancelled the reservation. It was the Marriott reservations group that earned this one star - the only one star I have ever left on TripAdviosr. I didn't even know it was legal to give three people one bed.I'm so sorry to hear of the confusion and resulting frustration caused by the reservations error. Our Central Reservations team is generally top notch and it is obvious that they dropped the ball in your case.I'm sorry you did not get a chance to experience the hotel, but we certainly hope you may have the opportunity to stay with us in the future.
1	Excellent Choice. We spent 4 nights in the Orchard Garden in June and can highly recommend it. When we arrived our booking (made in April via Orbitz) was not on the system, however, this did not impact our checkin and once I produced the booking confirmation from Orbitz we were checked in within minutes. We found the staff to be friendly, helpful and efficient.The rooms are very comfortable and we thought them to be a good size. As mentioned previously the beds are very comfortable and the room is kept spotlessly clean.Breakfast is included and the homemade scones are not to be missed. Free internet access is also available which is another bonus.The hotel is in an excellent location and I would definitely stay there again.
1	Attractive New Hotel. We chose Aloft because we were able to use our credit card points towards our stay and it was the closest and cheapest we could find the French Quarter. With that being said we are happy with our choice. When we first arrived we were greeted warmly by the front desk staff Jermal was great. We got to our room on the 12th floor and were happy with the amenities. The room was not as large as I would have thought, but it was comfortable and a non issue since we spent minimal time in the room. There was a coffee pot, a mini fridge, and lots of mirror space. Our view overlooked the Ritz Carlton and we were able to see their pool and patio area- pretty cool. The beds are comfortable and the towels didn't feel like sandpaper. They provide Bliss toiletries which was fine, however, I did not pack shampoo or conditioner and they offered a shampoo conditioner all-in-one which I did not care for (but my husband loved...). The vanity area has intense lighting good for makeup application!The lobby area is very nice and fun. They have a snack area for any cravings you have when you are there- premade salads sandwiches, candy, chips, fruit, yogurt, beer, juice, pop, etc. The lobby bar is very nice- good drinks and a fun environment. Lots of games and fun dcor. LaKisha (I hope I spelled that right!) was very friendly and did a great job. They do offer a pool table and computers/printer which came in handy to quickly print our boarding passes. The only issues we ran into was the room service for our room, they did the bare minimum in cleaning our room. The bed was always made, toiletries and towels were always replaced, however, that was about it. No trash was picked up and nothing was organized. When you go to a hotel, typically they neatly arrange your items so they can clean the room/bathroom/vanity completely, but this was not the case. Our toiletries were shoved to a corner or moved over so they could place new toiletries, I had a half eaten sandwich placed on a shelf instead of being thrown away, the coffee pot wasn't put back or the coffee replenished (but new coffee cups were given), whatever was left on the bed was thrown back on it, there was a bottle cap left on the floor... small things that added up. This wasn't huge issue, but enough of one to notice and let the front desk know as we checked out. Also, the elevator functioned oddly for my husband once. He was brought to the top floor and then back down to the lobby instead of being brought to our floor.. but that was not a huge deal.. just odd!Our friends who were staying on the 11th floor experienced some poor water pressure and cold water, however, we did not.The hotel is in a good location- two blocks from Canal and two blocks up from Bourbon- easy walking! The valet out from was super helpful when we were getting ready to leave by reserving us a taxi so we did not have to wait when we wanted one and put our items in the vehicle while we were checking out to make the process smooth and efficient. All in all, the hotel was a great choice and we'd recommend and stay there again. For being brand new, they did a great job!Fantastic! Thank you for your feedback, with us being a new property, reviewers like yourself help us get better! We are thrilled that you liked the property and all of the outlets like our WXYZ Bar and Re:fuel pantry. We cant wait to have you back here with us again soon.We truly appreciate your review and thank you again for staying with aloftnola.- Dixie Krauss, Operations Manager
0	Mold, mildew, dirty and general lack of care. I took my family for a fun filled 4th of July weekend at Disney and we ended up very ill due to mold allergies. The bathroom had extensive mold under the wallpaper and in the grout in the tub. Both my wife and I have allergies to mold and we became very ill and spent the day in bed sick... More
1	Hotel diva. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful from before check in to checking out. Will return to the Diva again for another get away. Location isnt far from the cable cars and great food. The front desk was offering free champagne during the evenings which was a huge plus Wow! Thank you for taking the time to share your 5 star experience at Hotel Diva! We are pleased to hear you received excellent service from our team and we will praise them for a job well done. We are also happy you enjoyed our evening bubbly and look forward to welcome you back in the future.
1	FantSric Birthday Weekend. Kimpton hotels are my go to and the Allegro and their staff are among the best. Came to Chicago with my husband and family for my husband's 50th birthday weekend. I had let them know about it ahead of time and theConcierge had a special present waiting for him! He was beyond pleased and delighted)The concierge also recommended a great restaurant nearby for lunch. And of course the cocktail hour and morning coffee are lovely as well. Thanks to the staff of the Allegro for a long overdue and wonderful weekend!Glad we nailed it and we look forward to seeing you again soon!Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager
1	Good Budget Hotel. I took my almost 13 year old niece to San Diego. We stayed 5 nights at this hotel for a total bill of 307 which is really cheap for San Diego. That price got us a room with 2 queen beds right by the pool (room 103). Room was small as others said but not as small as I thought it would be. There was one night stand between the beds but we could walk around the other sides. The room also had a desk with chair, a dresser, and an upholstered chair. I thought the beds could be more comfortable. There is a plug issue with two outlets where refrig, blow dryer and coffee maker plug in. It wasn't too much of an issue because we just unplugged the refrig when we briefly needed the other appliances. Mirrors didn't bother us and they do make the room feel larger. Room was very clean, bedding was clean and of fairly good guality. Probably the biggest negative was thin walls and doors that you could not close quietly. So we heard noise above us and we were bolted awake one morning by a neighbor 's slamming door at 6:30am. Plenty of free parking. beautiful grounds, sparkling clean pool, nice jacuzzi and great location. Hotel shuttle driver was very nice and reception crew was always helpful. I also appreciated the free computer in the lobby to print our boarding passes. I would stay at this hotel on another trip to San Diego.
1	Location Atmosphere. What you get for the price is a steal of a deal. The decorations are very unique classy so I loved it visually. The staff are very friendly and helpful. They keep the grounds very clean and up to date. The rooms, are small, but that didn't bother me as I wasn't there to spend time in my room. The bathroom was beautiful and very clean, yet again, small. The walls are thin, so if anyone talks loudly, you can hear them. I loved that the offer complimentary wine every evening, with generous portions. I would go back because location, cleanliness and staff, it was well worth the price I paid. Thanks for the nice time!Thanks for the lovely review! We're happy to see you were able to take advantage of our daily social hour and we hope to see you again in the future!Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager
0	VERY DISAPPOINTED!. Coming from Texas I booked online and checked all the pictures available before and it was good. But when I got there this one was terrible specially considering that it is a prime location for tourism in orlando. Walls were peeling off, very dirty, sink was not working neither the hair dryer. No refrigerator or microwave, when I went downstairs to get ice, machine does not work either. Black mold in the shower and lamps that did not work. Original carpet was replaced without removing the sides showing old carpet. At the website they say free wifi and breakfast.... Free wifi yes but no breakfast.
1	Great Location to Downtown Area. I have stayed at this location several times and have found it a short walk to the convention center and close to attractions and restaurants. The Aloft is a modern style hotel and has a comfortable social atmosphere.Thank you for your feedback. We are always excited to find that we have so many repeating guests that enjoy our property! Thank you for keeping us in mind and at the top of your list when you are traveling to Atlanta. Since you have stayed with us multiple times in the past, you know how we as a hotel run. If there is any feedback, good or bad, that you have for us we would love to hear it! We are constantly growing and hearing from our guests that have stayed with us several times helps us become the best Aloft we can be! Thank you again for your response.
1	Best for families. We had two rooms for one night here, just staying over with some family after a college graduation ceremony. It was Memorial weekend, so understandably full of lots of families with younger children. The rooms were clean I appreciate the sheets covering the blanket and the fitted bottom sheet on the bed. Two areas in the room separated by glass doors. Two TV's, wi-fi, small frig and microwave:) Our internet rate was very reasonable for the area, especially considering it was a suite. They do charge 8 for parking most we have stayed at in the Hotel Circle area don't. The downtown hotels in San Diego almost all charge for parking, and charge a lot more. This is a pretty central location to get to all of San Diego's attractions. The breakfast was fairly standard, but is a good convenience to have to get something to eat in the AM before taking off to do touristy things.We sincerely appreciate you taking the time to submit your nice comments about your recent stay with us. We are glad you and your family enjoyed our suites with two separate living/sleeping areas and all their standard extra features. A survey of competing hotels in our immediate area found most do have a parking charge as we do, but we feel our competitive rates, unique room suites, and central location more than offset this. It is nice to know you enjoyed our free breakfast buffet. We are constantly adding new items and try to offer changing daily selections. Many of our guests also like that they can choose to eat in the breakfast room or on the adjoining patio overlooking the pool. We hope you had the opportunity to enjoy both and that you will choose to say with us again on your next visit. Sincerely, Elizabeth Ming, General Manager
0	very unfriendly front desk personnel. Wendy at the front desk was very unfridently. The hallway at the floor was dirty. TV in the room was not working, no channel. Wendy was not accommodate customer's need at all, Over half hour tried to fix the TV with no success. Ask for Change room, she said no. Even at the beginning, Wendy told us plenty of room available.
0	Low chance to come back here. If you get the room that they advertised on the website and for what you paid, you may be lucky.If you stay many days , they will give you the not so good rooms.Nobody wants to stay in these rooms: low light/dark rooms, near pool, noisy, smelly bathrooms, or difficult access. If you stay one-two days you will get probably... More

1	Business Trip to Dallas TX. This was my first time traveling to Dallas TX. I attended a five day conference at the Hilton Anatole and the location of the Hilton Garden Inn was very oonvienient being across the street and walkable. The staff was very friendly, helpful and extremely professional. The rooms were very clean and the bed was super comfortable. Thank you for making this a very enjoyable stay. Dear 554sharone,It was our pleasure to have you and I'm glad our team took such good care of your visit. The Hilton Anatole is a quick walk and works well for many so I'm glad you found it to be the case. Thank you for business we look forward to having you back again.Yours in Hospitality,David Weston
0	Slow service, not worth waiting for. We waited for everything and it was never worth it. The resort section is nice for older kids, but not much there for my toddler. Very disappointed with everything: We did not get into our room until well over an hour past check in - and they have a late check in time! If you have trouble walking but do... More
1	Overpriced and over-hyped. Stayed two nights. Felt like they only cater to the rich and famous - that applies mainly to the front desk people and the one female staff member during the Hosted Wine Hour. The housekeeper on my floor, the restaurant gentleman at breakfast, and the valet gentleman were very nice.45.00 per night for valet parking! I realize parking is a premium in Seattle, but Wowie! The only other option is street parking (move it by 8AM) or metered lot across the street. Neither option desirable considering the known car thefts in the area. I hit the restaurant for breakfast only once. Over-priced, fair portions. Friendly gentleman served me. Not many people there at 8:00AM. Ate my protein bar for breakfast the next day instead. The hotel is OLD. The room was updated with modern amenities, including USB ports and plugs for gadgets, flat screen TV, fridge, modern shower fixture, over the sink lighting, free internet.The floor in my room creaked at every step. The room smelled musty. The windows do not block the sound well and one would not latch. Thank goodness for the room darkening curtains and my personal ear plugs! The HVAC was OK - did the job and was not loud. King Sized bed was comfy with lots of pillows. Noisy - The hotel is a couple of blocks from Swedish Hospital and Virginia Mason - hence sirens at various times of the night. Also note it IS in downtown Seattle a few blocks up from I-5.Nice walk in closet. Stocked honor-bar (very pricey! 8.00 for water!) . Save your money, walk 2 blocks up to Bartell Drugs for water and snacks. The bathroom is VERY small. You have to close the door to use the sink. The door will not stay open unless you block it with something. The light from the streets at night are very bright so you have to close the door. Definitely room for only one person. There is no counter space, unless you count the little shelf above the sink. When I mentioned the door at check out, she said we'll check on that. Yeah...right.Dear Neelee, Thank you very much for your honest feedback. At Hotel Sorrento we continue to improve and make upgrades that are meaningful to your Guests, your feedback is being used to prioritize these improvements. I do hope we have the opportunity to welcome you back again in the future so you can have an impeccable stay with us. Sincerely, Shannon Sheron, Managing Director
1	Good hotel and convenient location. Stayed here for a short stay in Chicago - easy for travel as it's no more than a five minute walk from Jackson Station on the blue line from the airport.The hotel is conveniently located for downtown locations - some such as Sears Tower are within easy walking distance while others are no more than a short cab ride or a hop on the blue or red line away.While not huge the room we had was clean, tidy and had everything we needed. The staff were friendly and helpful.My only minor moan would be that we made the booking well in advance and the room rate seemed to be a good bit higher than that quoted on-line by the hotel just before we left.
1	Not what I expected from reviews on Expedia. Location was very convenient, although using their free shuttle to Metro Station probably is not that convenient. We just parked at the station for 4.50/day. If you don't have a car, then I think you could make the shuttle work for you, or take a cab. We booked 2 rooms. Cons: Both were very small, with shabby, 80's looking furnishings. Rooms had an unpleasant musty smell that a/c didn't remedy. One room we booked did not have a fridge and microwave although the hotel lists that as an amenity for their rooms. Ice machine only available on 2nd floor. There isn't one on 4th floor and the one on 3rd floor didn't work. Old-style TV's when almost every other hotel in this category has nicer flat screens. Beds, while somewhat comfortable, were made up with not so great linens (thin sheets, old bedspreads). No laundry room, which is only needed for multi-day stays. Pros: Good housekeeping service swimming pool kept very clean with a lifeguard present at all times, towels are sometimes available at the pool EXCELLENT full hot breakfast available with enough options for daily variety for a multi-day stay. All in all, would probably look a little closer at another Springfield, VA lodging option if visiting in the future. Although most of our time spent in a hotel room is simply sleeping or preparing to go out for the day, would prefer to have just a little more elbow room than this hotel offers.
0	NOT TOTALLY BAD. The heating unit didn't work in the first room I was moved to another room. The dinner menu in the restaurant was mostly sandwiches personally I eat sandwiches for lunch not dinner. I did try the burger one night and the cook cooked every bit of the juice out of the meat I might as well have had some of the desert sand.
1	Braves game. Over all the hotel was great. my only problem was that we were in a room on the ground floor next to the elevator. We could not go to sleep until around 2:00am because every time someone used the elevator we could here it. We even turned the fan to continuous to have some constant noise. Then we got woke up at 6:00am with the elevator again.Dear Mr. Dwayne T, Thank you for staying at the Wingate by Wyndham Atlanta Galleria. We appreciate you sharing your experience with us. Direct feedback from our customers, both good and bad is the most valuable advice we can receive. It helps us to recognize our areas of challenges and make the appropriate adjustments where necessary. The Wingate by Wyndham is definitely looking forward your next visit to Atlanta!Tremeil BooneAssistant Manager
0	Not what I would expect from a Best Western. The hotel is listed as 'ocean front' but there 2 buildings. The second building is across the street from the ocean. That wouldn't be so bad but our room faced out on the old rusting parking structure. You could touch the rusting girders from our door. It was very unpleasant - I wouldn't stay here again. Not at all the standard I would expect from Best Western.
1	Best Deep Dish Pizza. We visited Uno's this past winter. The atmosphere is great, the servers were cutious and very nice people, and the pizza was killer. The manager came out and asked us how we were, this is always a good sign of a well ran restaurant. The waitress took very good care of us, and yes at the time there was not alot of business due to snowfall that day, she did stop to have a conversation with us. The food was excellant, very well garnished and flaverfull, and I can not remember having deep ...view moredish pizza that great! Uno's is one of the best restaurants Peoria, Il has to offer.view less
0	NOT THIS TIME (or next). First the entire floor (2nd) smelled like smoke as if there was a fire. Then the TV didn't work so I went to call the front desk to let them know and the room phone did not work. My husband took a shower and the exhaust fan didn't work. He went to set the alarm clock for a 5 AM... More
0	Nice Hotel - No customer service. My husband and I stayed at the Best Western Plus Arroyo Roble Hotel on Thursday, Feb. 18, 2016, the room was very expensive but we splurged as this was our first time in Sedona. We were given Room 405 which has a beautiful view of the red rock. The problem is that the elevator is right across from the room,... More
1	60th birthday stay. Staff was friendly and professional. Rooms were nice and clean. Pool and jacuzzi was great. Breakfast was delicious. We enjoyed use of the breackfast room for my husband's 60th birthday .Our kids and grandkids where all very comfortable in the suites. Thanks again! Dear Deanne,Thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey regarding your recent stay at our hotel.Your feedback is very important to us and we can assure you that we will use this information to do everything possible to create an enjoyable experience for each of our guests. We hope to see you again soon!Sincerely,Art CollantesGeneral ManagerComfort Suites Mission Valley(619)-881-4000PS: Glad to hear that you were able to enjoy your birthday at our hotel. Feel free to give us a call before your next stay so we can make sure you have the utmost accommodations.
0	They Have Their Own Alcohol Laws. We had a great night out on the town in Charlotte NC and head back to the hotel, go down to grab a beer from the store, and the Manager Michael tells me that this is the Bible Belt, and there are no alcohol sales after Sunday at midnight, and refused to sell me a beer out of the cooler.... More
0	Free Lyme Disease!!. I gave this a 'this room is great for free wifi and sightseeing' review because there wasn't an option for absolutely nothing. We did have wifi, and we got to see a few drug deals in the parking lot, so that could qualify as sightseeing. The room itself was acceptable, the beds were clean, however, they should rethink their free pet policy as our room had ticks, and so we left, after being there two hours. The pictures on hotels.com are NOT pictures of this hotel. The staff was amazing...refunded our money, very apologetic, absolutely outstanding customer service.
0	Pick another hotel. There are several other hotels in the area I would try the others before this one. I would not choose this Travelodge ever again. Service was not great rooms were bad. They even charge for ice. Good luck
1	Anniversary In The City. My wife and I celebrated our 23rd anniversary this past month and decided to stay at the Kensington Park Hotel. The entire staff were extremely accomodating and welcoming. From check-in to check-out we wanted for nothing. The front desk and concierge were very informative on local restaurants and making our reservations. Oh yes, the complimentary bottle of champagne awaiting us in our room with a hand written note from the general manager was a professional touch! If you are looking for a great hotel in the union square area near everything, The Kensington is the place to be!
1	Location, location, location. This hotel is down the street from Bourbon Street and walking distance to the French Quarter. Excellent location. The hotel itself has a peculiar odor throughout - especially in the elevators. I would imagine it was because of the intense humidity outdoors but I'm not sure. The elevators are tiny. Rooms are a decent size. Shower has a rain shower head which is not my favourite but that's just personal preference. Breakfast is typical of free Breakfast hotels. Hot and cold options. I would stay here again for the location.Thank you for your excellent review.The humidity is certainly a factor in everything we do, and can be different. It does take some getting used to, but spending time in New Orleans is worth it!!We are a unique property in a unique location and our goal is to by anything but typical! We will look forward to your return and the opportunity to earn that last star.Sincerely, Stanley Mascair, CHA

1	Good, a little bit far-away. The Westin San Diego is a nice hotel, with pleasant rooms and a good bed ( including pillows).The internet is vey good and nice staff.The bar is too expensive (7 one water).Has a Starbucks for a quick breakfast as well has their own restaurant.If you are planning to go to the congress center you may need to have 15-20 min walk.Mariana G - Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. The Westin Heavenly Bed is the best bed in the industry and we are in the process of replacing all our beds in the hotel. There is nothing better than a heavenly night sleep. I believe you are referring to the Convention Center when referencing the congress center. We are 10 blocks from the center but in San Diego, that is a quick and easy walk. We hope to welcome you back again. Kind Regards, Alyssa TurowskiGeneral Manager
1	Greenwhich Inn. Extremely satisfied with my stay here as we were looking for a place to stay last minute. The room was well worth the price - clean and modern with lots of space. There is free parking available too which is extremely convenient. Ricky at the front desk was very helpful and answered any questions we had. Would definitely stay here again.Thank you for your wonderful feedback - we are thrilled that you had such a wonderful experience with us, and that our hotel was so suitable for your needs and expectations. We appreciate your review, and are delighted that you intend to stay with us again we are very much looking forward to welcoming you back. Best wishes, Hotel Management
0	Less than 1 star!. I booked without checking reviews. My fault. Because they all are accurate ! Bad. The phone in room didn't work there were no light bulbs in any lights. Only over sink and in bathroom. The sheets were clean. The toilet wouldn't flush but discovered why because it runs all the time. Bath tub area had mold in all the seams.... More
1	Short Stay but long memories. This was a short business stay but I really felt at home at the HGI Orlando. We worked at night and needed to relax and rest during the day during our visit. From when I checked in, to my departure I was tired from working but relaxed and refreshed daily after a uninterrupted sleep. . I really want to Thank the staff members who insured I wasen't disturbed: The desk clerk who greeted me with a professional and friendly attitude, she was the same every day, and we talked every day. She really made me feel at home, the individuals who works in the Grill/Bar had an contagious attitudes that made you want to eat then just sit in the area and relax. The cooks who prepared the meals in the Grill, morning and night did a superb job. And last but not least the housekeeping staf fallowed me to sleep and relax during the day but always left me coffee, at my request, daily. When we return to Orlando, I will always stay here if on business or for pleasure. Thanks and Please recognize these staff member for me.Dear Guest Paul C, I would like to thank you on behalf of the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport team for your kind comments on our performance and your experience on your last stay. We want our guests to have the best experience possible where everything exceeds their expectations and we want our guests to be met with a well-trained staff that puts guest comfort and satisfaction before everything else. Thank you for choosing us and your comments we are looking forward to welcome you, family and friends to once again provide you with an outstanding level of service and nothing less. Sincerely,Alex Blanco, General Manager
1	Lovely Hotel in the heart of Seattle. We stayed here for six nights and absolutely loved this hotel. The rooms were quiet and very clean. Really large bed and huge bathroom. We actually extended our stay for another night we enjoyed being in Seattle so much. The hotel itself is ideally situated in the heart of town, just a short walk to Pikes Market and very close to shops and cinemas. We also found the staff very friendly and polite. We dined at the steakhouse and although we were not expecting it, it was fine dining and of course reasonably expensive, but definitely worth it. The steaks were divine! If I came back to Seattle again, I would definitely stay here. We loved it! The only small drawback that we didn't notice until one of our last days was that there was construction across the street. Luckily it didn't keep us awake. All in all I would definitely recommend staying here.

1	Outstanding Customer Service. This hotel is located away from downtown, but can reached with a short taxi ride or the transit system. The rooms were nice and pleasant and very clean! The moment I arrived the staff was very courteous and kind and exceeded all my expectations. I arrived early and my bags were stored in a secure location by the staff so I could explore the city. Staff was very knowledgable about the city and area. The hotel runs a shuttle that runs within a mile of the hotel. The driver of the shuttle was prompt when called for pickups to and from hotel. I requested a late checkout and it was accommodated immediately. I had problems printing my boarding ticket prior to leaving the hotel and the front desk allowed me to e-mail my ticket to them and they printed it for me. I would stay at this hotel again and highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind not being in the heart of downtown and the tourist areas.If you are a light sleeper, request a room away from the street. The hotel is located near a hospital and ambulances go by throughout the night.
0	Leaves a lot to be desired. Had pre-paid for 4 nights, otherwise would have checked out. The room wasn't the cleanest. Bed was soft and uncomfortable. Staff generally nice but not much help with respect to tourism activities other than bus tours. They were busy all of the time we were there, perhaps they need to hire some more people.
0	Try somewhere else. Very disappointed. First of all, I felt taken advantage of. There are few choices in this town and the management knows it. I needed a government rate--you know the rate offered in every other city in the US. Not here. I booked early and still had to pay 40 out of pocket for my stay over and above my allotment... More
1	3 nights in Seattle. Very friendly and service minded staff. Hotel is nice and modern, located only 10 minutes away from the popular fish market. Had a great stay here. Our drawbacks are minor, but iron and iron board was in very bad condition (hardly usable), water seemed too soft, low water pressure in the shower, and a USD 68/night valet brought it down from 5 to 4 for us.Hello HoustonAndre, thank you so much for your review on your recent stay at W Seattle. We are thrilled that you had a great time, and enjoyed the hotel. Thanks for sharing your feedback on the valet prices and the iron...my apologies that we missed the mark on those things for you! I do hope that we will see you back at the hotel next time! Thanks again!
1	Good for a night. We just stayed here one night on a birthday trip to Napa. My friend picked this place to stay and for the it was nice. A little more upgraded than most Best Westerns. Bed was comfy, sink area a little small but not a deal breaker. Had microwave and iron in room which I appreciate.They do give you a discount coupon for the attached Denny's Restaurant. Skip if you can, not really worth it.Next time I would stay closer to Napa itself but for a night, this place was just fine.Thank you for your review and we are glad you enjoyed your stay.
1	J.W. Marriott Buckhead is terrific. The people throughout the hotel are very friendly. The rooms are a step above a regular Marriott. This property is connected to the Lenox Mall which is something to do on a rainy afternoon.The bed was comfortable and the TV is a decent size.All in all, a very good place to stay in Buckhead.Dear AndrewLNewYork,Thank you for sharing about your stay at JW Marriott Atlanta Buckhead. We appreciate the kind remarks and are glad you could discover the timeless elegance of our hotel, located in the heart of Atlanta's vibrant business, shopping and entertainment district. We hope to see you again soon!Eb MbyeDirector of Operations
1	weekend getaway. I can't say enough good things about this hotel. This was our second trip to Chicago, but our first at The River Hotel. The room was small, but the dcor and the view made up for it. The staff was very friendly, not a single person passed us without saying hello and asking us how we were. The concierge desk was fantastic! Tim was amazing, his recommendations were spot on, he helped us with directions, whether it was taking the train, a bus or walking. It was refreshing to have the help when you are travelling. Roman was also very helpful. We will definitely be staying here again.
0	No hot water, no cell reception. When we told the front desk about the lack of hot water they said they'd known and were working on it. We didn't have much hot water in our two days. No cell reception in center rooms. No natural light - if we opened our shades we were looking directly into our neighbors' bedroom. It's really too bad as the staff is friendly and the rooms are spacious. You can't beat the location. They offer complimentary shuttle service within a mile, which is helpful, and a cooked breakfast but the eggs are disgusting.
1	Good and not so good. There are many good things about this hotel. The staff was very welcoming, friendly, and helpful the gardens are beautiful the pool with the bar service is nice and we had no complaints about the food in Adobe and the wine bar. The room was spacious enough and the bathroom was nice, with plenty of towels (one of my pet peeves is a hotel that gives you only 2-3 towels per room to start). A nice place for sure. The only real issue is that the hotel is located far away from San Diego and even downtown La Jolla--a 40 dollar and 20 dollar cab ride, to be more specific--so I'm not sure I would recommend this as a vacation hotel unless you had a rental car and didn't mind driving everywhere. Of course, this is my fault for not researching San Diego very well beforehand, so I can't downgrade the hotel much for that in fact, if I lived in the area, I might certainly book a room here if I wanted to get away from the city for a few days.
0	Needs improvement. My daughter and I checked in late after driving all day. The room we were originally set to be in was marked as not ready in the system, so we were assigned to a larger room. When we got into the room, overall, everything appeared to be clean. However, when we went to the bathroom to turn on the shower, we noticed that the shower/tub had not been cleaned (or if it had, it was not done well). There were several dark hairs still in the bathtub, as well as small stumbles from a man. This was quite disgusting and not what we wanted to deal with at the late hour. I did my best to wash out and wipe down the tub, but we quickly showered with our flip flops on and went to bed. In the morning, we woke up and checked out quickly because it just felt dirty in the room. I did let the clerk know about our room upon checkout, and she stated that she would let the head of cleaning know.
1	Great stay at Ocean Park Inn. We stayed here in August 2012 - clean rooms, right on the beach, comfortable bed. We were upgraded on arrival and had a great room facing the ocean. Location is excellent, walking distance to many restaurants, beach, shopping, and grocery store. Small fridge in the room was a bonus. Staff were very friendly. Beach was great right out front of the hotel, with life guard startion right there. Pool was great to have and protected from wind. Breakfast is one of the best hotel breakfasts we had on our 2 week trip and even has a waffle maker!We definitely recommend this hotel and would stay there again. Some reviewers complain about the noise, but that is because there are a number of restaurants and pubs nearby - we were not bothered by their proximity.Thank you for the kind review! We're happy to hear you enjoyed the property and our location. Being within walking distance of the beach and restaurants/shopping really has its advantages! We hope to see you again in the future!
0	Don't accept a smoking room.... Asked for poolside room, non smoking... they gave me and my kids, two of whom have asthma, a smoking room. We were also charged 20 more than the previous stay for a much worse room. The room was clean but smelled terrible. The entire hallway smelled bad but the room was much worse. We will not be back. My advice... More
0	SLEEPER BEWARE!!. This was the WORST hotel experience I have ever experienced in my 47 years walking the face of this Earth. The hotel room was egregiously small, the beds were sunken in the middle, the pillow cases, linens, bed spreads and blankets were all filthy, the room had the stench of heavy cigarette smoke, the front desk LIED to me about not having any other rooms available and, to top it off, they still charged my credit card for a two-night stay despite me not even staying 15 minutes. I told the front desk that I was not staying and found somewhere else to stay and they told me that I would not give a refund despite the horrible and horrific conditions mentioned above. Lousy customer service. I would NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone except the police. And, I would only recommend it to the police in order for them to arrest and file charges against hotel staff for theft -- for charging my credit card when I did not even stay at the hotel.
1	Good enough. We stayed in a small queen room for 2 nights. The room is small, but comfortable. I will say, however, that the bed is on the hard side and not the most comfortable. The sheets have a papery feel to them as well. But the pillows are fluffy. Not the typical hotel bed where you feel like you're sleeping on clouds, but it does the trick, I suppose. Still, all in all, the staff is friendly and the location is really convenient if you'll be spending time downtown. The room is quiet and the wifi is free. It's also affordable. Based on that, I recommend it.Dear Ann C,Thank you for your recommendation! We sincerely appreciate you taking the time to provide feedback about your recent experience.We look forward to welcoming you back in the future.
0	Bad area, wouldn't go back. Went down for breakfast and there was none left. What they did have was terrible. Comforter on bed was dirty.
1	Great Hotel. We stayed at this hotel as a stop over point on our family vacation to Door County Wisconsin. The hotel was easy to find and our front desk check-in process was quick and easy. The staff is very friendly and helpful! We booked with a package from Marriot that included parking and a 3 day transit pass. If you plan to go downtown it is a little bit of a long train ride but much easier than driving there! The rooms were clean and comfortable. They are a little small but you never feel cramped. The pool area is beautiful and room was on the ground floor with direct access. I would highly reccomend this hotel for pleasure or business!
1	Great deal for double room with kitchenette. I originally booked a queen room but was surprised to see there were two double beds was no issue at all given the extra bed was good for space and to add I wasn't expecting a kitchenette in the room. Could have been some more toiletries and maybe cook ware and silverware but good to know next time what to bring. Front desk staff very cool and even with us waking up late and checking out a half hour after the set time there was no issue at all no one bothers about it given we did check in late. Very appreciated.
1	UNIQUE hotel,but more amenities required. we enjoyed the hotel but it needs more amenities-they were building a new cafe-but there was no bar /gym/breakfast-which is a pity as it is a great building which they have improved.the room was good sized and clean.however the price is way too high for what you receive.Dear tigerdw,We certainly appreciate your feedback about your recent stay with us and are pleased that you enjoyed our hotel. Indeed, you are right, we are currently building a new cafe and wine bar, which will set to open this Fall. In addition, our new fitness center and business center will be open then as well. We hope to welcome you back on your next visit to San Francisco!Best regards,NickHaiyi Hotels San Franciscofor Hotel Vertigo
0	Nice Hotel but Poor Customer Service. I have written almost 150 reviews on Trip Advisor almost all of which were rated Very Good or Excellent. I am not a chronic complainer, but this is one of my rare negative reviews.I stayed at the Best Western Hacienda Old Town for 2 nights on November 8th and 9th. My stay started out very positive, but ended on a negative note.First, the positives:Its a great location is the heart of Old Town San Diego. The hotel has a great restaurant on site Old Town Tequila Factory which I rated favorably. Dozens of other restaurants and shops are within a short walk.The Old Town Transit Center is also a few blocks away. There, you can hop on the Trolley to go to Downtown, Qualcomm Stadium and the Mission Valley shopping malls.The negatives:This location charges for parking -- 15 per day (10 for AAA members). This is also one of the few Best Westerns which doesnt offer a free breakfast (AAA members get a 25 discount off their breakfast buffet).My biggest complaint is that I didnt receive any housekeeping service on Monday. When I complained to the Front Desk on Tuesday, they made matters worse.I was traveling on vacation and wanted to sleep later on Monday morning, so I put out my Do Not Disturb sign. I removed the DND sign at 10am Monday when I left for the day. I returned to my room after the football game at 10:30pm to discover that my room was never cleaned.When I mentioned this Tuesday morning, the Front Desk clerk turned the problem around and basically said that it was MY fault that my room wasnt cleaned. I should have called Housekeeping to request service.I have worked in a hotel for 25 years, so I know thats not the way it works. If there is a DND on the door in the morning, Housekeeping returns after lunch to recheck the room. Clearly, this wasnt done.I am not the type of guest who expects a free stay for any minor problem, but I do think it would be appropriate to receive some compensation for my inconvenience of returning to a dirty room.The price I paid for the room includes the cost of providing housekeeping services. If the hotel fails to provide a promised service, they should not charge for it.I have requested that the hotel issue me a refund for the 20 parking fees which would be 10 discount off my total bill. I think that this would be fair and appropriate amount for returning to a dirty room.The Front Desk Manager has admitted that they made a mistake, but the hotel is refusing to issue a refund or any form of compensation for my inconvenience. In light of this poor customer service, I have given the hotel a Poor rating.Thank you for your feedback. As a result of your review, we have revisited our procedures in order to make the changes needed. I apologize for the housekeeping oversight. Please feel free to reach out to me directly if another stay in Old Town is on your agenda so that I can assign a team member to personalize your experience. Happy Holidays!
1	My Weekend At Best Western Orlando East Inn Suites. I am currently a resident of Louisiana, and I am enrolled in graduate school at Asbury Theological Seminary in Orlando, Florida / Wilmore, Kentucky (2 campuses). I have been coming to Orlando about 4 - 6 times a year for on-campus classes, and I have always stayed at this particular Best Western on East Colonial Drive. This hotel has been perfect for my commute and the accommodations are exactly what I need. The staff are not only friendly but very helpful, and this has been consistent for the last year or two that I have been coming. With this particular visit, the hotel had recently upgraded their internet services but since my computer is aging I was having trouble getting it to work properly. One of the maintenance techs Joel Baez helped me troubleshoot it for a good 30 minutes before we threw in the towel on the wireless and he provided me with an ethernet cable. Problem solved and I'm back online! Thanks Joel B.! Thanks Best Western for always being there when I needed you to be!Sincerely,Stephen HebertThank you very much for giving us feedback regarding your recent stay with us at the Best Western East Inn Suites! We are ecstatic to know that you have been staying with us for some time, and each time your stay was met to your satisfaction. We are sorry if you had trouble with the internet, but it was great That Joel was able to stop by to help you with the issue. We are always working hard to maintain satisfaction for our guests, and we will be sure to acknowledge Joel at our next meeting for assisting you to maintain your satisfaction with your stay. We always enjoy having you as a guest, and we do hope to see you again at our establishment soon.
0	There is better for next door for your money. The front desk staff is unfriendly, they don't greet you or say thank you. The housekeeping is the only polite staff they are AWESOME. The breakfast is not all that great. Rooms have a smell to them.
0	Leaking Windows!. We stayed here for the Flying Pig Marathon Weekend. The hotel location is great, but the room had issues. The windows leaked terribly and we had a rain storm. The carpet was sopping wet for two feet out from the windows. The smoke detector was dangling off the wall by the wires. The staff was very friendly, though. Bright spot... More
1	2nd time around, same great stay, same great service!!!!. Well, they did it again. After a stay at this hotel back in August and the absolutely fabulous service from Erin Loughlin, I kept my promise of never staying anywhere else when I visit Chicago. And, because I love the great city of Chicago, I had to go back. This time, I had no question where my lodging would be as I trekked to and fro across the city streets. I LOVE the personal service. I have told so many people about my great experiences and I hope they choose to patronize this great hotel, too. Like Arnold Schwarzenegger said, I'll be back!
1	Loved this property. I love the Best Western Plus product. The rooms are always big and clean.This is my first visit to Napa, the area is beautiful. I picked this locating using my airline discount site which posted good reviews as well.The staff are very friendly and accommodating. We received a 3rd floor room above the lobby which afforded us a great view. Even though our balcony overlooked the road, we never heard any traffic noises. There is plenty of shopping and food options right across the street.We drove to downtown Napa and found plenty of great option for shopping and dining as well. I recommend going down there for good local flavor. I would discourage using your phone as your GPS to get around to various vineyards, we had two different maps going but kept losing our signal. Either bring your Garmen, etc. or ask the rental car agency for one just in case.Thank you for your detailed review and we are glad you enjoyed your stay.
1	Charming and convenient. The Broome is a well-situated, warm and welcoming boutique hotel in the heart of Soho. The rooms are sizable and airy, the staff friendly and knowledgeable and the location superb. My daughter and I had a wonderful time and will definitely return.Dear Bethshorstein:Thank you again for choosing to stay with us at The Broome SoHo NYC and thank you for taking the time to share with us. We really appreciate your feedback and it was a joy having you and your daughter with us. We really hope to get to see you again soon. Until then, if you need anything at all, please do not hesitate to contact us at infothebroomenyc.com.
1	A Lot to Like. Frankly, I reserved this hotel because it was the cheapest decent property I could find in downtown Seattle. So I wasn't expecting much when we checked in. We were pleasantly surprised. The rooms are small and the building is old, but they've done a good job of making the best of it. I've seen it described as quaint and that's a fair description. It has the look and feel of an old classic place. It's clean and well-maintained, and they've done a good job of updating the necessary amenities. They also have a sister property across the street with which they share facilities (ie. laundry). It's nothing special, and yet it is. They have a good (albeit expensive) restaurant in the lobby, which means breakfast is pricey, but there's a decent place a block away called Corner Caf. The only thing I really missed is a fridge and microwave.Hello Traveler - Thank you for your review. We are please to hear that you were pleasantly surprised by your stay with us (we do that to our guests all the time!). We hope you'll stay with us again when your travels bring you back to the Emerald City!
1	Miami Airport Stay. Staff was very helpful and helped me with directions around the area. The food from the restaurant was very good. Great for business but also a lot of amenities for Families too. Close to the MIA and interstates for easy access!Thank you for taking a moment to share your experience. We are happy to hear that your stay was a great one and that you were treated as deserved. Our entire hotel staff enjoyed catering to your needs. We look forward to welcoming you back to our hotel in the future. At Hilton Garden Inn, we promise to do whatever it takes to ensure you are satisfied. You Can Count On Us. Guaranteed
1	VERY COMFORTABLE BED PILLOWS. We stayed here for only 1 night. The bed Pillows--AWESOME!!!! It is so hard to stay at a hotel find comfort w/these 2 items--especially pillows--these were GREAT!!! The breakfast was really good--lots of variety. The room bathroom were clean. The bathroom size was small--but ok for a night. WE had the (2) Queen bed room. The hotel staff was very helpful, friendly, professional. We would stay again!Hello,Thank you so much for taking the time to write the review of your stay here.

1	Location is the best!. Stayed at the OPI during Spring Break March '15. This hotel is right on Pacific Beach and is in the heart of all the action. LOts of close by restaurants and drinking available within walking distance. The rooms could use some updating and the hallways definitely need some sprucing up. Our room had a nicely updated bathroom with large walk in shower. The exterior of the hotel is very nice and updated along with a new pool/hot tub area. All new sun loungers around the pool with umbrellas for some shade. They also have a large wicker trunk of beach toys available for kids to take to the beach so no need to buy any.The breakfast items were limited but very handy before heading out for a day full off activity. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. They had great recommendations for restaurants and local activities.Overall a great place to stay while in San Diego.Walter, thank you for taking the time to provide us with a helpful review. We are very pleased to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us. furthermore, we are glad that you were able to enjoy some of the great attractions that Pacific Beach has to offer. From excellent local restaurants, to craft beers at nearby bars, to spending the day at the beach, there is something for the whole family to enjoy. Thank you for acknowledging our recently renovated bath rooms and pool furniture, we make a conscious effort to upgrade various parts of the hotel throughout the year and we hope to see you back again soon so you can see some of our newer renovations.
1	Great location, very nice hotel, pricey. My son was attending the PAX convention and has stayed at this hotel before. Great location for everything. Staff were overall great and helped us with a broken handle on our luggage. The only issue I have is why hotels in general only provide towels for two guests in a room that sleeps four We had asked for early booking, but the room was not ready. After a long flight I chose to wait in the lobby and it was awfully cold. My husband and son had left to attend a baseball game. When I got to the room after a two-hour wait, I then had to call down to get extra towels, as I knew there were not enough for all of us. We had a view of the space needle which was great. We were very pleased to find the mini-bar was empty and we could stock up the fridge with refreshments. At over 350.00/night with all the fees/taxes, it was pricey. There was a caf accessible from the hotel and we made a lot of use of it for a quick breakfast before heading out to see the sights. Overall it was really good, but expensive.
1	Direct Access to Lenox Mall - Shop till you Drop. If shopping is your thing Lenox Mall (or Phipps Plaza across the street), offers some of the best high end shopping in the Southeast. We moved from Atlanta to South Florida twenty years ago. We are very familiar with the area and where looking for a place where our adult children could meet up with us before driving father north for the holidays. There is a Marta Station (Lenox) directly across the street from the hotel. When coming from the Airport make sure to take the train marked Doraville. Parking is expensive 20/day if you do not use the valet. We booked using a general hotel web site hours before our arrival and got and excellent rate. It may be possible to do even better if you call the hotel direct. Like all Marriott hotels the service and accommodations were excellent. We stayed during the holiday week so traffic was light. I like most people still complain about the internet charges. We just used our own data. There are numerous great restaurants within walking distance or a short taxi ride from the hotel. There is a quick breakfast cafe servicing the office crowd in the shared office tower.
0	First Impression - Panic. When I first saw this motor inn, I thought there was now way I was staying at this place even though I had made reservations in advance. It needs a lot of repairs or maybe just rebuild the whole place. Everything looked very old and run down. The room itself was clean and comfortable and had all the necessary conveniences.... More
1	Very Good Value and Location. We were very pleasantly surprised when we stayed here for 2 nights prior to sailing on the Carnival Fantasy. We booked 2 rooms at around 65/night each, which included a nightly happy hour and an above-average breakfast buffet (with decent scrambled eggs, waffle machine, etc).This is an older property which has been renovated very nicely. The rooms are small but functional. Everything was quite clean and staff was courteous and efficient (except for recommending dinner at Mulate's - see separate review).We were less than a 10-minute walk from the Vieux Carre, which we walked to and from several times, never feeling unsafe or nervous for a single moment.To be so close to downtown, yet in a safe location, and get decent accommodations for a modest price in a very expensive city, the Drury is an outstanding value. We would definitely stay there again.
0	Beware!. Something is seriously wrong with the hotel in this casino! Customer service in the casino is outstanding in the hotel not so much. Left our room at 8am to go to the Grand Canyon for the day. Upon returning at 9pm that night found our hotel room door open with the lock holding the door open! Checked the room and it appeared everything was still intact. Talk to the night supervisor at the front desk about it. She told us there was nothing she could do about it and she would call security. Security met us at our room. Talked to us, checked the room and they decided it was no big deal as nothing was missing! So I guess they think it's ok for your room to be open when you are not there! And for at least 8 hrs too. They treated us like we were scamming them or something. Talked to casino night supervisor about it and finally got someone who actually cared. But could give us no answers until she talked to the casino manager.Casino manager finally called next day and said she would comp our room for one night. Well to make this long story short, night was not comped ended up paying for our full 4 nights! I asked to talk to the casino manger again but was told they would not be in until noon. I will never stay in this hotel again nor will I gamble here either. If you stay here lock all your valuables up in the safe. And be prepared for terrible customer service if anything does go wrong. Casino manager did call back later in the day and did comp two nights but I find the actions of the front desk supervisor as well as the security people unacceptable! Also every one acted like it was not a big deal. Maybe they should have someone leave their front doors open all day and see how they feel about that!Thank you for taking the time to post your comments. We apologize for any inconveniences you experienced during your stay. Please be assured that finding your room open is of great concern, and we have advised all appropriate departments of your specific situation. At no time did we think you were scamming or something of that nature. While we can understand your frustrations, please understand there are policies and procedures to be followed in a situation like this. We hope you enjoyed the rest of your trip, the Grand Canyon must have been amazing to see in person!
1	Great night away. I have been taking my husband downtown as a Christmas Present for the past few years. We have been trying new hotels on each stay. We have been trying all the Kimpton hotels in Chicago and this year we tried the Hotel Allegro. Hotel Allegro has a beautiful art deco theme, rooms are not large but it is downtown Chicago and the space is used effectively. We knew the secret password that got us a couple of free drinks at the bar. The hotel, like the other Kimpton Hotels offers a cocktail hour where they served sparkling wine and spiked hot chocolate. The spiked hot chocolate was super yummy, went back for a mugful the little tasting glass they gave was not going to cut it. Beds were comfy, shower had great pressure. I would stay and reccomend the hotel. If you take the time you can find all sorts of sitting areas to hang out in. Coffee Hot Chocolate bar in the morning. Check out the various packages they have, we got the room and valet parking rate for 160 on a Saturday night.Hello!Thank you for the wonderful review! It looks like you've hit it all! Thanks for staying with us and surprising your husband for Christmas! We're so happy to hear that you enjoyed the spiked hot chocolate! It's perfect for this time of year! We hope to see you and your husband soon!kimptonlove babyitscoldoutsideRachel RodriguezGuest Experience Manager
1	Nice hotel. Fantastic hotel with great rooms! Service was good, rooms were clean. The only downside - our room was overlooking the rooftop of a local nightclub so we fell asleep listening to the loud bass from the music. Otherwise great place and would go back again.Dear Mtxstarr,Glad you joined us, although I apologize for the lively neighborhood! There's not too many challenges that arise from a city with such amazing weather, but one of them is that a lot of the bars and restaurants in the Gaslamp are outdoor. That can lead to some issues with noise from time to time! One great room tip ask for a higher room overlooking the East Village (also known as the Ballpark District). There's less noise emanating from the local clubs there. Hope that helps and please come see us again.RobertGeneral ManagerHotel Solamar - a very Kimpton Hotel
1	A real gem. What a find! The orchard Garden is well located - not far from Union Square and almost next door to China Gate. We were welcomed warmly and given a lovely room on the 7th floor overlooking the Bush Street. The staff were so friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. We had breakfast there every day over our 3 day stay and it was plentiful. freshly cooked and good value for money. Our room was spacious, clean and the bed really comfy. Housekeeping did an excellent job in looking after us. The only minor wrinkle was low water pressure in the shower. We would definitely recommend the Orchard Garden without hesitation. Thank you all for a wonderful stay.What a wonderful dose of encouragement, Sue! I'm so happy to hear that you felt very welcome and well taken care of with us. I hope that anytime you're traveling back to San Francisco, we'll be lucky enough to host you again!Take care, Collins C., Front Office Manager
0	location and staff were great! Room, not so much. Trash.... location and staff were great! Room, not so much. Trash wasnt emptied, hair in tub and top comforter on one bed didnt look to clean. Price and location were main reason for chosing this place -again staff and breakfast were nice
0	Wish I could give them negative stars!!!. My family found our way to Hyatt Valencia as a result of a catastrophic Gas Well blow-out. Governor Brown declared a state of emergency and more than 4,400 people from my community were relocated to hotels. It was our misfortune to wind up at the Hyatt Regency Valencia. They took FULL ADVANTAGE of the situation, of us, and even the... More
0	Lost Reservation. We arrived for our first family vacation only to find out they lost our reservation. I had the print out of our hotel confirmation but that made no difference. Staff was friendly but not helpful in finding us new accomodations.
0	bad. I was verry disAppointed. With the house keeping service, no towels, bed wasn't done cause we left a a pant on the bed, no cofffe......i hated.....i hate to ask for everything when is suppose to be done w out asking
0	Traffic noise easily heard from hotel. We have a 3rd floor room Mountain Side View facing Ala Wai Blvd. The Blvd. Creates noise constantly 24/7 with loud music, loud motorcycles and cars because it is a very busy street. The noise easily filters into the hotel room. Sleep may be elusive for travelers that need quiet for sleep. It is possible that a room on a... More
1	Upscale Hotel close to everything. The Troubadour is a hotel that is clearly run by seasoned professionals. It is modern and beautifully appointed. The staff is friendly and welcoming. The room was spacious, the bed incredibly comfortable , the bathroom had every amenity and the largest and nicest shower imaginable. The rooftop bar was lively, had a great view, drinks and DJ. It is a short walk to the French Quarter. Do not hesitate to stay there!Thank you for taking time to complete a review of your recent stay. I'm thrilled to hear you had an enjoyable stay. We know you have a lot of choices when selecting a place to stay and appreciate having had the opportunity to impress you. Thank you for the recognition and recommendation, we look forward to seeing you again soon.WayneGeneral Manager
0	Sorry, but we will not be back!. Positives...The location was right across from the beach. The view from the balcony was amazing! The staff was very nice and friendly. The manager worked very hard and was there all the time. I was worried that she never got to see her family since she was ALWAYS there. She really needs more help. The maintenance man and the cleaning... More
0	Dirty bathroom and rude staff. The woman who checked us in upon our arrival was incredibly rude and immediately put a damper on stay. I'm not sure if we were given a handicapped room or if they are all similar, but the bathroom didn't have a tub and was absolutely disgusting. It was one big room with a drain in the floor and did not appear to have been cleaned in some time. One corner appeared to have blood. At 5 a.m. A group of workers with coolers stood at the end of the other hallway from us and we're speaking so loudly for over 10 minutes it woke up my husband, my infant, and I. As my in laws have recently moved to the area I expect we will be visiting Tracy frequently but I will NEVER again stay at this hotel.
0	Ripped off. The girlfriend and I decided to take a trip to Salem mass for Halloween and upon checking Expedia found this hotel listed as 103 for 2 nights with only 1 room left available. Shocked at this amazing deal we booked immediately. When we arrived and tried to check in we were informed that we owed 230. I was outraged and demanded to talk to a manager who wasn't there. We ended up settling to stay only 1 night which was over 100 and then make our way to Salem the next morning after having breakfast and find somewhere else. We wake up the next morning to find out there isn't even a free breakfast! Very unhappy with this stay and will never go to this hotel or the franchise again!!!!
1	Decent hotel at a decent price.. For being located in the city of D. C. the price was reasonable. My biggest complaint was that I booked ahead of time through Expedia and paid using my credit card. When I arrived I noticed that they gave AAA members a discount and asked if I can get the discount being that I am a member. Of course, they said sorry but you already paid for the room and there is nothing we can do about it. Gotta love it when computers tie the hands of people from being able to do what's right. I should have been able to receive this discount but, the computers would not allow it. This is wrong. In the past before modern technology they would have done this. While all this was happening there was a gentlemen next to me that complained about a price variance due to not receiving a AAA discount and the staff did an over-ride for him because he did not pay yet. I'm not sure I can use services such as Expedia again if this is the result. I hate feeling ripped off and I definitely was in this case so no more Expedia for me unless I get my discount back.
1	Beyond expectations!. We had a wonderful time. We planned this stay as a Christmas gift to our children, 7 and 8 yr olds tk watch their first Colts game.I was so happy to not have to walk outside to get to the stadium s ok we didn't have to pack their winter coats all day. We had dinner right down stairs at TGI Fridays and walked to the mall the night before.parking was easy and worth the money to know that my car was ok until after the game. We will definitely be staying again for games and just family time.
0	Horrible!!!. Not worth the price and the room is the size of a closet, and just horrible maintenance, dents on the doors, Motel 6 would of been better. Don't ever ever stay there!!! And the front desk is no help you have to goto the bar to get ice in your ice bucket
0	You pay for what you get. If you're on an extreme budget then stay! Or just for one night!!! But, I'd pay the extra money and stay at the Marriott otherwise... It wasn't that clean: the carpet, walls, the place needs up grading
0	Angry in Atlanta. bad experience front desk clerk messed up my credit card, housekeeping ignored us and forced us to the side in the elevator while the equipment took up all of the space when they could have waited, we had a large roach in our room. bad experience!!!!Dear Guest,We apologize that you did not have a great stay with us. It is our goal to ensure that our guests have a great stay with us. We pride ourselves on getting it right for all of our guests and apologize that we did not during your stay with us. Thank you for letting us know and for sharing your comments. We will be sure to utilize your comments in our team meetings to further training in needed areas. We know that you have many choices to stay and we appreciate that you chose to stay with us. We hope to see you again soon.Sincerely, Patricia Kilgore
0	Poor experience, but the place was okay. We stayed recently at the beginning of August. It was clean I will given them that. But, they say there is a shuttle to Disneyland but it is 5 a person. I feel that is costly. It was better for the four of us to...MoreThank you for staying with us and apologize that you were miss informed in regards to the shuttle as it is a city provided service we have no say in the rates that they charge our guests. We just cut down the time frame it...More
0	Had potential. I stayed here with my family and the facility is outdated, the entrance smelled horrible. They didn't have an HDMI port for the tv, no extra comforters, the beds were a little uncomfortable
1	I would make this my home.. We stayed here for the weekend and it was great. The hotel must have been recently upgraded, because it did not look old and ran down to me. The front desk clerk asked my son what floor he wanted to stay on, which is cool that she included him. He chose the top floor, which I always recommend. We stayed in a room facing Hardwood street, even with construction, it was still quiet.The breakfast was good and they had a pretty good variety.They have a parking garage, so you can protect your vehicle from the weather. I am not a fan of public pools, but this was clean and I did not hesitate to get in.The location is not the best, but it is very close to public transportation. I go to Dallas often and I will stay here again.
0	terrible. not good
1	Nice hotel, convenient to BWI. We booked in here due to an early morning flight. It was a little more expensive than what we usually pay for when staying at a hotel but it was definitely worth it. Very lovely clean room, and the staff were very helpful and polite. The only downside was (upon checking out) the early morning shuttle driver was running a little late, and due to the amount of people and luggage, was stressed and became rude when trying to squeeze the last few people on the shuttle......however the shuttle driver the day before was very friendly and helpful so it all evened itself out.
0	TIME BETTER SPENT SOMEWHERE ELSE.... Well trip was booked without looking here first. Figured ok well we will go and see how it is thinking it is only to sleep and rest. Got to room and lights didnt work, patio door was a nightmare to open. to mini frig, very poor service in diner, room was almost alive with smells and dirt. We stayed from Sun to Wed. now the diner service was very bad but had 30 daily for food and was not going to let it go to waste. But the wait was long and slow. Staff seemed to be more interested in texting or smoking or anything but service. Housekeeping seemed to be doing best they could with available supplies. Seen floor cleaner sitting in hall on 1st floor for almost 24 hours. The bed itself was not to bad. Always go on trips with my own pillows as i hate the ones in hotels. Internet was worse than dial up. Truck came out of valet with dings on rear on both sides. not a good time dealing with all the small issues. next time more money to go to maybe ocean city n.j. or wildwood. not into casinos so that was not reason to go there. grrrrr what a waste...
0	Roach coach. Checked in and checked right back out has no hot water and had roaches crawling on the bed would not ever stay there the people there are very rude and very nasty and the manger lady pick up the roach bare handed and tossed it out Side and then wipe her nose with that same hand
0	Dirty, Unfriendly Staff!!!. I booked this through Expedia and prepaid so we had no choice but to stay. I read reviews beforehand and it seemed ok and reasonably priced for a best Western. When we arrived the hotel looked old and very outdated, nothing like reviews. The guy that checked us in was not very friendly. We were in a room on second... More
1	Very easy access to historic sights and shopping. We loved the hotel. We came for the Kansas City Marathon, and found the hotel centrally located for everything. We had no reason to even get into our car to go out, except for our friends wanted to go to a restaurant that was not near by. Had we chosen what restaurant we would have just stayed at the hotel and ate there. We did the Link, and went to the Crown Shopping Center it was pretty awesome. We also walked through Washington Park to go to Union Station. It was a beautiful hotel, and we loved the view from our room on the 38th floor. We also loved the hotel was so close to the Marathon event. We definitely will return, and stay at this hotel again.
1	Excellent, quite and great location!. The chicago Marriott across Ashland ave.t at Med District/UIC is a gem. Almost has the feel of a boutique hotel. Stylish and roomy, the excellent staff makes you feel right at home. Located in the near West, the hotel has a great location to take advantage of everything the downtown area has to offer. Best part, it is very reasonable for the quality making it worth it to cab or Uber to wherever you want to go. Take advantage of the 13.50 overnight parking in the Rush hospital location just across Ashland Ave and an easy walk.
1	City Chique. What a great hotel! The decor and architecture is an exceptional mix of modern and vintage. The location was perfect for catching a show, as it is in Chicago's theater district. Our room was comfortable, although the bathroom was very small. They brought a Keurig to the room upon request. I cannot say enough about the porters/greeters/concierge - they were classy and helpful and kind.Friendly and comfortable is what we aim for and we're so proud of our team! The rooms are a bit cozy, which is what you get in a historic 1920's building along with the charm! Come back soon!Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager
1	Great place to stay. Fantastic hot breakfast included.. We will use this hotel again. Great location. Right off freeway. All places we wanted to go were within 5 miles. Comfy bed. I thought pillows too flat (soft), but still slept well. While we were there it was pretty quiet. Our room faced a hotel that is being dismantled. My husband was awakened once by noise that was from there, but it was only for a few minutes. I wasn't disturbed by it. I would suggest asking for a room that did not face that way, especially if you are a light sleeper. The hotel and our room quite clean. From the reviews I read, I think the hotel is less than 2 years old. They have free wifi. Parking is 16 a day/night. There was plenty of parking. We stayed 8/23-8/26 (Sun-Thurs). During busier weekends or holidays not sure of parking situation or how quiet it would be. The breakfast is fantastic and staff kept all items stocked to 10am when the doors were closed. Many choices. Examples: Scrabbles eggs, sausage links, sausage patties, ham, gravy, biscuits, omelets, home style brkfst potatoes/hash brown dish, oatmeal, hard boiled eggs, variety of fruit, muffins, bagels and breads (toast it yourself), make your own waffles, 4-5 different dry cereals, variety of yogurt cups, variety of coffee, tea, oj, apple juice, milk. Variety of jellies, cream cheese, creamers, sweeteners, peanut butter, honey, syrup, butter, margarine, etc. Every day we were there all the hot items were different. The hot egg, meat, potato dishes listed above were not all one day. There were four different items daily of the eggs, meat, and potato dishes. I figured at least 10-15 per person savings if we had to buy breakfast somewhere. All hotel staff very friendly and helpful. I highly recommend the Old Town Trolley Tour. Check out all details on line. According to information, the trolley picks up at the hotel. We did not get that early of a start to be picked up at the hotel. Not sure when or where return would be for the trolley. For the times and things we did, it worked out better for us to park at Midway and get on trolley at that location.Dear Pam O,Thank you for your 5-star review. We were thrilled to read that you enjoyed our central location and the great attractions that surround us. Additionally, we graciously appreciate you recognizing our friendly and helpful team. As for your description of your breakfast experience, the only word that comes to mind is wow. Thank you for painting such an amazing picture, our breakfast team was ecstatic. I cannot begin to describe the smiles you brought to their faces when they read your review thank you very much for making their day that much better!Last, but certainly not least, thank you for leaving a traveler tip. While we work to create world class experiences every day for our loyal guests, nobody lives the experience quite like you, our guests. Thank you for helping us make our future guests stays exceptional!Warm Regards,Nathan S.Operations Manager
1	Newer hotel offers comfy beds and spacious rooms. The Troubadour is a couple blocks outside the Quarter which is ideal for driving in and out while there's parades happening. The studio room we had was spacious and comfortable. Nice big shower his and her vanity. Though it had somewhat unsettling, disturbing artwork on the walls. The rooftop bar has a great view of the city but it's sadly not accessible 24/7 but only from 5 pm till last call. They should change that as I'm sure it would be equally enjoyable during the day. The drinks are extremely overpRiced. You're better off bringing your own drinks. I also would've liked to see a pool and whirlpool there but there wasn't. The restaurant had delicious breakfast and pastries and the servers were friendly and accommodating. A couple cons: The carpets in the room looked like they hadn't been vacuumed in awhile and a couple days they didn't stock enough towels or tissue. Also be careful to not leave valuables out, even food. We left some freshly boxed muffins on the desk that we intended to eat later but found they had been taken when we returned to the room hours later. The elevators kept malfunctioning that even the staff found inconvenient. The acting manager, Toriano, the first shift front desk people were extremely friendly, patient, competent and professional and compensated for any mishaps we experienced. They offered us a great deal for Mardi Gras weekend compared to the other hotels in the area. I would definitely recommend this hotel while visiting the city.Thank you for your comments, they are very important to us. They allow us to celebrate our successes, and also look for opportunities to improve. We will certainly share the details with our management team to make sure housekeeping is doing a more thorough job while cleaning the rooms while also taking care with guest items. We apologize you experienced these deficiencies. We thank you for taking the time to share and we are excited to see you again in the future.WayneGeneral Manager

They don't tell u when u book a room but when u get there a sign is saying ur card will be charged an extra 50 a night and it will be refunded n 7-10 days...at this point its too late to cancel because they will charge u anyway...so that's y the price seems cheap but n the end ur paying more and its higher than other places..
1	Wow... just a fantastic experience.. I stayed here with my wife to celebrate her 30th birthday. At check in, our room was not ready yet, but we were brought to the beautiful bar and given free drinks until our room was available. When our room was prepared, we took the elevator up to our floor. The butler was waiting at the elevator to greet us and directed us to our room and showed us around and how to use everything. Because we were celebrating a special occasion, we were treated to some special amenities in the form of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. It was quite unexpected and a really great touch. The room was wonderfully appointed and a generous size - particularly for a New York City hotel. The furniture was beautiful - all classic pieces from different eras... really just very well done. Silk wall coverings and beautiful crown moldings. Marble bathroom with a tv in the mirror over the sink. Quiet and isolated from the noise on the street. In the morning, we ate breakfast at the hotel - my wife said her breakfast was the best thing she had ever had to eat. Mine was delicious as well. We then took the house car (bentley service, complimentary for all hotel guests within a certain radius of the hotel) out to Columbus Circle for some shopping. The hospitality at the hotel is second to none. Really an excellent place to stay, meeting all of my expectations and exceeding some as well. This is one of the nicest hotels I've stayed at to date (definitely top 3)Dear jamGolf3, On behalf of The St. Regis New York, we thank you for both reviewing the property and allowing us to be a part of your New York City adventures and your celebration! We do hope you will be back to stay with us soon and ask that you please let us know when you are returning! We would love to have you as our guest in the future!Kindly,Hermann ElgerGeneral Manager
0	Dump!. Stayed at The Annex for a night. Room key did not work after we checked I had to walk all the way down to front desk to get another. Room was clean but had a moldy smell about it, I would have left if I had another place to go. The worst part about this hotel is that I put my credit card down to hold the room and upon checking out took care of the stay in cash. Charge was removed from credit card, 2 weeks later charge shows up again and my bank processed it The hotel has been unresponsive and bank will not take the charge off my card I never stay at this hole again.
1	New Orleans St Charles Inn. We stayed here with our daughter and two small dogs. The staff was very attentive to all our needs. Our dogs were greeted by friendly staff on arrival with dog treats and each time we left and returned to the hotel. The room and beds were great. Located on St Charles cable car line making it easy to catch the cable car to the zoo or to the French Quarter. We will certainly be staying at this inn on future returns to New Orleans. My wife says she is going to bring friends so they can set out side on courtyard in front of hotel and watch the cable car and the tree lined street.Thank you for taking the time to review your stay with us! We love when guests bring their pets! Treats are always kept at the front desk. We will see you the next time you come to town. Your wife and her friends will enjoy relaxing on our patio. It is a great area to enjoy some downtime on your trip!Kathleen Davis, Front Office Manager
1	Best Four Points I've stayed in. Due to its proximity near Key Arena (where I was seeing a concert), Id figure it would be best to stay at a nearby Starwood property. This particular location was about a 10 minute walk (1km) to the venue, with restaurants along the way, and its also near the Seattle Space Needle for those who want to do some sightseeing. Note that this property use to be under the management of Comfort Suites.I redeemed my Starpoints for this stay this was an SPG category 3 hotel, with redemption starting at 7,000 starpoints. Parking was 15/night and is underground and gated.A walk into the lobby and you can tell that it was recently renovated, with a huge lobby, dining, and bar area. There was a dedicated SPG check-in counter along with dedicated SPG rooms. This property was also recently upgraded to RFID sensor locks instead of the traditional old style swipe card door lock. This was a nice feature due to the recent security concerns with the swipe card locks.Upon check-in I was told that I received a complimentary upgrade to their Deluxe Room (from Traditional), which features larger rooms and a sofa/couch. The hotel window faces the Space Needle and the Bill Gates Foundation. I was also offered the choice of a complimentary drink or extra points. No point asking for complimentary wi-fi since their wi-fi cost is already included in the room price.For those who dont know, Four Points is considered one of the budget brandings for Starwood. I came here with no high expectations at all. However, to my surprise, I would consider this a pretty good property with clean rooms and comfortable bedding. In fact, I would have given the staff members my remaining 4 x 500 starpoints codes.if I hadnt forgot about them at home. Highly recommended.Thank you very much for the review. We are pleased to hear we exceeded your expectations and you enjoyed the comfort of your room. Are staff are among our best assets and we are thrilled to hear they made your stay pleasant. Thanks again for your kind words.
0	Not what I would expect from a Hilton Resort. My wife called in the day before to have a fruit plate delivered for my birthday the next morning. It never arrived. I talked to the front desk who had no record of a room service order. I was transferred to room service who had no record of the order. However, then it shows up on my bill! How does that happen if you have no record of the order coming in and completely fail to deliver the order itemsDear fisherad, Thank you for taking the time to send along your comments and I wanted to apologize for this situation. I would appreciate if you would contact me at the hotel so I rectify this charge. We appreciate your business and certainly want to take care of this. Regards, Mike FattaGeneral Manager
0	Dirty and worn. Location is Poor almost got hit two times trying to leave, 1st floor and room smelled musty. The internet was hard to login to and constantly dropping. The room refrigerator was not working. Carpet was dirty, smelled and had stains all over. Did not want my kids to touch anything. Food was nasty, I will Not stay at this location again.
0	Absolutely Disgusting. The place is in an absolutely secluded area, made me extremely nervous to leave my vehicle in such a place.The rooms..... Absolutely disgusting, there was a roach crawling on the bathroom floor. Mirrors were disgusting as well.I would dodge this hotel like roaches dodge light.
1	San Diego Weekend. Overall the experience was good. I would stay there again. The grounds are beauitiful, I will stay there again in June 2015. Great resturants close by and good access to other interesting attractions.Dear LeRoy W.:We appreciate your feedback and kind comments. Thank you for taking the time to write a review and being our guest! We are glad that you and your family enjoyed our beautifully landscaped property. It will be our pleasure to share your comments with our landscape maintenance team. As you know, the Best Western Seven Seas is conveniently located to all San Diego has to offer. In addition to our own great onsite restaurant, Seven Seas Caf, there are other excellent restaurants close by. We look forward to welcoming you back in June! Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff
1	Wonderful stay.... We were in Key West September 18th thru September 22nd. We were supposed to meet another couple but unfortunately they couldn't make it because Anne- Marie broke her ankle shortly before the trip. So, we got to the Saint Hotel that Sunday after being dropped off by a taxi that we took from the airport. I would have never believed that something so beautiful would be behind the front doors that we entered. Once inside,the place was magnificent! The room, the pool, the bar/restaurant area were all so nice! I would be remiss if I did not mention how friendly and personable the staff was, particularly Gustavo Lobo and Maria. Gustavo was so helpful and friendly. He was so pleasant to be around. He went out of his way to help us, especially when we were at the pool. And Maria, she was so personable and a pleasure to talk to. Both were outstanding people! Wish we could have stayed longer! We mistakenly left a bag of gifts at the hotel when we had already left for home and after calling the hotel to see if we had left it there, it was sent back to our home within five days! Great place, both hotel and island!!!!!!!!!Thank your for this amazing review.Please be sure that I will share this comment with Gustavo Maria. They make us proud everyday by providing a genuinely caring service to our guests.In addition, we are flatted that you truly appreciate the unique decor and saintly vibe of our establishment. And it is true that the Saint is full of surprises and mystery...On the other hand, I am sorry to hear that your trip with us was too short, but note that we will always be pleased to have you here in Key West.
1	Great Stay. I travel for business and I stayed at the Best Western Hacienda Hotel and it was great the staff was friendly and professional and the rooms were clean and well decorated and there was easy access to entertainment and food.Were pleased to hear you had a good stay while conducting business in San Diego. We make every effort to expectations of guests so your compliments of the cleanliness of the rooms and friendliness of the team are much welcomed. For business or leisure we offer a variety of conveniences including the exercise room, complimentary breakfast and computers in the lobby for guest use. We also offer a complimentary shuttle to major points around the city.
0	If it is broke ,they won't fix it. no light bulbs, locked safe. minnium tv receiption, no response to complaints for three days. called the desk and person that came did not fix TV ,said he would call back. never happened / Went to front desk and reported problems , nothing fixed . At check out , only so sorry
0	Room air quality not that good. We had to stay at the Econo Lodge because everywhere else was fully booked. The room was on the first floor and we had to go through the cranky staircase. There was water leak from the ac on the entire corridor in the first floor....More
1	Anime Weekend Atlanta. I stayed here when I was attending Anime Weekend Atlanta, I have always been a big fan of Anime and have wanted to create my own. I had a great experience. I enjoyed breakfast ad of course, a cup of coffee. This hotel was very convenient for me because I wanted to be close to all the events and all the panels. This hotel is known for there brunch.I would stay here again, if I could.I am glad you enjoyed your stay with us over the Anime convention. We too have so much fun during that group and always enjoy seeing the great costumes and creative work done by our customers. Hope to see you back this year!
0	Double booked room. Everything went well till about 130 am when we were woke from a peaceful sleep of someone trying to enter our room. I went to the door to find another couple who told me we were in their room. Apparently the front desk booked our room twice. We never were able to get back to sleep which was a major problem as I was there for surgery the next morning at John Hopkins. My wife was given a free breakfast ( I was unable to eat due to the surgery) and we were told we would receive a free voucher for a free night in the the future in the mail. As of the writing of this we still have not received anything that was promised. This hotel was the BWI Hilton.
1	Surprisingly Nice Hotel. This really is a nice hotel. Executive King Room was clean, spacious and comfortable. Large screen tv. Fridge in room was pretty quiet ( a good thing!) Comfortable bed. Club food was also surprisingly good, fresh and well maintained. Staff was friendly and helpful. This hotel has a large central atrium. It is connected via a pedestrian bridge over the busy road to a very nice mall ( and a nice but not very busy one on the walk ). Lots of parking. Just across the freeway from the new Braves stadium will make this a very desirable place although does not look like this is a very pedestrian friendly area in general and no apparent easy walking route to the stadium.I have great news, there is a pedestrian bridge being build outside my hotel to the Braves stadium. It is scheduled to be open for the first pitch next year making the area around the hotel even more exciting! Come back and see us soon!
1	Trendy Upscale Hotel In Fishermans Wharf. This hotel is on it's second or third owner. Hotel Zephyr, known for their trendy hotels, is the current owner and at the time of this review is still in the process of doing some renovations. There is no restaurant, some of the elevator buttons still say Raddison on them, and the elevators may or may not work the entirety of your stay.Overall, though, if you get in on a discount (I suggest shopping online for a good deal, they are always better than what the hotel website offers) then you'll get your money's worth.The service is excellent, the rooms themselves, are magnificent, and your location is perfect. The rooms are unique and several steps beyond your normal chain hotels. The beds are extremely comfortable. We got the standard king room with a view of the city and it was superb. Spacious rooms, excellent bathrooms, and comfortable beds.I highly recommend this hotel. There are three great breakfast places within easy walking distance include Mama's (get their EARLY!), Beach Street Grill, and Hollywood Cafe. All are worth it. The latter two have a shorter wait time typically, but still, get their before you get hungry.
0	Don't pick this place for the free breakfast.. Breakfast was awful the one time we had it. All of the days prior it was closed earlier than it was supposed to be. We were put in a room with a bucket catching a leak and then they moved us right across from the elevator where we could hear it ding all night. We won't stay here again.
0	Allerginn. We stayed here on our way out to a Midwest trip and it was very unsatisfactory. The pillows were down, which I am extremely allergic to. I tried calling the guest service who didn't answer, twice. Went down physically and they didn't have any allergy free pillows available for use. Recommended that I use bundled up towels to sleep on. The room smelled very bad when we arrived. The only redeeming factor was they had a nice pool / hot tub.
0	Do not recommend. The motel is poorly managed and maintained. The smoking rooms reek of smoke and the non-smoking rooms are not much better. Expectation for a motel are naturally low, and this fits below average for a motel. The management was disappointing at best. Not worth your money or time.
1	Im never disappointed by a Kimpton. Stayed here for a large trade show because its conveniently located to many restaurants and other places I needed to be. In true Kimpton form, the property was well-appointed and exceptionally clean. And the staff was wonderful.Despite a contract dispute with the housekeeping union (which affected many other hotels around the city), they were very accommodating. I was only in for 2 nights so didnt really mind making my own bed, and they readily offered to provide clean towels.As is the case In most urban hotels, the bathroom was very small, but they made the most of the available space. The work desk was fine for my needs and there were plenty of outlets for charging devices.Id definitely stay here again.Great customer service is what we aim for! Thanks for your loyalty to Kimpton and staying with us! We work hard to make our guests happy and appreciate your feedback!
0	NOT what the hotel website claims. Do not trust what you read on the hotel's website. This is emphatically NOT a luxury, boutique hotel. It is not artful, luxurious, or intimate as the website claims. It is a poorly maintained, mediocre hotel. Tiny cramped lobby tiny, ancient, slow elevator barely big enough for two people and one piece of luggage each. Cramped room, so small the door to the bathroom only opened half way before it hit one of the two double beds. Old, cheap furnishings (my wife said it was reminiscent of the furnishings she had in her first apartment after college). The mattress was so hard we had to put the comforter under the bottom bed sheet to try to add some softness. Like sleeping on lightly padded plywood. Bathroom had stained grout on the tile, mold in the corners, stains on the mirror, dysfunctional shower head... (I have submitted pictures to document the poor quality and maintenance of the room.) And this was a better room than the first one they put us in. The original room was blazingly hot and the only window for ventilation opened onto a noisy street. At our request, they moved us to the third floor on the back side of the hotel. Three friends of ours got a room here, too, and they complained about the heat and noise. The hotel's breakfast consisted of a bunch of loaves of bread, a toaster, peanut butter and jam, and coffee and tea. There was a small refrigerator and microwave in the room, fortunately. I can only recommend this hotel if you can get a room for 100/night or less and you don't really care about quality or comfort. It's only asset is location. They do have a nice wine bar.Dear Paul H,we are sorry you did not have a good experience at the FItzgerald Hotel. As you have mentioned in your review, boutique hotels have usually a particular style which is different from city to city, and that varies from one boutique hotel to another: the Fitzgerald hotel does have its own unique style, which is a classic post-Victorian San Francisco one, with a furnishing and an elevator that are meant to recall that time. We understand that some customers may not like it, but that is also what makes the Fitzgerald hotel different from the others. Also, since we are downtown, there is nothing much we can do about the noise, but we will follow up on your suggestion and try to see whether we can do some work to better isolate the building from street noise. With respect to the poor maintenance, I have printed out your review and passed it on to our staff who is already working on fixing the issues you were mentioning: thank you very much for that. We hope your experience won't prevent you from staying again with us next time you are in San Francisco, and until then we will work to make sure that most of the issues you have found will be resolved. Thank you again for staying with us!
1	Great location!. We loved the ocean view from our room. The location was great for walking around La Jolla or just along the shore where we saw harbor seals, sea lions and whales. San Diego was very close and we could easily explore new areas around San Diego. The service was excellent with little touches such as water and candy each night. It was nice to have breakfast with our stay included with our room and drinks in the lobby. We will definitely be back!Greetings Mark B,Thank you for taking the time to review Pantai Inn. We are so pleased that you enjoyed your experience at our Inn as well as our phenomenal location. Our location, as you stated, definitely lends itself well to taking off on foot and exploring all that both the village of La Jolla has as well as the wonderful coastline. I appreciated your noting the teams attention to detail and ensuring that you were satisfied. Each of them do a wonderful job at looking after our guests. On behalf of everyone here, we eagerly await your return. Warmest wishes,Mike
1	Great location, pretty rooms, 12pm checkout. I'll start by saying if you're looking for over the top, extraordinary, then this is not the hotel for you. But, if you're looking for something that is clean, has a great art deco fitout, and in a TERRIFIC location, then keep reading. Location - in the Theatre District which means that all the major theatres are easy to walk to. Millenium Park is about a 7 minute walk. The Magnificent Mile is about 15 mins walk (could probably walk faster if people didn't walk 3 abreast the path).Rooms - we had a room on the 5th floor. It was fine, bathroom a bit small with very little counterspace. Beware - the bottles of water left out on the desk are NOT free. Bed was very comfortable. Pillows were awful - either little more than some cotton wool bunched together or a huge bag of cement. Rooms were quiet. There was evidence in the hallway of someone's big night out a couple of rooms down but we didn't hear a thing. Staff - polite enough, but nothing special. Great to let us have the room a bit earlier than regulation checkin. The late checkout is very handy. They can keep your bags for you while you wander the city. Concierge were particularly helpful but no one else could help with directions to theatres, bars etc. Disappointing. Valet car parking - at 63/night, it's definitely not cheap, but they will hold your car until 6pm which is great if you're catching a matinee show somewhere. There are plenty of self park lots nearby. Would we stay here again Probably!Happy to hear you enjoyed your stay and were able to take advantage of our excellent downtown location! Thanks again for choosing our hotel and we look forward to welcoming you back in the future!
0	Good location. Came for a sporting event. Hotel is old and dated but clean. They are in the middle of renovating it.
1	Great location and services at the right price. on the edge of the french quarter, easy access, courteous service, efficient, clean, valet parking, personalized welcome, correct price. Not for a romantic stay but perfectly fine for business or family stayThank you for your review of the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans! We're so happy to hear you enjoyed your stay and we appreciate the feedback. If there is anything we can do to make your next visit to the Whitney better, please don't hesitate to let us know. Thank you and we look forward to seeing you again soon!Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
1	Home from home in San Diego. This comfortable , well appointed hotel turned out to be a very good choice for my short stay in San Diego. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet and early evening 'Happy Hours' were unexpected surprises. Casual dining at the bar or at the tables near the pool was ideal. The free wifi was appreciated but I was a little disappointed that the courtesy shuttle to and from the airport has been discontinued. The hotel is only a 15 min walk from the delights of the San Diego Old Town. The Transit Centre offers a choice of bus or Trolley downtown, or a no 30 bus for the 30 minute ride to La Jolla. A day pass covering both buses and trolleys is great value. With the distances between attractions in San Diego cab rides can be expensive.Good day Ronald S,We are so happy to hear you felt welcome in our home and we would like to thank you so very much for sharing your experience. It is so nice to know you found our team to be very friendly and helpful. We have shared this wonderful feedback with all our team members to ensure proper acknowledgement and commendation. We would also like to thank you for sharing all these great San Diego travel tips with our team and the Tripadvisor community. Please come see us again very soon should your travels bring you back to the San Diego area.Thank youJonathan GerberFront Office ManagerFour Points by Sheraton San Diego Sea World
1	Nice hotel. I stayed here recently for a business trip. The pros: location, food, nice rooms and amenities (comfortable bed, hot water, quality soap, shampoo and body wash, in room coffee). Most of the staff is great. I had a bit of a scratchy voice when I misplaced my room key and the front desk guy handed me a bottle of water and told me it sounded like I needed it which was so thoughtful and above and beyond. Kudos to the staff! I ate almost all my meals here, and was very impressed by the food. The cons: when I checked in they told me they could not find my reservation (I was part of the group). People spell my last name wrong a lot so I asked them to check that as well and she said that it was not listed under the incorrect spelling either. I wound up having to go to another hotel because the hotel was booked which was very inconvenient. Turns out they did have my last name spelled wrong, and the front desk clerk must not have checked throughly or cared. The next day I found out they had me listed as a no-show. All the other employees I met were super friendly helpful and thoughtful. I was able to check in the second night as another group had left and my company figured out the error. Since the rooms face the atrium, it can be a bit noisy especially if there's a function downstairs.Overall, I would stay here again, just the check in process was disappointing and made things very inconvenient for me for the first day I was in Atlanta for my conference. I am so sorry for the error in finding your reservation. I will share your feedback with my team and appreciate you taking the time.
1	Loved this place!. I stayed at the Marriott Vacation Club Pulse during Memorial Day weekend from the Bay Area. Unfortunately, I had pulled my hamstring prior to my arrival and was in extreme pain after walking through 2 airports and pulling my luggage. The hotel staff took me to my room in a wheelchair and brought me ice and other items to assist with my pain. On top of that, they gave me a Get Well card signed by all the staff. The room is nice (not too big and not too small) and the furniture is well appointed. The bathroom is a really great size with the closets located inside the restroom along the wall (nice touch). Before I arrived I read the reviews where other travelers complained about a reflection on the sliding door that separates the living room from the bedroom at night. I did not experience that. I enjoyed the indoor pool/jacuzzi and the close proximity to the Donut Bar (the donuts are splendid), the House of Blues, as well as other restaurants, banks and stores. The street it is located on is more quaint than lively, but you're a stone's throw away from the action. The room service is great ( I ordered breakfast a couple of mornings) as well and the delivery team makes sure you're satisfied. They also have a discount card avail (not sure it's available to all traveler profiles) that you can use at nearby restaurants which was a plus. I really enjoyed this property which I will definitely book when I return to the San Diego area.Thank you for a perfect review! We are so happy to hear you enjoyed your stay with us here in San Diego.
0	Not happy. First I booked Thursday booking.com I input the wrong exp date on credit card. My mistake. However booking.com said that my.room needs a new card I rein put the correct number and got a confirmation. Now it gets ugly. The lady up from said.the manager cxld. The room.

0	Pretty bad experience resulted in us not even staying the night. We had to quickly find a hotel late at night, after coming to town for a family emergency. Super 8 had room, and so we went ahead and got a room there. The woman at the front desk gave us our key and told us the room number. The exterior of the hotel isn't the best, but I wasn't too...

1	Thanks giving week 2016. Was great! Everything was wonderful and would stay again there . It was clean and well maintained . Front desk clerk was friendly and helpful . The bed was comfortable , the shower head needed more pressure , as to take off the shampoo fast . Everything was great , thanks for a great stayYou are welcome! Thank you for being our guest during Thanksgiving week. Your words, everything was wonderful are music to our ears and I look forward to sharing your review with my team.

I travel constantly and stay at hotels nearly every night and I can say that this place is no place for any human being the blankets are unwashed and the Bathroom is disgusting, everything stinks and is amazingly filthy. After a full day of flying cross country and driving 200 miles I was too exhausted to leave... An there is... More
0	Hotel badly needs an upgrade. Bad value for the price. Room was dirty, carpet stained and curtains torn. Breakfast was adequate, well-prepared. Had to report noisy tenants on the floor above, they finally went to sleep or passed out...not certain staff did anything about the problem. Exterior was littered and needed cleaning up.
1	The Best Hotel Down Town. This was my first trip to San Francisco, and this hotel was one of the cheaper ones I could find. What a surprise it was, probably the most high end hotel I've been to. Nim and Phil were amazing people to talk to and were very helpful in telling me how to get around the town. The room was amazing and the bed was better than the one I have at home. It's about 80ft from the entrance to China town and very close to union square. I couldn't imagine picking a better place to stay in San Francisco.Thank you very much for your comments. We are glad that you found us to exceed all of your expectations. Nim and Phil are great team members and you were in great hands with them during your stay. I am sure you will agree, but many of our guests comment about our beds and their comfort. Please make sure to visit us on your next trip to San Francisco.Best,Bruce PFront Office Manager
1	Great Experience!. This a beautiful hotel that is just a few blocks away from Bourbon Street.... Such great charm and not a typical chain hotel... We were traveling with another couple but all the double rooms were booked, so they had planned on sleeping on an air mattress in our room. Our room wasn't ready when we got to town, so we checked in and left our bags... When arriving back at the hotel, the sweet lady at the front desk said she had a surprise for us... They had upgraded us to a beautiful suite, free of charge! Such a great experience and all the employees couldn't have been nicer!!! Loved, loved, loved our stay here!!We are thrilled you had such a great experience with us at Bienville House! We hope to see you back in NOLA again soon.
1	Front Desk - Great. Tracy Robinson at the Front Desk was a gem. She was always personable and helped us when we had any questions. She provided us with valuable information about the surrounding area and the nature of various places to visit, to include transportation options. The breakfast that was provided was far better than I had expected. My daughter and I ate there every morning.Tracy is an asset to our company with 34 years of service and counting! Our staff works hard to provide our guests with a memorable stay and I am pleased to know you had one. We hope you will come back and see us again soon.
1	Great experience - clean, quiet, friendly. My wife and I spent lots of time searching for hotels in San Francisco - we were travelling to the city for our 10th wedding anniversay, so we wanted something special. We were really worried by some of the reviews of other hotels (too noisy, poor location, bad smells, poor service, etc.). By chance, we happened upon a review of the Orchard Garden Hotel. It looked good via the website and our initial contact with staff on the booking line was positive. So we took a chance. It helped that the hotel promoted its eco-credentials.When we got there, we were really pleased with our choice. Just steps away from the China Town gate, a few minutes from Union Square and about 10 minutes walk from the nearest BART station - so plenty of bustle if we wanted. However, the road the hotel is on is a relatively quiet one and this is helped by really good double-glazing (as you might expect from an eco-hotel). To be fair, we were staying on the 9th floor. But the room ventilation was quiet and there were no other noises to disturb our sleep - beds are really comfortable, too.The rooms are very nice with a good, clean and light decor. Nicely appointed, too. We ate in the restaurant the first night - the food is very good but, as you might expect from a hotel in SF, quite expensive. We knew it would be and it didn't detract from the experience. We ate breakfast at one of the many cafes in the area - once again, this hotel is in a good location.The staff are friendly and genuinely welcoming with good local knowledge. There is even a little room with a couple of PCs and a printer for Internet access.In conclusion, we are really happy with our choice of hotel and will defintely make this our hotel of choice for our next trip to SF. I thoroughly recommend the Orchard Garden.
1	Warm,friendly service Clean rooms Great Food!. My friend and I selected this hotel for the extra room provided--a nice living room area that included a great flat-screen TV, small frig, microwave and sink. An ironing board and iron provided the ability to have our clothes look freshly pressed each day, the bathroom was beautiful and clean and the bed was very comfortable! (Great TV in the bedroom also). The made to order breakfast each day was of good quality and service was warm and friendly the evening drinks and snacks were great also. Maid service kept our room spotless! There isn't anything I could recommend that would have added to our hotel experience--I will definitely look for an Embassy Suites everywhere I go!
0	Great location / Horrible Hotel. The lobby and staff were very nice, but once you leave downstairs it is run down, has an old dcor, and smells far from pleasing. The rooms are tiny, and we asked to be switched to another room because the air conditioning unit was so loud. The 2nd room was equally as bad. I work in the hospitality industry and would never recommend this hotel to anyone.Hi Zanzibella - Thank you for your review following your recent stay with us. While our rooms are cozy in nature, as Chicago's first Silver LEED certified hotel we're proud of our eco-friendly efforts. We appreciate your candid feedback about some items not being to standards in the room, such as the air conditioning. We will certainly ensure these types for things are checked daily so as not to occur again. We hope to welcome you back in the future.
0	racist / rude loss prevention team.. accused of smoking in my room. only young black kids in the hotel. ima 24 year old well put together chef. needed time away with my girlfriend. Managers and loss prevention kept harassing us. Sunday morning knocked on my door and walked in without my consent and literally said oh i though you were smoking in here and walked out. I was hearing noise all night which i complained about, but nobody did anything about it: yet you're worried about if im smoking when your hotel is Loud and your staff is racist and rude because all of my greetings did not seem genuine. your loss prevention is not an army and i should sue for grievance. I complained about loud banging all morning and nobody did anything or come to see if it was still happening. Instead I got your army of LP at my door accusing me of smoking once again. without even saying sorry for bothering you. I WILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN AND I AM A MARRIOT REWARDS MEMBER. There were stains on my bed which i let go. my towels were not clean so i requested new ones. You service was so bad , and biased my girlfriend told me not to complain about the towels or buy from your marketplace. This is going to get solved in a court matter. This was the worst experience i have had at a hotel and i travel frequently.
1	Welcoming, accommodating, and so convenient. After arriving from an overnight cross country flight from CA, my family of five was tired and only wanted to flop down somewhere to get a little sleep. We arrived earlier than expected, so our rooms were not ready. Although housekeeping wasn't to arrive until later to prepare our rooms, thankfully Emilio worked diligently to get us ONE room, so that we could all lie down after our long night. Then, the second room was available later that morning. Everyone at this hotel was wonderful, from housekeeping to bar/restaurant to all of the staff at the front desk. I would book at this hotel again, if I have the good fortune to visit the Orlando area again! Thank you, Hilton Garden Orlando!Roy, thank you for your kind words regarding your stay at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport. It is always a pleasure to read comments like yours that recognize our staff for their great hospitality. We're happy to share your gracious review to our team especially Emilio. Thank you again and we hope that you will return soon with your family.Sincerely,Michael GoldwasserGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport
0	***DUMP ALERT!. This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. Beware of room 20. This is the room with the weird vent on the door. So noisy and cold because you can't close it. Holes in sheets. Grimy, old and dirty. You are desperate if you stay here.
0	Advertised: Home on the lake. Not on the lake!. We stayed at the Allatoona Inn's lake home. We were very disappointed that the house was quite a walk from the lake, not on the lake, as advertised. The lake is beautiful but we were not able to use it as not all of the people in our group could make the walk to the beach. The house, although cute,... More
1	Classy hotel near Union Square that delivers on service. We stayed at the Hotel Diva for 4 nights in early-mid October and it met nearly all of our expectations, and exceeded plenty.The service was the standout - all the staff we dealt with were professional, but also friendly and sometimes jovial - they seemed to enjoy working there which is always a good sign. The location is great - whilst not ON Union Square it is close enough to walk to the main shopping areas as well as public transport systems like the Muni and BART. It's always one of the main things we look for in a hotel and Diva definitely ticked that box for us.The only thing we were a bit surprised about was the size of the rooms - they are quite small, although we only booked their cheapest so this may not be the same in the pricier rooms. We had been warned though that all hotel rooms in San Fran are tiny so we got over it and utilised the quite reasonable amount of storage space and it was fine. Also took a bit of getting used to having the basin and vanity outside of the bathroom! I guess a creative way to use the space. The decor of the room as with the hotel is modern and trendy which we liked.As for the price we thought it was quite good value for money, despite our 4th night being much more expensive - being a Saturday night and also over Fleet week and with the President's Cup golf on this was understandable.We are travellers that love variety so usually try out different hotels, but the next time we are in San Fran we will strongly consider staying at Diva again.
0	A 2 star older hotel can still be clean. I note there have been some renovations to this hotel however no matter how much you renovate you still need to employ enough staff to keep a hotel clean and well maintained. This does not seem to be happening at this hotel. First we stayed for three days and never once did we see a manager or housekeeping or building... More
1	The Best Hotel I've Ever Stayed In NYC!. In the words of Shirley Bassey: Where do I begin Jajaja. Well the rooms are sumptuous and big! Especially by NYC standards and compared to hotels of the same category. The service is amazing you feel pampered all throughout your stay. The food unfortunately is not up to the standard of the hotel. This doesn't mean it's bad at all, yet nothing spectacular. And last but not least the best part is that it has the best location!Dear CutbertoParraNicolin, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor. We hope to see you again soon!Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager
1	Hilton Garden Inn Orlando - Awesome!. I didn't think I would like this hotel but on the contrary I loved it! The hotel is centrally located on Semoran Blvd about 10 minutes from Orlando airport.First, we were warmly greeted and asked if we were Hilton members which was nice. I must add, the decor was very welcoming!Up the elevator and into our room - very nice. Comfortable, king size, cozy bed. The first thing I did was to jump on the bed and roll from side to side. The amenities in the room was nice, TV, soap, shampoo, etc. Sitting area and free wifi in the room and free on-site parking were welcome additions. The location of the hotel gave you many opportunities for restaurants and shopping -- so many choices your head will spin. The good addition was buffet breakfast with freshly made waffles -- my favorite! I was in waffle heaven!We drove to a nearby mall which was nice - I don't recall the name but it was easy getting there. We rented a car from Dollar Car Rental in the airport. I would never rent from Dollar at the Orlando Airport again - I was on line for 1 hour. Awful! Overall it was a great hotel and will be added to my favorites list!Dear Guest talyah, I would like to thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to write about your experience during your stay at the Hilton Garden inn Orlando Airport.

1	Nice hotel!. My friend and I have stayed here twice on two different trips to the San Diego area. It is close to downtown San Diego and Ocean Beach which is important to me. We eat over in Ocean Beach but see theatre shows in San Diego. They did not have any 2 Queen bed rooms available upon check in this past visit but upgraded us for free to a King size bed which worked out perfectly. The rooms are dark (can make them dark for sleeping), clean and no bed bugs as I check before bringing in my luggage. I always wish we could stay more than one night as it's my number one choice of a place to stay in the San Diego area. Some hotels charge you for parking which I just dislike. I did my research before staying here the first time and it paid off. We had a horrible experience up in Vista and did not want a repeat of another crappy hotel. Next trip down to San Diego for another theatre show we will be staying here again. Can't recommend this place enough! It's easy freeway access off/on the 8 along hotel row.Dear Jeannette:Thank you for choosing the Best Western Seven Seas for your recent hotel accommodations and for being our guest! We are glad you enjoyed our convenient and freeway accessible location, which is close to all San Diego has to offer. It is also great knowing you appreciated our complimentary parking and clean guestrooms. Your business is very important to us and we value your feedback. Guest satisfaction and meeting with their expectations are quite important to us, and we are delighted we met with yours! It was our pleasure to provide a great experience and we look forward to welcoming you back on your next theatre trip down to San Diego! Most Sincerely, Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff
1	Customer service is top notch. I stayed at the Bienville House one night in June. I had booked the room through a popular 3rd party reservation company. Long story short the reservation was wrong and the 3rd party agency was not willing to help. Luckily Tara was working the front desk and was so helpful to solve our problem (booked in a room without enough beds). Tara quickly took care of our issue and was extremely helpful and friendly about the whole situation. The hotel itself has nice character but the best part about the stay was Tara's friendliness and willingness to help.Thank you for taking the time to share your positive experience with Bienville House on TripAdvisor. We will certainly let Tara know!
1	Somewhere between Hilton and Ritz. Came here because our first and second choices hotels weren't available. It was a nice substitute at the last minute! While it doesn't have the upscale feel of the Lodge at Torrey Pines, it was adequate for our needs. The grounds were lovely--styled to look as an old Spanish hacienda. Everything was extremely clean in fact, it felt as thought the hallways had been newly painted and wallpapers. Rooms were, frankly, not at the level of the grounds. They were clean and nicely appointed, but on the smaller side (we were in a more standard room because suites weren't available.) Our room was an upgrade from our companions', but other than a free bottle of wine, we were unable to understand why. Thus, that upgrade is not worth the additional cost unless the bottle of wine is worth it to you. I had a very pleasant experience with Brent, the concierge. He was accommodating, helpful, and took his time trying to get us the right restaurant for our needs, which were to accommodate a rather large party with specific tastes. Kudos to him.Phone service is polite, but it took a long time for every call to be answered by both the operator (on two occasions) and valet (on 2 out of 4 occasions.) Maybe not quite enough staffing. In fact, staff were almost nonexistent. Usually, you see service people and staff walking around resorts, but we didn't see any, except for the cafe, check-in, and one housekeeping person. Over 3 days/2 nights. Not a big deal, unless you need staff.I believe there is no on-site parking except valet. This may be a cost consideration.There were no noise complaints except for the doors! They slam shut, very loudly, and woke us up several times. This appeared to be the interior closet doors.One issue: tiny pillows! The sleep pillows appeared sized for a child's bed, about 2/3 the size of a normal pillow.Overall, it was a pleasant stay, and we would consider staying there again. However, at the risk of sounding like a snob, we do usually travel at a higher level, so it wouldn't be our first choice.
1	Drury New Orleans. We arrived just before Mardi Gras yet had no probelm booking this hotel. Though centrally located, It is a good walk from most areas. The trolley stops just a block away which is nice. Take a ride -- and see how close it comes to parked vehicles. Breakfast is always a treat, though Drury San Antonio had a wider variety of choices. And at 5:30pm it looked like guests actually dine on the wings, baked potatoes, hot dogs and the chili provided in lieu of heading out to dinner. Rouses, an attractive grocery, is nearby for quick fill-ins or paninis made to order or practically anything else food-related. The bed, in my opinion, was a bit soft as were the pillows. I wish they had queen-size beds too. The staff is very accommodating and willing to make suggestions for clubs, restaurants or attractions. The Drury is clean and modern and is currently building an addition which should provide more variety of rooms and maybe even a fancier breakfast. Oh, they even arranged for transportation from the airport.
0	Toxic. Garbage hotel beware do not use the toxic water there if you shower in it you will smell like waste water
0	Coldest night ever!!!. The heater was not on in the room and it was 24 degrees outside, There were huge spider webs. Could not connect to the internet and if I had been able to I would have known my flight was cancelled....
0	Do not recommend. Took wife for romantic night for valentines day, Rooms look nice on internet pictures but somewhat run down and smelly. Felt more like a cheap hotel but with more amenities (hot tub and large 2 head shower and bistro table). Overall my wife felt so uncomfortable that if she was not so tired we would have left without sleeping there... More
1	Very good hotel, with clever staff!. Very helpful and friendly staff, who upgraded the room, even though they could not see from their notes that it should accomodate 5 persons. They also gave very good advice regarding restaurants and nearby attractions like Six Flags in LA county. The beds were very comfortable and clean. The breakfast room was also very tidy and had plenty of space. There as also a nice pool there (which we did not make use of). Very good value for money. It also had a convenient location for us, close to Camarillo's attractions as well as other places within driving distance, like for example LA, Santa Barbara, Malibu and Solvang. The business room was also very useful, and things were in order.
0	More of a motel, not hotel!. Our room smelled like cigarette and it was dingy! Thankfully the manager was willing to give us a new room and upgraded to a suite. I think ALL the carpet needs to be replaced in all the rooms. This place should be categorized as a motel, not a hotel. Staff was nice though.
1	Great place to stay. My boyfriend and I decided to do a quick weekend trip to Atlanta. He has been staying at this hotel for a decade and recommended that we stay here. I'm glad we did. The building has a great vibe to it: old-school, independent, classic. The staff were super nice and always said hi and bye as we came and left. The rooms are fine. They aren't luxury, but we weren't looking for luxury. Bed was comfy, linens were clean. Windows opened, so we were able to have fresh air. Pirate the cat stays there and is super cool, too. I'll definitely come back.
0	Horrendous service and unsafe. We were woken up in the middle of the night by the radiator which was scalding hot and hissing. When we complained to staff they were disinterested, and carelessly moved us into a different room, it took them 3 attempts to find us a room without the same problem. When we spoke to the manager in the morning to ask for some sort of compensation for being put in a room with a dangerous radiator, and for being moved 3 times in the middle of the night, she nonchalantly informed me that this is what you get for 20 and they have a no refund policy. This is not my understanding of a no refund policy. Please don't waste your money here. The toilets don't even have sinks.
0	Do not use for Weddings!!!. This is by far the worst wedding vendor I've work with while planning my wedding. I'm planning my wedding in San Diego from NYC and chose Estancia as my hotel for out of town guests. BIG Mistake!!! I was initially going to hold two events here during my wedding weekend but they are being held at another hotel because of the poor service. Initially the venue was beautiful with such a luxurious pool spa. The group sales manager was responsive until the contract for the room block was signed and then it began to take a long time to return emails or phone calls. The Group event manager John never said congratulations or made me feel special. I know this property holds a lot of events but I seriously felt like a number and super unimportant. The group rate sounded like a good deal when we initially spoke. John from Estancia told me the rate was about 50 less per night than they charge in July. But my guests easily found the same room online for 50-80 per night below the contracted rate so they booked online and did not use my room block link. The room block was suppose to be a better deal for a large group. However, Estancia has a clause that if guests aren't booking rooms at the hotel the bride can be held financially responsible. My guests booked rooms at the hotel be did it not at my contracted rate since it was higher than their advertised price online. The group sales manager called me to talk about how very few of the rooms had been booked for my block. I told him that guests were booking online to get a better deal. I asked to have the online rate matched. He threatened to sue me per the contract unless guests booked under my block. Apparently it's in the contract that the Hotel Estancia's revenue goals are not met then the bride groom will be presented with a bill that if they don't pay they will immediately be sued even if the rooms are rented by other guests or if guests of the wedding make reservations outside the hotel block. How rude! I tried to get someone else or a manager of this manager but no one would help me. I called several times for a few weeks. I tried the front desk and the 800 number but kept getting this same guy John so I basically gave up and moved on with the event planning. I thought the group rate was supposed to be a discount compared to what guests can book themselves. at least that's what they told me when speaking with group sales initially. It seems like Estancia is going to meet their revenue goals for my wedding so good for them but it's really been at my expense. Several awesome friends were nice enough to cxl online reservations and move to my room block so we would meet the minimum to not get sued by the Estancia because the revenue requirements for the room block are not met. But this was really embarrassing to have to tell my wedding guests that we would be sued they didn't change their reservations to pay more per nigh!!!About a month later, I asked if we could get group transporting to the wedding venue and the group sales wrote an excruciatingly long winded email that basically said they don't do group transportation to weddings. Which is odd because when we toured the property they showed us a Mercedes Van for group transportation to events....This time I absolutely lost it with them and was really fed up. I talked to a friend who suggested that I call Bacarra. So I called the sister resort and told them what was going on and asked for help getting ahold of someone else with Estancia. Got the Hotel GM's email number and they finally agreed to use the Van to take guests to the wedding. They are still not very responsive and seem to be grudgingly polite with me. IThe sales manager of managers Brad seems to be somewhat easier to deal with and he did say congratulations which was very refreshing. However, we are still technically under the required number of rooms for our event. The Estancia agreed to allow a couple guests to be listed under our reservation even though they booked outside of our wedding block. I've asked for updated reports again to prove we are now at the contracted number of rooms but they are very unresponsive. I'm trying to document everything as they already verbally threatened me with legal action. I really hope this all works itself out and that we have a reasonable solution to all this. Initially I wanted to have my spa day before the wedding and post wedding brunch with Estancia as well as my welcome party. But due to the problems with communication I moved forward with other event spaces. You guys have a beautiful property. I wish the communication was warmer and that brides were treated with greater care kindness by your team.I have written 3 emails and made several calls to the hotels General Manager, Mairead Hennessy about this and have received no response from her. I still don't have updated reports from the hotel to prove that we are meeting The Estancia's revenue goals for our room block even though I have reached out extensively for several days. I called 7 times yesterday and sent many emails to the group sales team. My wedding date is less than 2 weeks away and this is so unbelievable.
1	Could not have chose a better hotel. We stayed her for a night while visiting New Orleans and was very pleased with our choice of hotel.The hotel was very well located to walk around the city and a good location for driving into.The hotel room itself was an average size and big enough for our needs. The room was clean and the bed comfortable. The room had a fridge and coffee making facilities but did not have a safe. The bathroom was a bit on the small side with a toilet and bath with shower over and a sink outside the bathroom. The bathroom again was very clean. The room was very quiet we never heard a noise all night.There was valet parking available for 30 per night.The complimentary breakfast was good, there was plenty of choice and it was well organised with a clean breakfast area and helpful staff.The night reception was excellent. There was unlimited soft drinks available, 3 alcoholic drinks per person and food. The food was best we have ever seen at an evening reception this included hot dogs, nachos, baked potatoes, salad, chilli.There was also popcorn available late afternoon into the night time available in the lobby area along with coffee and soft drinks. I think soft drinks were also available for a few hours inthe morning. The staff at the hotel reception were very friendly and helpful.I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting New Orleans and if we ever return I would stay here. I will also look out for Drury Inns now when our travels.
0	never again. Called several days ahead to make sure we had lakeside.Was told maybe but to check early on the day of our stay. When we arrived we were told not a chance. But we would have a room with a view of the space needle. What we got was a street level room with a view of a six story building behind the hotel. We were later moved to city view seventh floor. Breakfast was warm to cold. Wi fi on the other hand was very good. But not for 300. Edgewater is a little more but worth it. Terry from PortlandThanks for your feedback and I apologize for your frustration with your room. We upgrade guests to the lake view rooms when possible but the only surefire way to guarantee a lake view room is to reserve one from the start. I am sorry if this wasn't fully explained at the time you made your reservation. Our views of Lake Union are amazing!
1	Will stay here again. The hotel is fully functional. I like the fact there are no hallways, as you enter the rooms from the outside. Parking is plentiful. The pool wasn't filled and that was a bummer. The lady at the desk upon check in was pretty snippy. The gal working the desk the next morning was awesome. The restaurant, Bailey's, was worth the stay alone. The food was amazing. The room wasn't perfect. But there were plenty of channels to watch, and the soft water was nice. The bed was big and comfy. There were a couple parts of the room that weren't the cleanest and the exhaust fan in the bathroom didn't work. All in all I stand behind this place being a good choice if you're looking to stay in Norfolk. Don't give the Hampton all your money. Stay here instead.
1	Nice stay in San Diego. Spent a couple of nights here during our stay in San Diego. The hotel is well located near attractions and shopping and easily accessible to highways. It is not a new facility but it appears to be cared for. Beautiful grounds with a nice pool area and two hot tubs. Very helpful staff and a clean facility. We were pleased with our stay.Dear Kat F.: Thank you for choosing us for your recent hotel accommodations and for being our guest! We are delighted to hear that you appreciated our convenient location, which is close and accessible to all San Diego has to offer. The Best Western Seven Seas is an older property however, we are continually upgrading our guestrooms, exterior, and other amenities in order to meet the needs of our guests. It is nice to know you also enjoyed our beautifully landscaped grounds, our nice pool area, and hot tubs. Guest satisfaction and meeting with their expectations are quite important to us, so it will be our pleasure to share your kind remarks to our entire staff. Thank you for taking the time to write a review and we look forward to welcoming you back, so you and your family may enjoy another nice stay in San Diego! Most Sincerely, Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff
1	Excellent customer service!. We spent months searching for the perfect place to stay for our 10th anniversary trip to Oahu. After reading several great reviews, we chose Ocean Tower.After having made the reservations on expedia.com, we called the hotel to see if we could reserve a king bed with a balcony. Nothing could be for sure but the nice young man said he would put us down for one.We arrived in Honolulu late, after a long flight. Check in for us was a breeze! In just a minute we had our key cards. We were well pleased with the room. We were able to get the king bed and balcony after all! Upon entering the room, we were greated with a cool clean room. We couldn't have been more pleased with our room. The was even a desk area where we were able to set up our lap top, and a safe, no extra charge.Leonor Wong met us the next morning with a smile and an offer of custard pie and fresh pineapple to share. She was very friendly as we chatted, she asked what we were in Hawaii for. We answered with it being our 10 year anniversary. After some exploring on the island we came back to our room to find champagn chilling in ice with glasses and box of chocolates and a beautiful flowering plant! We were thrilled and touched at the efforts this women and her staff and boss go to for their customers.We did breakfast a few times downstairs in the hotel. It was a nice little set up, with a toaster and bread, peanut butter and jelly. There were also some really delicious muffins and some other types of pasteries. The coffee was wonderful, there was hot tea and also pineapple juice. The lobby area was a great place to sit and sip your coffee and nibble on the yummy muffins.Grace, the front desk girl was very friendly and helpful. I was suprised that as many people they have in and out daily, she remembered my last name and we had not actually met. She was helpful to print out driving directions for us several times and had clean beach towels for us each day when we headed out.The location of the hotel was great.We had an ocean view room even though we didn't pay for one. That was nice.The beach is a 2 minute walk, and the ABC store right next to Ocean Tower. It is within walking distance of many great resturants and shops.Over all, our stay was a wonderful time for us. We had tons of fun all day long and then had a nice cool, clean room to come back to and relax. When it came time for us to check out, Leonor present us with handmade leis she had made for us. We were very touched. Then she handed us a little basket with more chocolates and macadamia nuts! She also sent me away with fresh baked banana bread too! We really felt special. This place is a people friendly place. They treat each guest as though they were the most special. I have never seen this high quality customer service before in my life!If you are looking for a place to stay that is close to the beach, this is it. This is the place to stay no matter what. I do know they are upgrading their rooms and we were able to see 2 of these finished rooms. Wow.This hotel is probably going to go up to a 4 star rating.When we return to Oahu oneday we will be staying with Ocean Tower. These are some special people and they are doing it right!
1	Great weekend in Chicago!. My husband and I absolutely loved our stay at Allegro. It was a great location, the staff was friendly and the room was fantastic. We paid for an upgrade once we got there and I'm so glad we did, the room was spacious and I slept like a rock! I would definitely stay there again. The only drawback is that everything around the hotel closes relatively early so make sure to grab dinner early or plan to go to another area of the city.Hey Natalieaz9!Thanks for the 5 star review!! I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed your upgraded room and slept like a rock! What's better than that! We hope to see you again soon!Rachel RodriguezFront Office Manager
1	The only place I will stay when flying out of Philadelphia. My husband and I stayed in the Hampton on October 20/21, 2012 as we were flying out of Philly on the 21st for a 15 day cruise. We love the Hampton and have never found the rooms or staff to be in any way deficient. Rooms are great and staff outstanding.Only upsetting thing - upon returning, we attempted to contact the hotel for the shuttle back to pick up our vehicle. Call 1 - answered, asked if I could be put on hold (done before I could answer), cut off - Call 2 - answered again, same thing, I said no, I've been put on hold and lost. Person said, I'me having a bad day..seriously. Calls 3, 4, 5 - rang up to 25 times and no answer. Finally, a young man answered and we were picked up by your great driver - this was November 7 at about 6:30 to 7:30 pm. (don't have exact time was irritated by this time).I would still stay here...would like to have the young lady answering calls to be talked to.
0	Bug found in my room!! YIKES!. There was a small black bug in my room by the bed. Manager-I don't know what kind of bug it is threw it in the trash. He shrugged his shoulders and said, there really isn't anything I can do for you.
1	Rita Tavares Eight nights stay for job relocation. I needed a place away from the airport noise and chose this hotel. The small kitchen with refrigerator is very convenient for someone like me that likes to save some money on food. The room was clean and the employees super nice. I recommend anyone to stay here!We appreciate you taking the time to share your experience and for choosing to stay with us. I'm so pleased to hear that you valued the fully equipped kitchen in your room, the cleanliness of your room, and your overall stay at our hotel. The staff and I would like to thank you again for posting your review. We look forward to welcoming you back in the future!
1	Great location, room, and price. My wife and I stayed at the Drury on Poydras on Friday night before the Jazz Half Marathon. We had stayed at the Drury before and enjoyed it very much. This time was no different. The hotel is clean and comfortable with a large inviting lobby. The have adopted valet-only parking which at 25 is expensive, but in line with other hotels in the area. The valets were very helpful and the service was excellent. The hotel offers a complimentary evening happy hour and breakfast with rather good food. We had a corner room, which was not a suite, but very spacious with a whirlpool bath. The room was comfortable, quiet, and had a nice view. The Drury is located at the edge of the French Quarter and provides easy access to the major sites. We had the added benefit of being only 1 block from the race start line at Lafayette Square. Overall, this is a fantastic place to stay in NOLA.
1	Best Place in Pacific Beach. I stayed at Ocean Park Inn in 2008 and 2009. I walked up and down the boardwalk and I don't feel there is a better place to stay. I was on the 3rd floor with an ocean view each time. It is breathtaking at sunset.The hotel was in the process of upgrades during my last stay. My room had not been updated yet - it was in dire need of new bedding I will admit. The bed was quite uncomfortable. The TV was out dated - they were replacing them with wall mounted flat screens however. They were also painting all of the hallways - I see someone mentioned the hallways were not air conditioned - I don't spend time in the hallway, so I don't see why this would matter - I never noticed the hallways being uncomfortable.I used the pool area quite a bit to tan, and was usually the only one there. Pool area is great.I have read some reviews stating that the management and staff were rude, that the area is noisy, and there are people hanging around the hotel. I had absolutely no problems with any of the staff on either of my stays. Each one was consistently helpful, courteous - almost to a fault!, and friendly. Jay, Chanel, Patrick, Sachin and Karelia - made my stay all the more enjoyable. The hotel is on the Pacific Beach boardwalk - there is noise. There are people on the boardwalk, rollerblading, skateboarding, biking, walking and jogging from early morning to evening. The beach is also immediately off the boardwalk - what do people expect! For there to be no one on the beach and no one on the boardwalk If you want quiet and solitude, stay on an island. It's Pacific Beach, it's a beach community - it is what it is. I never found the noise to be over-whelming and slept with my slider open every nite.Yes, there are a number of homeless that stay directly in front of the hotel on the boardwalk - they keep to themselves and don't bother anyone. I never saw them approach anyone at any time. They are gone by early evening. Traveling alone, I never felt afraid to be near them at any time-in fact I talked to some of them. They are harmless. T The continental breakfast changed last year and didn't offer as much as it did the year before (there were waffle makers the year before). However, there were several varieties of fresh bagels, packaged pastries, toast, butter, jelly's, cream cheese, fresh fruits, cereals, coffee, juice and milk. Just like any other continental breakfast FOR FREE. I'm just not sure what people expect. It was quite adequate. I would rather not have a full breakfast offered in lieu of keeping costs down.Again, having walked up and down the boardwalk, there are some really trashy places to stay - including the Best Western that are old, outdated, filthy and run down. Yes, there are a few nicer places like Tower 23 but the cost is also considerably higher. For the money, location, rooms and staff, I can't think of a better place to stay while in Pacific Beach or the San Diego area.
1	Excellent. The hotel is historic and yet modern. Full of history. The hotel is conveniently located in the heart of New Orleans. Blocks from the French Quater and the Riverfront. The staff was very courtis and very knowledgeable. Always there to help get you where you want to be. Just one block to Mothers one of the local best restaurants. Totally enjoyed my stay On behalf of the staff at the Whitney Hotel, thank you so much for your recent visit and for the wonderful review. We'll share your praise with our staff and sincerely hope we'll get to see you again soon. Thank you, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
0	Don't stay here. First we booked the hotel using hotels.com it had 2 stars which was fine since we just needed a quick place to sleep so we could go back to universal studios in the morning. We were not expecting much but what we got was so much worse. When we went to check in we had to give them an extra... More
0	Bad Management. Good place, good setting, bad management. The property manager will lie, cheat and steal. Be sure to keep your valuables locked in your car. Better yet, find a different place. There are many nice hotels in Prescott.
0	The worst hotel I had, ever..... I traveled a lot and this is the worst hotel I had. Stench until I see a whole wall rotten. Changing room ... Then the new room had flies, living and dead everywhere. The air conditioning was full of dead insects and dust. Bathroom, spiders, caterpillars and Sallete. We disinfected before use.
0	Travel back in time. Hotel was probably built in the 50's. Needs serious update. Not really clean but not too terribly filthy. Landscaping was nice in the garden area and the pool was fairly nice but showed its age. The plus side is that you are literally steps away from the beach.

0	All they want is your money. I'm not sure why this place gets such good reviews because there are other places in Napa that are so much better, see my other reviews.1. They charge your card before you ever arrive. Not just reserve the money but charge the card. 2. A 72 hour cancellation policy (ridiculous) and they never answer the phones so canceling is impossible anyway. 3. Would not honor Google offers coupon. 4. Blinds do not block the light so your up at 6 whether you like it or not. 5. Noisy street. The only reason this got 2 stars is the room is new and clean but I would never stay here again!
1	Friendliness In A Strange Town At It's Best!!!. I have no idea what all the complaints are about with this vintage, friendly, accomodating,centrally located Inn. From Ken, who was sitting outside at 7:30 a.m. in the morning when Iarrived and waited til I checked in to even carry my bag upstairs and absolutely refused totake a tip from me, to T. J., who by telephone was able to change my room and was sovery friendly at check-in and check-out and even offered to lock up my luggage aftercheck out time. They are both keepers and with a small inconvenience of deluxe roomsit was worth it to meet these kind of people in a big city environment where people aremore concerned about the almighty dollar than treating people with cordiality. My experiencein Atlanta will be remembered because I decided to stay at the Highland Inn instead of ahotel chain. Keep up the great atmostphere and positive greetings and helpfulness toyour guests! Much Appreciated.Wow! Thank you for your 5-star review. We really appreciate you sharing your experience with potential guests and for the kind words about our location and staff! I will be sure to share your praises with them. Please stay with us again the next time you are in the area!Best wishes, Kristin Anderson Assistant Hotel ManagerThe Highland Inn
1	Great rest and relax. It was great to include the small gym. My only complaint was with breakfast. If you offer service until 9am. Then it should remain fully stocked until 9am not short the main items: eggs, bacon, and sausage.When I asked at 8:45 if they bring out more eggs, bacon or sausage I was told no because it was too close to 9am.William Thank you for taking the time to express your feeling regarding your stay at our location. Our free daily breakfast is a great selling point for our customers. I will meet with my staff on Friday and review your comments and concerns. Please feel free to contact us on your next trip to the Atlanta market.Willis Blake DOS
0	Consistently bad service that left us hungry for some decent hospitality. We had high hopes for the Aria - during our Christmas mini-getaway we chose it over several competing hotels due to its promise of a newer hotel with great service and amenities. We arrived at around 11:30 pm and were surprised to find a long winding line at the check in area. The line moved at an excruciatingly slow pace... More
1	What a great place for kids, exceptional offstrip value. With the movie theater, kids babysitter facility,bowling alley, swimming pool, casino, etc this was a very nice place, only 15 minutes from the strip. kid friendly swimming pool (which also had a pretty lively weeklly adult pool party) was nice. large clean rooms accomodated 4 people easily. the st tropez buffet food was very good and moderately pricedwe would definitely stay there again. a large shopping mall and other stores are less than 5 minutes away. beatiful view of both the strip at night and the mountains from our room. we also looked out over the pool area and a golf coursethe fitness center was just that. not a bike and treadmill like some places. they had treadmills, elliptical trainers and bikes as well as several weight machinesspa on site but i didnt get to try it out unfortunatelygive it a try and i know you wont be disappointed
1	Good hotel but crummy TV. This is the largest Hilton Garden Inn I've ever stayed in, 8 floors. Not far from Love Field, so quite convenient. Hotel shuttle driver picked me up at the airport and was very nice and accommodating. Front desk checking in seemed a little inexperienced, but got the job done. Restaurant was very good, server was outstanding. Only a few of the TV channels are in HD, I was quite surprised they haven't upgraded to better reception. Upon checkout, front desk was incredibly helpful in assisting me to get an UBER ride. I'd stay here again just for the outstanding staff.We would like to thank you for your review we have recently hired new guest agents to our staff who are still in their training period but still I would like to apologize for the less than great experience. We would love to service you again.Thanks,
1	Great visit and quite area. The hotel was very well kept and in a quite and safe area. The hotel is resort style so the propery is several different buildings tied together with courtyards. The outdoor pool area was clean and well kept. The rooms were standard but very nice. The entire property felt very authentic with the local area. Also, having a restaurant right on property was very convienent. All of the local restaurants and shops were easily within walking distance. If we visit San Diego again we will definitely stay here! Thank you for taking time to leave a glowing review of your experience. This is the kind of excellent description that really helps travels planners get a sense of all we offer. Were glad that you enjoyed our vintage California style as well as the cuisine at our rooftop restaurant, Old Town Tequila Factory. For those planning travel on a weekend, Ill mention their excellent Saturday and Sunday brunches! We hope youll get the opportunity to return. Remember to book direct for the best rates and any specials we have going on. Until then - safe travels! Regards,Ryan AguinaldoGeneral Manager

The room we reserved was not available, so for 3 people we did not receive 2 queen beds but rather a king bed and a disgusting roll away. The pillows were wimpy, lumpy, and worthy of the trash. The sheets were not percale, nor sateen, nor crisp cotton, instead they... More
1	Classic style and service. Attention to detail was incredible at one of New York City's finest hotels.Our suite was beautiful, and despite being worried about traffic noise, we were surprised to have had a very restful night. We used travel points to book our room, and were very impressed to have been upgraded to a better room - this is excellent service and excellent recognition that people who travel all the time rarely cash in their points, but when they do ... it leaves a lasting impression and a very much increased likelihood that we will return and also highly recommend.Well done!Dear SuenearBoston, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor. We hope to see you again soon!Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager
1	Perfect location. First, let me say.. Location, location, location. Close enough to everything, yet far enough for some peace and sleep.Room was clean, beds were comfortable, reception staff pleasant, helpful and accommodating. Breakfast was just something to hold you over until lunch, but nothing more. Would definitely stay again.Only con was that the water pressure wasn't great, but with the cold front we had this week, a little extra time in the warm water was just fine.They had some work being done and water was turned off one day, but we checked out the next morning.Dear Guest,Thank you for your review and the kind words about the staff. I apologize for the water issues you encountered during your stay and will use your comments to better the experience for future guests. Your feedback is crucial to improving our hospitality and we look forward to being able to serve you again in the near future.
1	simple hotel that meets all your needs. I highly recommend this hotel as a place to stay. It's situated in Arlington a quieter,more idealic area than Washington dc itself although still very easy to visit all the attractions in DC via a short walk to Rosslyn, it's nearest metro.Hotel room was amazing value for money,very clean with a separate kitchen area.There is no hotel restaurant available and thekitchen was more than adequate to cook decent meals in. Our only complaint is that our gas cooker did not work and after mentioning it to the hotel it was never sorted out so we spent 2 weeks without a working cooker.As there is not much in the surrounding area we found ourselves having to travel into rosslyn and Washington to buy dinner.
1	Great spa. Our spa experience here was wonderful. We had massages, facial, and mini manicures. Michelle, the massage therapist did a great job with the deep tissue massage. Juliette, at the desk, was extremely helpful in helping us determine what services to choose. She patiently answered all of our questions, showed us around and explained how their facility worked. The atmosphere was great - relaxing and calm.Dear Jodie U,Thank you for choosing The Spa at Estancia. It's a delight to know that you had an exceptional experience, enjoying the hospitality and expertise of our staff and our tranquil atmosphere. We truly appreciate the excellent rating you have awarded us and we hope to welcome you back to Estancia soon.
0	Motel turned hotel. Walked in to the room and was greeted by an overpowering stench of disinfectant. We opened all the windows but it took several days for the smell to disappear. Ceilings are extremely thin and so you hear anyone walking around upstairs well into the late hours of the night. Every morning, we found broken glass in the parking lot, probably from a late night patron of the breakfast joint next door. For 240 bucks per night, I would have expected far less problems. I shared these issues with the front desk and they said they would put us in an upstairs room on our next visit. This is obviously an old motel turned into a Best Western. We won't be back.Thank you for completing the survey regarding your recent stay at our property. On behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you gave us to implement improvements to ensure we offer a better experience for guests in the future. We have always been a Best Western and have just gone through a 100 remodel of our property I hope that you will consider staying with us again so that we can have another chance to provide you with a superior experience.
1	Best economy hotel ever stayed in. The hotel is an economy hotel but it was one of the best my spouse and I stayed in. Everyone was very friendly. Upon arrival to my room, the receptionist called and make sure everything was OK. I do not even get this kind of service at high end hotels. So Kudos to the level of service. The hotel was clean and comfortable. The location is roughly 30-45 min drive to DC depending on traffic. The swimming pool was only 6pm-10pm on weekdays and only a few hours on weekends. So If you plan to use the pool you really have to plan for it. Overall my experience for this hotel was very nice.
1	Very Close to SubTrust Park. I booking online for Opening Day for the Braves. Originally I was going to stay at a Hyatt or the Holiday in but they wanted 170 a night and the walk (checked it out on google earth). So I decided to checkout Priceline like I normally do and they had a 4 star hotel for 85 a night so I risked it and it payed off. We stayed in Room 1018 and it was clean and nicely updated. The only complaint I had was the door gaps are kinda loose and you can hear all the noise from the ground floor. The beds were very comfortable.Now the walk wasn't bad we cut threw the shops and it was a easy 10 minuets walk. The pedestrian bridge wasn't finished but it had plenty of room for all the walking fans. The nights we went the Doors the the Galleria Mall were unlocked. The area seemed safe. Now when we ran to Walmart there was a couple places that looked run down but it looks like that should change in the near future. Now for parking we did valet but the self parking lot never looked to be completely full. I did that not knowing how parking would be since it was the First game at SunTrust. I will definitely stay again unless I can get a better deal on a hotel (the Hampton, Omni etc) that are in the heart of the battery but I doubt that will ever happen. Thank you for staying with us! We look forward to your return.
0	Clean but Smelly. This hotel needs a better ventilation system!! The whole place smelled of smoke and farts. I found the casino to be very dreary and outdated. The rooms were very clean and we had a nice view. We had breakfast there and the smell of smoke permeated the restaurant so bad it was hard to eat. I wouldn't stay here again, for sure.
0	Las Vegas. Chose this location because of event attending. Had good experiences with Hampton in the past at other locations. This was not a good experience. No hot water, boiled eggs tasted like onions. Staff polite and very nice. Compensated for no hot water in rate reduction. Not worth the higher price rate for a night's stay.
1	Amazing hotel. The hotel is one of the best hotels I have stayed in. The location is great and you can easily walk to all the main attractions. It is right by the river which is a nice view. The room was really modern and clean. There was a coffee machine in the room and the hotel provided complementary fruits and soda and water. The staff were really friendly and helpful. I would defiantly go back there and highly recommend it.Thank you, Alex F, for choosing the River Hotel and for taking the time to post a review. We are thrilled to know you enjoyed the accommodations, prime location and friendly staff. We sincerely appreciate your high recommendation and we look forward to seeing you on your next visit!
1	Good Time in Waikiki. My wife and I had a very nice time in Waikiki. We wanted to have a good time and not spend too much money. We booked a standard room at the Ocean Tower Hotel. Renovations are going on now to upgrade all the rooms. Our first room was clean and met our needs. But one night we had a small problem with a sprinkler in our room. To take care of the problem we were given a deluxe ocean view room for the same price. This made the vacation so much nicer, getting up in the morning and looking at the ocean. I have Leonor Wong to thank for this and many other things she did to make are stay so nice. When we go back to Waikiki we will stay at the Ocean Tower Hotel.
0	The Name Says it All. Econolodge it is. It was cheap in price, and accommodations as well. Rooms looks just like what the name implies an old roadside motor lodge.

1	More than expected!. It was my first time staying with aloft but now it has become my top choices. The location was great and accessible to trolleys and within walking distance to many spots. The room was well decorated with many chargers. Front desk was really helpful and friendly. The only problem is the terrible sound insulation that I could hear my next door clearly. Many leisures in hotel but I was too busy to explore. Definitely coming back for my next stay in Philly.Hi Jane, We are thrilled you're coming back to Philly and of course our hotel!!! The FIVE BUBBLE review is much appreciated!!! Everyone needs to stay powered up. Thanks for noticing how we placed USB ports all over the hotel!! Bedside in two locations, on the desk, under the W XYZ Bar and throughout the lobby areas. We want to be sure your connected and in touch!Can't wait to have you back! Thank you for your business!Evan
1	6 Night Stay In Seattle. Great location and close to pretty much everything.What can you say really Room was great, spacious clean and well stocked, Bed was ultra comfortable and bathroom towels and amenities were all spot on. Only complaint could be that the T.V was very small compared to the standard of the room.Staff were great and always on point.I used the Hyatt Gym everyday and found it to be immaculate and never tooo busy.Only bummer was to pay for internet but at check out the lady asked if I wanted to join up to the Hyatt gold scheme and I did and then the internet was free but unless I had done that the internet was not free which considering the normal rate of the rooms is a little bit much in my opinion. On the subject of cost, I was on a discounted room rate but if I did take the going rate....all I can say is that if you want quality like this....expect to pay for it.Me and my girlfriend enjoyed and were comfortable every minute we were in the hotel.Thank you so much for your review. We're so glad that you enjoyed your stay with us. Your comfort and happiness are our main priorities and it's wonderful that the amenities, location and features of the room made your stay a good one. We look forward to welcoming you back on your next visit to Seattle.Sarah S.Guest Relations Manager
1	Exceptional value in SF. Our family loved the Orchard Garden Hotel. Starting with Joe's warm welcome at the door, we knew we going to be looked after, and weren't disappointed the whole stay. Our room was spacious and absolutely immaculate. The hotel's location is great for a walk to Chinatown or Union Square. Basic breakfast options, but top-notch freshness and quality. All of the staff were friendly and professional, and they even ensured our bedding was arranged the way we liked it. We appreciated getting helpful tips on getting around SF via the Muni, as well as restaurant suggestions. This hotel is one of the best we've visited in CA, but extraordinarily good value for SF in the location.Wow, Bernard -- hearing that you felt so welcomed and well taken care of within minutes of walking through our doors is incredibly gratifying! I'm so thrilled to know you had a blast while staying with us and enjoying this lovely city we call home. Whenever you're traveling back to San Francisco, I hope we'll be lucky enough to host you again!Take care,Collins C., Front Office Manager
1	Great Stay. I had a wonderful stay at this hotel. From the time I arrived the customer service I received has been nothing less of truly amazing. All the way from the staff that checked me in to the staff at the bar during happy hour. The shuttles are great if you dont have a car they will take you to/from the airport, to/from the mall and anywhere requested within a mile radius of the airport. The room its self can use a bathroom update but overall not too bad. The breakfast was great with cooked to order omelets. This hotel was worth every penny.
1	Marriott's Pulse, vibrating!. This is a really modern hotel bang, smack in the centre of the great city of San Diego, California. And because it has most of anything you need at pretty high quality, it is not cheap. We stayed for two days and enjoyed both beertasting and whiskey/whiskytasting for only 5 each. The bartenders, John and Ben, did a fine job! Breakfast is not included, but it's not very expensive and you have lots of choices. We didn't try the restaurant. They served us good hashbrowns and perfect eggs which were impressively fast on our table. Good selection of teas and real freshly squeezed orangejuice. Staff looks happy, not just polite. Great room, loved the chocolate! Fine beds, fridge and microwave in the livingroom and tv both there and in the bedroom. Modern fascilities for charging phones etc. Even if you need an extra plug, it's already there. Any niggles Well, parking in cities may be difficult, but 42 per night with valet and 35 without seems to me a bit over the top, the room comes at a price so it ought to be half the price for guests. After all, just a few blocks up you could park for free on the street. But will I stay there again if in SD Yes, of course.Thank you for your review and for taking the time to let us know about your stay! We are happy you had a great visit to the resort and look forward to more vacationgreatness with your family.
0	Worst service ever! Paid boutique prices for mid-level hotel.. We have been very happy at Joie de Vivre hotels in SF and could not have been more dissapointed by this experience. We had trouble from the start--rude front desk staff, bellmen who never even attempted to help with baggage, problems with the bill and double charging our credit card, mishandled arrangments with the airport pick-up, and a very sub-standard room for a steep price (nearly 400/night). We ultimately got an upgrade since we were paying too much for such a small room (and are members of JdV), but the damage was done by the rude front desk service and general incompetence. A good thing: The housekeepers are nice. The hotel doesn't offer the services that a hotel charging these prices should have--for example, they have limited room service (none on weekend mornings), no concierge , terrible gym, etc. Do yourself a favor and stay someplace else!I would like to start by thanking you for taking time to write and provide feedback about your recent stay. However, I am very sorry your experience was completely unfavorable. We truly pride ourselves in quality customer service, as one might read from many of the other TripAdvisor postings, and clearly fell short of delivering the consistent wonderful service that many of our Joie de Vivre members and other guests experience. Please feel free to contact the hotel directly so that I may find a way to resolve and change your opinion as I truly care about how you feel. Thanks so much for hopefully giving us a chance to make a potential future stay better and let us show you that we can do it right. Sincerely, Paul Frentsos, General Manager. 415-835-6473 direct number.
0	Consider a better hotel. Try to avoid unless you absolutely have to.
1	Great location. This hotel was great. The staff was genuinely nice and helpful. My boyfriend and I came for a trip to the Verizon Center to catch a Wizards game. The Verizon Center was not far at all. I called front desk for a cab and had one in about 5 minutes. The room was clean and nice. I'm a bit of a germaphobic and I had no problem with it. I didn't spot one dirty spot or anything. When we first got in the room there was a problem with the heat. Maintenance came and fixed it quickly and all was well. If I had to list one improvement it would be that the furniture looks a little outdated. But it was not really a problem. It didn't look dirty or run down, just not fashionable. Other than that, this hotel was wonderful. It was in a great location to restaurants and DC and I would absolutely stay here again.
1	Great Time.. We had a wonderful time at the Estancia La Jolla. We had never stayed there before, and it was so great. As we arrived they offered us sparkling wine and water, took us to our room which was lovely, and showed us around. We took advantage of the free arrival margaritas, as low point, as I think they forgot the tequila!, but it was a nice offer. We also used the jacuzzi which was clean and nice in the evening with candles and a fire in the pool area. Everyone was super friendly, and the facilities were great, although they were being re-modeled at the time, which wasn't the best. We ate at Adobe El Restaurante for breakfast which was absolutely delightful. We would definitely recommend a visit to this charming hotel.Thank you for taking the time to write such a fantastic review. Im glad you had a chance to enjoy things like the whirlpool and breakfast in Adobe El Restaurante. You will have to come back and visit the Spa next time, it is going to look great after the enhancement project is complete in just a couple more weeks!
0	The most humiliating hotel experience. On my most recent work trip to NYC, I chose to stay at the St Regis vs my usual (The Peninsula). Never again will I go back. After a long day of client meetings, I decided to grab a light dinner and drink at the hotel lobby bar (King Cole Bar). I travel quite a bit for work and my one rule of thumb is to avoid being holed up in a room with room service. I headed straight to the bar after getting back to the hotel and intentionally grabbed a small table in the far corner as I knew I'd need to get some work in to clear all my emails from the day. Literally within 15 seconds of powering on my laptop, one of the servers bolted over to me and asked if I was aware that they had a No Laptop Policy after 4pm. Seriously I had to ask myself, was I really staying at a 5-star business property I politely pushed back and said I was a guest at the hotel and had to get some work done and would be out of there quickly after my meal. He looked annoyed but then retreated.Fast forward 15-20 minutes...my food and wine arrives and I'm not even halfway through. That's when the FB manager then approaches me. He actually had the audacity to ask how much longer will I be on my laptop as I am being disruptive. Again, to set the context, I am sitting in the far corner next to a pillar and had my laptop screen dimmed to the lowest setting. I am not engaging with anyone yet I'm being disruptive One would think an FB manager would have some business and common sense and decency to recognize that you don't go and ask a paying guest at the hotel to get up in the middle of a meal because they are working on their laptop. When I told him I didn't understand their policy and why he was enforcing it, he said I was not fitting in to the bar scene. Unbelievable. He then tells me he'd be happy to have my food and wine moved outside the bar where I could freely work. I am at this point just dumbfounded. It was like being asked to move to the back of the bus or get off the bus for that matter. Most humiliating and distasteful experience ever and never ever would I have imagined it would be on a work trip at what's supposed to be an upstanding hotel. And just to be clear, on the many occasions I've had to power up my laptop at the bar at The Peninsula to get some work done, not once did anyone ask me to turn off my laptop or leave. Crystal clear for me now...Dear sfellelle, On behalf of the Management team at The St. Regis New York, we would like to thank you for your visit. We appreciate you taking the time to detail your recent stay at our property.Our hotel prides itself on providing five star service, yet in some cases, mistakes can occur. We apologize for the experience that you encountered in our Food and Beverage department, and please know that this is certainly not our standard. Rest assured, we took the necessary measures to do an internal follow up with our staff to ensure that all our guests have a flawless experience in our bar in the future in similar circumstances.We most certainly hope you will give us another opportunity to service you again in the future. Please don't hesitate to contact me directly to book your next visit or to discuss in length your experience at: Octavia.margineanstregis.com. Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager

Room very clean and huge, bed and pillows very comfy had a brilliant sleep every night. Breakfast excellent with loads to choose from. Only downfall no Pool. I would definitely stay here again when I come to Seattle. We're happy to hear you enjoyed your stay with us during your time in Seattle. We do our best to meet all of our guest's needs, and the staff will be happy to hear they met all of your expectations.We hope that you will stay with us again during your future travels.Thanks so much,

1	Fantastic hotel experience. This was one of the best hotel experiences I have had in a while. The industrial design is funky and interesting - much better than the blandness of big hotel chains. The eclectic art gives it an edge. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble. The rooms were large, well laid out and well appointed. I would not hesitate to stay again or recommend it to friends.Mary-Anne, thank you so much for this amazing review. We are happy to you had a great stay and we look forward to welcoming you again.
0	Dissappointed. The bathroom stunk. Carpet dirty. The front clerk was not very nice. Restaurant closed early. Snow plowing was poor and the person plowing was not paying attention very well.
1	Every stay better than the last. Well ion advance of our trip out west Mariah at the concierge desk set us up for the best trip possible. She'd helped us some years ago and when I emailed I wasn't sure she'd still be there. Not only did she respond but she also remembered us and was more than helpful and available both in advance of the trip and during. Also Selena and Alexandre (who remembered us from his time at the St Regis NY) were of great help!Also Tatianna and Abhishek with the butler department, Eric at the bar, Irma a the front desk, Freddo at the front door and Linh at the Spa. You will love the place and love the people.
1	Overall great place to stay near town/beach. Overall very pleased with hotel. Though there technically was plenty of space, the porta-crib barely fit between the beds. Room was very clean. Liked having the fridge. Bathroom clean. Wifi worked well. Good selection of tv channels, though we didn't watch it too often. Maid did go in one day while we were out despite the do not disturb sign being on door, which makes me uncomfortable, but it was all good. Breakfast was nice in having many choices. Area wasn't first choice, but we weren't going to pay those prices. Convenient to most everything we wanted to do.
0	Not so great. Room was clean, breakfast was OK and the desk clerks were friendly. Now for the bad: My daughter tried putting brown sugar on her oatmeal and it was solid like a rock in the shaker.The juice machine was covered with fruit flies and the lady tending to the food was rude when we accidentally dropped some food on the floor stating she would be the one cleaning it up later. The 3rd floor hall was like an ice box due to remodeling. The heater in the room did not work properly. The pool was closed for renovations.The vending machine was almost completely out of food. Thanks for a horrible experience. It will be a cold day in Hades before Holiday Inn gets my hard earned money again.
1	Come for the Hotel, Stay for the Art. The Found:Re is a unique hotel is special city: part hotel, part Art gallery, this is one fun place to stay. My wife and I love it for it's ever changing, with new works of Art installed regularly. The property is centrally located, features a nice restaurant, Match, and is just across the street from FEZ, one of favorite eateries outside the hotel proper. The Found:Re is also a short walk from the Phoenix Art Museum, which is on par with some of the best in San Francisco, Denver, Chicago, and New York.We appreciate the kind words! We look forward to seeing you again!
0	If not for location, do not choose this one. I have been in multiple Days Inn properties and I like them. This one is not among them. I picked this one as of proximity of my meeting location - I now wish I should have choose something else.Confusing floor plan spread across 2 different buildings. Hanging stuff in bathroom, you cant understand weather you have open or shut a tap. Either you get too cold water or too hot water. No breakfast at all - there is buffet you can pay but that is just OK. Inconsistent WiFi and bad room lightning. Staff are good - but they are overloaded. Hence very little time for checking with you.

0	Not Impressed. This is not an attractive hotel. It is an old hotel. There were spider webs near the sink. There was mold inside of the restroom (near the shower). There was no microwave or refrigerator. I was told to go downstairs to get extra towels. There were a lot of human noise outside during the night. Prostitutes seem to be roaming on the property. During checkout, the guy at the front desk seemed nonchalant when questions were asked.
1	Great!. We just returned from a three night stay at this hotel. We loved it. Public transportation is right out the front door (bus and streetcar). If you'd rather walk, just head strait down Carondelet - it turns into Bourbon when you cross Canal (6 blocks).Hot breakfast is provided every morning in the lobby. On Sun-Thur, each adult guest receives three complimentary evening cocktails in the lobby.The rooftop pool is small, as is the fitness center.The lobby is beautiful, with marble floors and nice chandeliers. We stayed in a king suite, and it had tons of space, although the bathroom area seemed small. Our teenaged nephew slept on the pull-out sofa, and appreciated all the room he had to spread out. He also appreciated that we had our own tv in the bedroom, so he could have control over the one in the living room. He loved the free internet access, but didn't love the TONS of pop-up ads that came along with it.The king suite had:One bedroom with king bed, two night stands with lamps, entertainment center with television, telephone, and closet. Living area with pull-out sofa, chair, recliner, coffee table, entertainment center with television, refrigerator, and microwave (2 free soft drinks and microwave popcorn provided), and desk area with internet access.The vanity area had another closet, as well as a coffee maker. Parking is 13 a day, which is a bargain. The lot is self-park, no valet, so you have access to your car whenever you need it.Make sure your room key is always handy. You need it to get in and out of the parking area, to use the elevators, and to get into the back entrance (all day) or the lobby entrance (after hours).This was our third trip to New Orleans, and our first stay at the Drury. I think we'll stay here again.
0	HORRIBLE - DO NOT STAY HERE. carpets disgusting. Blood on back of front door. front desk staff was not helpful nor friendly. No housekeeping. Had to keep asking for a roll of toilet paper every day. Looks like people are living there. non-smoking room smelled musty of smoke.Please accept our sincere apologies for not living up to your expectations. We strive to provide wonderful hospitality to all of our guests, but we obviously let you down. Your feedback is of utmost value, and we will use it as a training tool to improve our performance moving forward. Please consider giving us another opportunity to restore a favorable impression of our hotel in the future.Sincerely,Hotel Management
1	Amazing Hotel. This hotel was amazing,I'm so glade we ended up going with this one.The location is great it is only a minutes walk to the strip with all the restaurants and the beach,and the bus stop is also right there too. The Hotel may not be on the beach line, but it doesn't need to be as it feels so close.Would certainly stay there again. Aloha Kevin G!Thank you for choosing to stay with us at the Shoreline during your recent vacation. We're happy that the hotels centralized location worked well for you and the activities that you had during your stay being that we are just a stones throw away from the beach and Waikikis shops and restaurants. We hope to see you again the next time you visit Oahu.Mahalo,Daniel FlorenFront Office Manager
1	Only needed a bed but got an experience instead. I 'crashed' here after an event, so I had done no research like I would have for a getaway. The location was perfect, the room small but stylish, the bathroom classic and efficient. Our bed wasn't as soft as I needed, but I got a decent night's sleep. After a very late night, we woke to a view of the Lincoln Park Zoo and Lake Michigan. We walked the neighborhood, enjoying the people, sights, scents, and vibe of Lincoln Park. I had zero expectations when I checked in, and definitely found myself wishing we were staying a few more days. The decor was classic and a bit whimsical. I loved it!
1	Great hotel with a nice not so crowded beach.. The hotel staff were very helpful and courteous. The room was clean and had plenty of room for our family of 4. Not immediately in the highly commercial area which we loved. The beach on the Chesapeake Bay wasn't extremely crowded which was a bonus. They have very nice hotel ammenities including an indoor outdoor pool, hot tub, semi private beach, water activities, kids camps, etc. We had the opportunity to hear a live band in the restaurant too. Food Lion right across the street and only a short drive to the more commercialized area. We loved it and would definitely stay there again.
0	Ramada. Breakfast the first morning had molded bagels and fruit. I would check the food before you eat it.
1	Room rating. Room very very small, no view. Sink was clogged not enough towels when we arrived but was fixed right away when brought to your attention. A safe would have been nice. 655 for 2 days (includes valet parking) was pricey for what we are used to, otherwise we enjoyed our stay. Staff was excellent room nice clean. Great air conditioning.Thank you for staying at the River Hotel. We appreciate your candid feedback about your experience. I apologize for the issues you experienced initially, but am happy to know the team responded appropriately. Please know we have many room types and sizes available I hope you will book a larger room and try us again on your next trip.Thank you again!
1	Nicely priced boutique hotel with great bed and a goldfish.. The Pearl has modern decor but no attitude. We stayed one night, a Sunday, and though it's on a busy street, it was very quiet. The bed was super comfy (making us wish we had stayed more than one night). Willy the fish (a fishbowl with a goldfish is mounted above eye level on the wall by the window) was a nice touch. I didn't know about the 10 parking charge, but there's plenty of neighborhood parking. Also, this was a great way to avoid the downtown/Gaslamp district party scene and expensive parking. I also was concerned about possible airport noise, but there was none. I go to San Diego a lot and am looking forward to staying at The Pearl in the future.
0	Vastly overpriced. I was charged 244 for a one night stay in a very average room, I expected far better for the price sadly this is a similar standard of a holiday inn or days inn who are far cheaper. Staff were friendly enough, reception appeared to be under construction, I shall not be using this Marriott againThank you for your recent comments regarding the hotel. I understand the importance of receiving a value of staying in a downtown hotel, and Im sorry you didnt feel you received that value while staying in the hotel. At this time, the hotel is undergoing a major re-imaging of the lobby space and exterior with additional plans to begin the rooms and fitness area. Once this is completed, I hope you will give us another opportunity so you may see the value of the location and to gain your loyalty. Thank you again for your feedback.
1	I so wanted to love this hotel.... The overall experience of staying 2 nights at the hotel was pleasant. Loved the location next to Old Town and the fact once we parked we never had to use our car until check out. A huge plus for my travel party. The shuttle driver was so nice and courteous and punctual. the room was ok as our room view was not what we desired.. I wanted a view of the city/ or bay, instead it was inside the courtyard. But beds and and room was decent. Breakfast was good served at the restaurant, that had a variety of offerings for all. The complaint I have was the Hot Tub, which was luke warm. We were very disappointed at the lack of heat of the spa. That was supposed to be relaxing and refreshing, instead it was like murky coldish bath water. I so wanted to love the hotel for future stays...Greetings, and thank you for your feedback. Im glad to hear that you found our location convenient, room comfortable and shuttle driver friendly. My apologies for the hot tub. Were looking into what might have been the problem! Before your next visit, please call the front desk directly to explore all room location options. We want you to have the views you desire. Youll also get the best rates we offer. Thank you again for staying with us! Regards,Ryan AguinaldoGeneral Manager
0	No wi-fi connection in room! poor tv reception, river view across from ugly construction site. Stayed one night after visiting Smoky Mountain Natl Park. The bathroom is very small, with small vanity outside. There is refrig/micro oven and one cup size coffee maker. Biggest complain is there is NO internet connection at all in our room. We tried and tried, only has 1 bar and has no connection. Was watching college basketball, TV was all... More
1	Good stay. We had a very good stay at this hotel. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was good. I had been worried about the breakfast because I had seen some reviews that hated the warm up eggs and breakfast sandwiches but I thought they were just fine and there were a few other good options. The only thing that sucks about the warm up sandwiches is the waste it makes. Itd be nice if the wrappings were recyclable.The only negative thing I would say is that the rooms are showing a need for a deep clean. There is dirt accumulating in the corners and soap scum on the shower shelves. The room in general was clean but definitely showed signs of cleanliness neglect if that makes sense. Location is excellent for two reasons. 1) central to all of the attractions which makes everything super walkable and 2) right across the street from Reading Terminal which was awesome!
0	Just didn't work out well. our stay started off good enough: we were given a room above the parking garage gate which was noisy. They gladly moved us to another room which upon reviewing the bill after checkout, was more expensive and no one said anything at the time. The rooms have microwaves and refrigerators which is very convenient. Room service was actually some of the best service and food we've had at this level hotel. There is a design flaw in the rooms where the bathroom door is in the way of the front door and must remain closed according to OSHA or it will block the front door access. It has a spring loaded hinge to keep it closed. Simple solution: re-hinge the bath door to swing inward instead of out toward the front door. We ended up putting a bag in the door to hold it open. Hope OSHA doesn't find out. Maid service needs to be re-trained: I left a 10 tip for them on the bed and all it got me was my trash not emptied that day. Also, we had our door partially held open, with a do not disturb sign hung out for our guest to return and a maid walked straight in after one quick knock and no waiting! Hello Housekeeping Whatever happened to that phrase This could have been very embarrassing. And the the weird part: on our last evening we started smelling noxious odors from the bathroom...and I mean noxious. I ran water in all the traps, checked the fan and everything seemed to be ok. But the odor persisted. Called the front desk and they said there might be a plumber doing work somewhere causing the odor. No call back, no offer to relocate. The odor came and it went a few times but each time became more fowl. They credited our room for the night which I appreciated but that was it. This odor was in our clothes and our nostrils for days after checkout. They really should have comped our entire stay. Or come up to see what was going on, offered to move us to another room, something other than nothing unless we asked for a credit. Staff was entirely insensitive to our plight. Almost seemed routine. I would give them another try on the basis that I can't have two experiences like this or they'd be out of business.Thank you very much for taking the time to give feedback regarding your recent stay with us. Your feedback is invaluable to our success. I apologize that you experienced multiple issues during your stay. I can assure you that I will personally follow up on these issues to ensure they are corrected for future guests. If you can contact me directly at sarah.havilandhilton.com, I can look further into the situation with you. Again thank you for your time and I look forward to speaking with you further.
1	Great location but old dated rooms. I booked a city view room instead of courtyard but maybe that was a bad idea. Everyday we got woken up around 5-6am by ambulance or police or fire truck on the street (and we had a room on the 7th floor!!) We didn't use the pool so cannot comment on that. Location was close to Downtown and sea. Staff was sweet amd acknowledged our wedding anniversary and sent us bubble. Appreciate that. hellkitty, I am delighted you found our location ideal for seeing all the sites that our wonderful city has to offer. Its unfortunate to hear about the street noise affecting your sleep. There is a window vent that often gets left open and when that happens, the street noise is very noticeable. We look forward to welcoming you back for another anniversary getaway. Be Well, Alyssa TurowskiGeneral Manager
0	Not cleaned room. When I checked in late at night, there was two used tissue papers and another room key (may be used by other customer) under a pillow. I let the staff know next morning, but she asked me are you using double beds or single bed They recommended changing my room instead of apology. Women Staffs are not kind and room conditions are worse than other Hyatt places. Only the breakfast was not bad.
1	It's all about customer service. I've been coming to this hotel for years and keep coming back, as I've always had a great experience. My most recent trip was no exception. I was in town for one night for a funeral, so it was a stressful time. The staff went above and beyond and were very accommodating - Vincent, Tevin, Mario Jojit were exceptional, as was everyone else. This is always my go to hotel in San Francisco, as they never disappoint.Dear gregr0y,Thank you for staying with us at Kensington Park Hotel again. We are very happy to hear that you had a great experience and enjoyed your stay even during a stressful time. I will share your kind words with my team. We can't wait to see you again during your future visits to San Francisco. Thank you for sharing your experience with us!
1	St Patrick Day Dash Hotel. We stayed at this hotel for the St Patrick's Day Dash in Seattle due to its location. It is a nice hotel, right across the Space Needle. We stayed in a suite... it actually had a full kitchen! Including dishwasher, microwave, garbage disposal, etc... Perfect for a family staying for a few days. Our room was facing other rooms, so when you open your blinds, you will see all the other rooms... kinda creppy, so beware and request a room facing out to the street.The hotel server a hot breakfast and it was actually pretty good. Supervised me how good it was, I even went back for seconds. Hotel has parking... but spaces are very limited and very small.... so leave the Ford350 at home.All in all... excellent hotel and an excellent location.FMH60878,Thank you for taking the time to submit such pleasant comments about us at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown. We are so ecstatic to hear you enjoyed our fully equipped kitchen in room, morning breakfast spread, and unbeatable location next to the Space Needle. We look forward to hosting you in the future until then, happy travels!Sarah Junge
0	Avoid!. Late in the day after 11 hours of driving, along this stretch of I-29 there's few options so we chose the Desoto Inn. Big mistake. First, the non-smoking room we were assigned wreaked of smoke. Okay, change rooms. Our next room assignment had mold in the bathroom and ants on the a-c. That's enough negatives for anyone but we were... More
1	Awesome Hotel. First time visiting Hawaii and booked the Shoreline Hotel, I can't fault it at all position is awesome 2-7 min walk to everything you need from restaurants, shops, bars, beach etc... Stayed on the fourth floor, rooms are very clean and bed was so comfortable. Grab and go breakfast is great with muffins, bars, coffee, tea to go. Small issue with tv which was fixed in less than five minutes.Excellent staff always willing to help, with directions things to see made my first trip to Hawaii very easy and enjoyable. Big shout out to Yianni, who was very helpful with his knowledge around the island.Already planning my next trip and booking The Shoreline again.. Keep up the good work guys!!!Aloha!Thank you so much for taking the time to share your experience with us on TripAdvisor! We're thrilled you enjoyed your stay with us and I'm sure Yianni is tickled knowing he made a difference in your stay. When you're booking your next Hawaiian getaway, we hope you'll choose to stay with us again!Mahalo
0	Most terrible hotel experience.. The hotel I stayed is so-called a 3-star hotel, here was no hot water in my room and I couldn't take shower. Also the A/C in my room didn't work well either, and it cannot give me a comfortable temperature. Then I asked for additional blankets, but they said all were gone. Given such a bad situation, they said they... More
1	Nice rooms, no cellular reception. The St. Regis is located pretty conveniently if you have business in downtown SF. The rooms are very new and well appointed. Staff is generally helpful, but service could be better. For example, when I called the front desk to ask about internet access, they informed me it would be extra, even though I could have sworn it was included in my rate (it was). A key issue is there is absolutely zero cellular reception if you're on ATT. The hotel acknowledges this (obviously not their fault), so if you need blackberry access, forget about it.
1	Great family friendly stay. We stayed at the Ritz for 5 nights in a club levelSuite. Location was wonderful, right by Boston Common and multiple T stops. Service was wonderful, especially from the concierge, front desk and club lounge staff. Staff made my 4 young children feel special and they enjoyed the scavenger hunt and little toys provided. The room was lovely and well appointed though a little smaller than it appeared in the website. I would definitely stay here again when I Boston! In fact Im planning on a business trip to Cambridge soon and considering staying here and commuting.Dear mnmorange,So glad to hear you enjoyed your recent stay with your family at The Ritz-Carlton, Boston, with all of the city so easily accessible just outside our doors. It is wonderful to know that you and your children were well taken care of by the friendly and professional ladies and gentlemen throughout the hotel. Thank you for taking the time to comment on your visit. We hope you will return for that upcoming business trip - getting to Cambridge from the hotel is a breeze - as well as many more occasions, when it will be our sincere pleasure to welcome you back.Warmest regards,William P. Bunce, General Manager
0	Not recommended. I made the mistake of booking at the last minute and this was one of the only hotels available around the fishermans wharf area at the time. It was way overpriced and the staff wasn't helpful in the least. The room was relatively clean but the condition of the hotel was pretty bad. The area is very noisy and there wasn't much around within a short walking distance so having our kids with us meant that we either had to drive everywhere and pay huge parking fees. This is the first review I've ever written but I felt like I needed to say something about a place that (at the time) charged me 250 a night and delivered a room way worse than a motel 6.
1	Customer friendly. The hotel was nice and it was in a great location. Our room experienced a little outside noise due to the restaurant below, but the hotel staff was very apologetic. The train station and trolley is right around the corner. They don't give very good written directions if you want them, they tell you where something is and you just hope you don't forget what they said. Overall, very happy with our stay.Dear Shoney75,Thank you very much for your valuable feedback. I am thrilled that you had an enjoyable stay with us. We are always excited and eager to make recommendations for guests when exploring the city, but I do apologize for the lack of written directions throughout your excursions. I have shared your experience with our staff and we will make sure to be as thorough as possible in the future. We hope to welcome you back to the Hotel Abri when your travels return you to the vibrant city of San Francisco!Yours in hospitality,Rob Brehant, General Manager, on behalf of the entire Abri Team
1	Best Value in San Diego. Staying in San Diego Then go here, as its accessible to everything and you can walk to Old Town and restaraunts. This hotel is on a hillside, so if you can't handle doing stairs, then this may not be the place for you. However, the hillside affords nice vistas of San Diego. Great to have a margarita in the restaraunt and look down on Old Town. Weekends can be noisy due to party crowd in Old Town, but week days are quiet.Thank you for leaving impressions of your stay. The Old Town Tequila Factory is our new restaurant and indeed, offers panoramic views of San Diego. Many rooms at the hotel also offer great views. We look forward to your next stay! Happy Holidays!
0	Stay away!. My 13-year-old daughter and I were on a road trip and decided we wanted to stay overnight in this area, so I jumped online, found this listing, and made a reservation and told them we'd be there in an hour. When we pull up to...More
0	Respiratory Infection. The rooms are dingy and dirty. I have a respiratory infection from the AC unit and filth in the room. I would not stay at this hotel if at all possible. The carpets are old throughout and all of them are stained.This is not the impression we want to leave with our customers. I am truly sorry you fell ill while at our location. Being away from home makes being sick even more uncomfortable. I am happy we were able to work together to come to a satisfactory resolution. Please know that your feedback is taken very seriously.
1	Will stay again. Our recent stay at the Whitney was overwhelmingly nice. The hotel is housed in the historic old Whitney Bank Building. The reception desk was once the teller desk and the old vault is located in the lobby. Our suite was very large with two rooms. The master bedroom was quite spacious and was separated from the sitting area by French doors. The sitting area had a sofa bed it's own television. The bathroom was also very spacious. The hotel offers free internet as well as complimentary coffee. There is a restaurant located in the lobby. The staff was very helpful and courteous. The hotel is located right off of Saint Charles Avenue which is very convenient during Mardi Gras and only a half a mile from the French Quarter. I will be staying again!!!On behalf of the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans, thank you for your visit and kind words on TripAdvisor. We hope we'll get another opportunity to serve you again during your next trip to the Big Easy!Kindest Regards, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
0	WORST HOTEL EVER. I agree with all of the other reviews that say this hotel is shabby and run down. Staff are slow and totally not helpful. We had a suite across the street, well OMG, It was like something out of a horror show. We came from Canada and didn't know the city at all. We had picked up a hotel guide along the way and the Knights Inn was the featured hotel so we thought it had to be okay. Who ever put out that guide should be sued. Thank God we were able to find another hotel the next day. The room had bed bugs and when I told the person at the desk she accused me of bringing them with me.I tried to get a hold of Varsha Patel but she never called us back. I see she is quick to respond to bad reviews though. You are better off sleeping on the street instead of staying at this dump!!! Varsha wake up and smell the coffee! Go across the street and sleep in one of your rooms then you will know what everyone is talking about.
1	Amazing. This Hotel was amazing. My husband and I came here for one night to celebrate our 4 year wedding anniversary. The staff was very accommodating and let us check in early. Andrew the front desk guy was awesome and sent us a bottle of champagne after I told him why we were here. The room was nice and spacious and the shower is on another level. There are lots of restaurants near by and places to walk to. The light rail is right next to the hotel so it was super easy to get to the restaurants and bars further downtown. We would definitely stay here again. Thank you Andrew for making our stay amazing!Hello Amanda D, We thought you were pretty amazing too! I'll definitely share your accolades with the rest of the team. We hope you can try our restaurant, MATCH Restaurant and Lounge next time you stay. We hope to see you again soon.Thanks!
0	Welcome home/braves game. I flew in from a deployment to Afghanistan and met my family in Atlanta. We chose the hotel because of its proximity to the stadium. When we got our room we noticed a few problems: the futon bed/sofa had both back legs broken or detached. When my kids sat on it they nearly fell back into the wall. When I told the from desk they just put a roll away bed in the room (which you could feel every spring through). The shower faucet was falling off the wall as well. When I reported to the front desk they just didnt seem to care. When I called down for linen for the toll away bed they told me to come get it myself- because only one worker on duty. Just less than impressed with the stay. Unfortunate because the location is great. Thank you for staying at the Wingate by Wyndham Atlanta Galleria lisadJ4273! We appreciate you sharing your experience with us. Direct feedback from our customers, both good and bad is the most valuable advice we can receive. It helps us to recognize our areas of challenges and make the appropriate adjustments where necessary. Please accept our sincere apology for falling short of the standards we all expect from Wyndham hotels.
1	Virginia Beach, Newtown Road Hotel. I love that Denny's is right beside the hotel...that is one of the reasons why my family and I had came back to stay here again on our vacation. I did not like us getting non smoking rooms when I had reserved smoking in the first place. Unpacking in the wrong room then packing up again to move in the right room made me a little upset. Most nights that I had stayed there I couldnt sleep that well because of kids running up and down the hallways and knocking on our doors and running away. I believe the hotel staff should of been montioring the 3rd floors better than they had. The air conditioner did not work at all in room 343 and it got really hot in there.I believe the bathrooms could of been a little more cleaner than what they were. I had asked for a rollaway bed and didnt get one because they were all out. I asked for more pillows and blankets and all they gave me was two blankets. Yes it was pretty close to beach and zoo and all the must see sights. Next summer I plan on coming back to Virginia Beach but I will probably rent a beach house on Sandbridge for a week.
1	Great room for the money. The motel was 10 min fro the metro station. It was very convenient. A safeway was about 2 blocks away, (don't go to the Prospect Market--very expensive) The room was large enough for all six of us, the kitchen was adequate and saved us a lot of money. It was good we booked through hotels.com becasue we heard a few other customers fighting with the staff over their bill. When we checked out they said we were all paid and there was our reciept. The workout room was nice, the bathroom near the workout room hadn't been remodeled yet. There is internet but it didn't work very fast, they said they were updating it. No pay for view movies, but a nice big flat screened tv. Overall I would stay there again, loved the location and the fact it had a kitchen
0	Beware of hidden costs. They'll charge you a mandatory 20 fee/night for 2 bottles of water, gym access and wine at HH. This was complimentary a few months ago before the renovation. Speaking of which, the hotel lost its charm entirely. The rooms used to be colorful and unique...now they're brown and black just like any big chain hotels Hilton or Omni. Would NOT come back.Dear sfnicole22,Thank you for taking the time to share your honest review.We are deeply saddened to hear we failed to meet your expectations, particularly with regards to our new look.Is is most disappointing to learn your experience was marred by the Urban Amenity Fee. This fee is disclosed on our website at the time of booking and allows us to offer much more beyond the amenities provided before.We hope you will consider staying with us again during your future travels to San Francisco.Best wishes,Jeffrey RosenkrantzAssistant Front Office Managerjrosenkrantzjdvhotels.com
1	Excellent, Bali Vibe, Relax in Comfort and Style. OK. It is not Bali, but it comes close. Our room was ocean front, second floor with porch, but entry just up four stairs. Couches and easy chairs on an ample porch right on the ocean...this alone was body and soul cleansing. Inside, a nice living room, full working complete kitchen, dining table, an desperate bedroom with a comfy king bed and decent bathroom. But this does really not describe Pantai. Add in an Ari Ungung, which of course is a fire pit, huge, and the place for a bottle of wine at night. Or perhaps tables after dark with fire heaters Breakfast, well prepared, top quality, and varied every morning. But then there is the service. Everyone, I mean everyone was gracious, polite, sincere, wanting to please, friendly and accommodating. You are greeted by a wonderful, ok, very pretty, Russian woman from St. Petersburg, who just makes you feel like you have chosen the right place, down to the fellow who comes around 7 PM to turn down the bed and leave chocolates and a hand inscribed good night note. This is a most unusual place in that superb management shows through everywhere in the most gracious way. We will return!ZBGreetings zabriskibound,Thank you for taking the time to review Pantai Inn. I really enjoyed reading your description of what a unique place our oceanfront Inn is. There are very few (if any) places like us. We are pleased to see that all the hard work and effort is being noticed by our guests. Thank you for outlining the various amenities that we offer to our guests. Our complimentary deluxe continental breakfast is a marvelous way to start the day and our fire pit is a wonderful escape at the end of the day. Also, thank you for mentioning our service. All of the staff do a tremendous job in ensuring that our guests are satisfied. We are extremely fortunate to have a such a wonderful team. Hope to see you again soon. Thank you! Mike
1	Nice hotel in a good spot. The service was wonderful. Always cheerful and very helpful. This is quite important to me. The hotel is nice, but the tv had a very bad picture. It was an off brand. I'm not usually in the room much, so not hat big of a deal to me. If coffee is important in your room, you may want to bring your own or head out, as it's quite awful. Starbucks is almost across the street :) I also had a very difficult time with wifi reception in my room. I did accidentally lock my belongings in the safe without my code entered and they responded almost immediately to assist. Take note, the safe functions completely differently than any others I've ever used. Our friends did the same thing in their room. Valet is quite expensive, 40 per nt., but I'm sure parking is at a premium. We didn't need our car at all during our stay, as so much is within walking distance and there is a good bit of public transportation. Located right outside of the entrance to China Town.The bed was quite comfortable and we would choose this hotel again.
1	Convenient comfortable stop over.. Stayed at the Seven Seas for three nights en route to Los Angeles and San Francisco, yes it could do with updating but you get what you pay for. Hotels near to the city centre are much more expensive and it only cost 9 dollars in an uber to the harbour plus the bus terminus is only ten minutes walk with frequent travel to the centre. Our stay was comfortable and the staff helpful and polite, no problems with the room It was clean and roomy and you also have free on site parking which is a bonus. A couple of small swimming pools if you would like a relaxing dip and well kept gardens throughout the location. On site restaurant and bar which we didn't use as we were out early and back late. Easy to find just off the freeway would definitely stay again when visiting the area.
0	Limited free parking, atrocious view. The hotel was just ok. I picked this place for the advertised free parking. Unfortunately, the parking area was small and not near big enough to hold the guests cars. Adding to this issue, many of the employees were utilizing the free parking and there was not enough room for the guests. I had to park on the street 2... More
1	Easy Place to Get to Airport. Chose this hotel because it was close to the car rental and airport. After checking into the hotel, we returned our car early the night before our flight and Rose, the front desk lady suggested that we then take the shuttle from the car rental to the airport and they would pick us up with the hotel shuttle. What a fantastic idea. No bags to move out of the rental car.The room was comfortable and clean. I think the beds were the most comfortable on our trip. No refrigerator or microwave, but they do have a restaurant in the place that was most pleasant.We didn't use the pool, but it looked quite nice.The noise from the planes was not even heard due to the air conditioner in the room.Thank you very much for taking the time to share your comments about your stay with us. It is our hope that you can visit us again soon the next time you visit Phoenix.Kind Regards,Griselda MenaAssistant Manager
0	Don't stay there!!!!!. Service, food and staff are the worse! What more can I say!!!The front desk staff was completely worthless, had no knowledge of any questions I asked! No bar as advertised! Homeless people on the sidewalk of hotel. Felt like I was in the wrong neighborhood for sure. Don't stay there unless you want a dirty room and no service!
1	Trip to see the Atlanta Braves. Our experience was amazing. Geraldine at the front desk went above and beyond to get us into our room. We traveled in from Philadelphia early in the morning and while many guests were checking out she worked to get us into our room so we would be comfortable. She is an asset to your company.Geraldine is truly a gem. She is a great leader at the front desk and all the guests just love her. We are happy to hear that she made your stay just that much better. We hope you enjoyed the game and that you choose to stay with us again in the future.
0	Very disappointed. There was a restaurant charge on my invoice for 139.00 and I contacted the front desk to notify them that I did not eat at their restaurant, charge a meal to my room or order room service so obviously someone used by credit card info on file to charge a meal. The person working the front desk was dismissive and rude and just said We'll look it to it. I told him that was not good enough I wanted to know if my charge info and identity was compromised so I could notify my bank. I'll cut to chase he was no help. I asked to speak to a manage but I was told there was not manager on duty so two hours later I finally spoke to a manager Jim who told me the charges would be reversed in 3 days...I still don't know if my personal info has been compromised and I have to monitor my account everyday and the charges have still not been reversed. Terrible customer service. Bob
1	A gem in the San Francisco Jewel box!. Moved from literally a roach motel two doors down to find this gem! It was like finding gold! Beautifully chic room with a great location- what more can you ask for Clean You bet (and I'm a clean freak)! Easy to get anywhere from here (Union Square steps away) and staff was professional and responsive.The night we were there they were working on a production at the theater across the street- there was a lot of hub bub and noise but it didn't last and it wasn't awful. Can' say enough good things.Hi Mary Ellen,Thank you so much for taking the time to write such a nice review to share with other travelers! We are happy to know that you enjoyed your stay so much. Please let us know if we can be of any assistance in planning for your next trip to San Francisco. We look forward to seeing you soon!Best RegardsDana AndrewsGuest Relations
0	You get what you pay for. No better example that this place. Room OK, but with a damp, musky stench. Housekeeping lost TV remote and management tells me numerous times that it's in the room. My hearing isn't what it used to be, but my eyesight is 20/20. They are understaffed and a few of the desk crew would rather be somewhere else. WiFI is really weak as well. Life's too short to settle for something like this.
1	Perfect!!!. We recently visited the Shoreline Hotel in Waikiki and we would have to say that it was a great experience. My wife and I have both been to Hawaii several times before so we were not looking for a resort experience and were in town for a wedding. We needed a comfortable, quiet hotel that was conveniently located. This hotel was perfect for all of the requirements. It's located in the middle of Waikiki, easy to walk to all of the shops, great valet service, very friendly and helpful staff (ask for Kristy, she was the best!), and clean and comfortable rooms (By the way, the beds are very comfortable). The overall experience was perfect and extremely reasonably priced! My wife and I would definitely come back and stay again!Aloha jeckees!Thanks for the perfect review! Kristy at the Front Desk was especially flattered when she read your comments. Thanks for recognizing her! I agree that she truly is one of the best. You will have to escape your cold New York winter and come for some more perfect weather here in Waikiki! We would love to have you back again anytime!Mahalo!Brian AkerDirector of Rooms
1	Nice hotel, but be sure to check your bill. We recently stayed for one night at this hotel. We being me, my husband, and 3 of our children, ages 4, 3, and 9 months. The hotel was beautiful and the atmosphere elegant. I was not there at check-in, but it must have gone smoothly since my husband did it alone with all the kids while I was at a meeting and didn't complain!The kids enjoyed the indoor pool. However, the key did not work at first to get into the pool, requiring my husband to trek across the hotel and lobby with everyone in their swimsuits to get a new keycard.The room service was good, but I would have liked more choices, especially on the late night menu. And make sure to ask about a kids entree choices and prices, since they are not printed on the room service menu.Our room on the 14th floor was large and had 2 queen beds, a desk and chair, and a nice lounge chair. There was a good view, too!We got a good AAA rate of 99 a night.The only problem I had was with the billing, but it was fixed. We had to change our reservation to 1 night instead of 2. The bill I got had charged us as a no show for the first night, even though I had changed the reservation online in plenty of time. Also, there was a 9.95 internet fee that we didn't use. Both charges were taken off the bill, but it was still a hastle to have to address it at all.I would stay here again if I could get the same rate. However, I think hotels of this caliber should offer free internet, which draws me to other hotels.
1	Nice, close to Bourbon Street. Me and my husband stayed during Mardi Gras. Room was okay, some of details need to be cleaned though. Breakfast is expensive, I would recommend to go somewhere local place to have brrakfast since this hotel is located near French Quarter. Nice to have mini fridge in a room so we could store bottle of water and so on. Parking fee is almost 40 per a day, which is very expensive. We appreciate you taking the time to provide us with some great feedback. You're right, there are MANY, MANY great places around to grab breakfast and our front desk and concierge would be happy to assist you in finding somewhere that fits your liking. Thank you for staying with us, we certainly hope your Mardi Gras experience was a great one!See you again next year,Dixie Krauss, Operations Manager
0	Whats worse, rooms or management. When I got there we had to wait on our room because it was not cleaned. Not a huge deal we were early. When they got finished I noticed the rooms were very out of date and the furniture was in bad condition as well as stained. Still not a huge deal for 60 a night didn't expect 5 star.... More
0	Not what I expected from the Best Western Brand. We rarely were able to park near our room, and the one time we did another guest slammed their car door into our motorcycle. There was no real enforcement of any of the rules or common courtesies. The pool was only open until 1000 each night even though it is in a resort town were most activities run well into the evening. We were only able to use the pool once our entire stay. We used the laundry our last day there before our trip home and some of our clothes were stolen from the dryer. There was supposedly cameras there but we were told they could not access the video from them. Out of the entire 5 nights we were there the maid only serviced our room twice, but they were sure to leave a tip card in the room. If the service was exemplary we would have tipped them on our own. The balconies were covered with spiders. We told the front desk twice about it and their reply was to have the maid sweep it off. They then turned the lights off for the rest of our stay. Now we could not see the spiders on the chairs, the railings, and the doorways. Needless to say, no one used the balconies. Refridgerator in the room was not turned on, and when we did turn it on it was noisy and ineffective. The hotel itself looks like it needs updated badly. The beds were lumpy and the pillows uncomfortable. The walkway around the hotel along the water was dirty and in poor repair as well.
0	Do not stay here. We had to stay here during the Hurricane Irma and this place was the only place I could get a room for my family. The one good thing I can say is the staff is really nice. The room smelled old and the bathroom was gross. Well actually the whole hotel from the elevator up to our room smelled old. luckshot88, Thank you for your review of our hotel. We appreciate all feedback and are working to improve our aesthetic and functionality of our products continuously.
1	Modern, clean and luxurious. Walking distance to Union Square.. A great place to stay in downtown San Francisco. Across the street from Yerba Buena Gardens and walking distance to Union Square and lots of shopping.The rooms are spacious and luxurious, as you would expect. Service is friendly. The hotel restaurant, Vittrine, is also excellent.Enjoyed the free wi-fi too, which other travelers commented on being charged for... so perhaps this has improved/changed.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your review of your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco. I sincerely appreciate your kind words regarding our service, hotel dcor, and location and am pleased that you enjoyed your meals in Vitrine. As of February 2015, we do offer complimentary high speed internet access to all of our guests, so we are delighted to hear your comments. Please do not hesitate to contact me directly prior to your next stay, as we hope to welcome you back soon.Sincerely,Anthony DugganHotel Manager415-284-4057Anthony.dugganstregis.com
1	A Must See Hotel....an Attraction. What an experience....... Old on the outside.....New modern on the inside. Our room was Small but when in the keys you don't spend a lot of time in the room. First class service. Valet Parking which you need if u stay downtown. There is a 30 fee for parking but it's worth it. The reception room is very unique and the bar is beautiful. It does have a pool and gardens are beautiful. It's close to Malery park to watch sunsets and is by all the restaurants and bars.Thank you so much for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We always appreciate feedback whether it is good or bad and we are ecstatic that you had a great stay with us. Please come back and see us again, we would be delighted to have you!
0	dirty room and shower. the room was horrible with dirty showers. I would agree: that's the worst hotel I have ever been respectively that I left before I slept there as I just couldn't imagine, sleeping there during my holidays! I certainly will not recoomend this place to my friends!Dear Dimitri, we are sorry that you did not have a great stay with us. We aim to provide clean, comfortable and pleasant stay for all our guests so we are disappointed to hear that this was not the case. Our room service team generally does a great job when it comes to preparing the room for upcoming guests, so it is strange that this had happened. Please know we will look into your experience further to ensure this does not happen again. We hope you will give us another try.
0	Review of the customer service of a trip not yet taken. This is a review of the customer service that I experienced at the Hilton. You would certainly expect better customer service from a 4-star hotel. After booking, I immediately reviewed the information and noticed the date was incorrect. So I called them to make the necessary correction. Apparently, it routed to a different date because the preselected date was not available (that's what the agent told me). They would not give me a refund, allow me to change my date, or even a credit to be applied to future reservations (not even a partial credit!). Now I'm stuck with a reservation that I can't even use. Thus, this review will only be limited to the customer service as I won't be able to use the reservation to enjoy the room. After this experience, I'm boycotting the Hilton. It's unfortunate as I always choose the Hilton above other hotels. No longer a fan!We thank you for submitting a guest survey. It is very unfortunate that you booked a non-refundable/non-modifiable reservation online. This review, while being pointed at our hotel as the one providing poor service, highlights the drawback with booking these type of reservations online. Hilton urges guests to book reservations through our websites. While these other internet booking sites offer a significant discount, the reservations mostly are not guaranteed a specific room type (king or double) and, most importantly, the reservations are not modifiable and cannot be canceled. This is clearly stated through the website that you booked on. Please use Hilton.com to book your stay. With our reservations, we have the flexibility to assist you when reservations need to be modified.
1	Suprised. Did not know what to except at a hotel near airport.So glad we choose this one. Excellent stay. Friendly, helpful and professional staff.Room was clean and comfortable. Bathroom was immaculate.Taxi was available at 3:30 am for our trip to airport.Dining right next door.Did not use it , however the pool looked very nice.Thank you so much for telling us about your recent experience at our hotel. We are so glad that you had a pleasant stay. We strive everyday to exceed our guest expectations. We look forward to serving you and your family in the future!Thank you for making it the Hampton Inn By Hilton Philadelphia Airport!Adrian Woods, Director of Sales
0	1000 and a Soiled SOFA BED....Unprofessional and RUDE. The night front desk attendant Debbie was rude and unprofessional. She made sarcastic remarks such as I wish you could count in response to me asking for a certain number of towels. I awaited a call from the Front Desk Manager Gary Gillette all day on 2/29/16 he didn't call I had to call the hotel. He didn't care much... More
0	Horrible service smelly rooms. Not recommended. Pulled in here after a lovely drive up from LA. We were all in great spirits until we were checked in. Without going into too much detail the girl at reception was short, rude and unhelpful. After going into our smelly rooms I literally walked back out, cancelled our booking via a website booking dot com (burning 400 for that nights accommodation), loaded up the car and drove around at 6-7pm at night on a Friday - till I found another place for our 3 night visit, which was walking distance to Fishermans Wharf. The other place was actually pretty average but got a great deal and recouped the 400 on room rates, way closer to the Wharf/Lombard/Girardelli's area. Hi Tim, We are very disappointed that we were unable to meet your expectations, and that you were not greeted in the manner in which we aim to greet all of our guests. We apologize for the fact that our property was unsuitable for your needs. Best wishes, Hotel Management
1	What an awesome surprise!!. On a whim we decided to drive up to Napa from San Francisco for a few days. Unfortunately, most of the hotels Yountvilee, St. Helena, etc. were booked. So we decided to try the Ivy Hotel by Best Western. And what a great surprise! The rooms were huge and very comfortable (all recently remodeled), and the location was great. We were literally 10 minutes from Youtnville yet we only paid half the price of staying in Yountville. If you want to see Napa but not pay a fortune to do it - this place is for you. And there is a great restaurant two blocks away (Fume)....make sure you check that out too.
0	Smelly room with prank calls. When first walking in the room had a very strong smell of cleaners! We were told that all the rooms had just been cleaned and would smell the same. We got woke up at 1:40am by prank calls. Maybe they need a makeover!
1	Very Nice Stay! Very Comfortable Rooms, Good Service!. Paying 25.00 a day for parking seem ridiculous for parking spaces that could not fit a standard size car. Having to park to one side of the parking lane and still having to squeeze out of the car is not acceptable. This was the only disappointment in our stay. The rooms were clean and nice and comfortable with all amenities except for microwave. We wanted to reheat food that we had in the refrigerator but discovered no microwave in the room.Dear Guest, Thank you for writing a review of your stay in New Orleans. I am sorry that the parking fee was an unsatisfactory issue for you. We hope that you will give us another try. I am happy that the rest of your stay was enjoyable.Thank you, Bryant FaulGeneral Manager
0	Dingy, Poorly lit. We stayed in Dec. 2012 for 3 days. The price was higher when we checked in than what we reserved for. We were in the back and it poorly lit. Walls were extremely thin and we had to listen to a door slamming contest the first night. The breakfast was not deluxe by any means. Cheap small rolls, some fresh fruit (a couple of pieces at a time), so so coffee and orange juice. When they brought out container of rolls it was already picked through by staff. Tried to dipute the bill but only the manager could deal with it and the manager was never in every time I stopped at the office. Location was great but there are other hotels and we will stay elsewhere next time.
1	You SHOULD choose this hotel!. From the door service man to the front desk personnel to the maid service, ALL is excellent customer service at this Hotel Abri in San Francisco. All the employees are very kind and friendly, and are willing to do everything to make you happy. I spoke with the manager as well, and he was very kind and willing to talk to us to make sure we had an excellent stay. If I ever get back to San Francisco, I will stay at the Hotel Abri again. It's in a great location 1 block from Union Square.
1	Great, if you need to be in the area. The hotel is modern, in a retro way - clean with excellent fittings and friendly staff. Pictures on the web-site depict what you get very well and it is well-positioned for North Miami, if that is where you really want to be.Why didn't I rate it as excellent Basically, the neighborhood still has a ways to improve, so it is not a destination area in itself. The excellent restaurant on site is closed on Mondays (one of the two nights we were there) and the breakfast is basic. Nevertheless, we felt welcomed and enjoyed the large, comfy room.We are so happy to know that you enjoyed your stay/room and felt welcomed by the staff! We certainly look forward to your return visit to Miami.We are centrally located as the airport, downtown Miami, the beach and most major attractions in Miami are only 15 minutes away from the hotel. It is true that our complimentary breakfast is basic as it consists of coffee/tea/OJ, croissants, yogurt, english muffins, cream cheese and jam.
1	Great place. We enjoyed the hotel. Location was great walking distance to many sites. Paying to park was a surprise, but we decided that was better than staying further away and worrying about parking.Hotel was absolutely beautiful. Very nicely maintained. No old hotel odor. Staff was friendly and accommodating. The room was nice, very comfortable kept very clean by friendly housekeeping staff. Lovely city view. Traffic noise was noticeable. Bathroom was good sized, had a great shower, and was nicely kept. Restaurant was beautiful. Food adequate but not exceptional. Limited hours. Service friendly but I actually got up to get my own coffee refills one morning even though only two tables had customers. Overall a great experience and we would definitely stay again and recommend it to others.Thank you for your recent visit. We appreciate your feedback and look forward to hosting your next stay at the Whitney Hotel!Sincerely, Casey A. CallaisGeneral Manager
0	What value is a member profile. Not much is the answer that I have been repeatedly shown. I requested a feather free room for medical reasons. Checked in at the front desk and the room was being prepared. I asked in person to please have all feathers removed from the room. I have severe allergy to feathers. They said no problem and then put feather pillows on both beds. Inexcusable begavior and a lack of customer service.Thank you for sharing your concerns regarding your stay with us. I am sorry to hear that my associates were not attentive to your needs and overlooked your request. I can assure you that this will be addressed with the proper team members so that this is not repeated again. Thank you again for sharing your observations, and we hope to welcome you back again soon!Sincerely,Michael GoldwasserGeneral Manager
1	Very nice stay. Great value.. Came to town to bury my father in law in family plot. We had a total of seven people in three double rooms-we were all very comfortable. Breakfast was very good, hotel employees courteous and helpful. Only negative was the bathrooms were small. But, they were clean. Overall, value was great, room was clean, and we were in a safe part of town. We were on the highway side, which was a little noisy, but I had my earplugs. No one else was bothered by the noise. If you are a light sleeper, you may want to request a room not backed up to the highway. Hotel was great with accommodating all of our requests.
0	simply AWFUL.. the rooms were terrible, and the service was simply awful. never again returning and would advise anyone who was planning on choosing this place to not even waste their time because it would flat out ruin your trip.
1	A ness of elegance and beauty at Central Park. Welcome to one of the most iconic and beautiful hotels of Manhattan! Marble, crystals, golden leaf paintings, elegantly decorated rooms combining newest technology and extreme comfort in a charming style that one may find somehow a little bit Marie Antoinette. Kind staff, great Doorman from Bretagne, Champagne sabotage at the Bar. Maybe some room for improvement on the side of the kitchen to refine the bar menu and breakfast. A wonderful home feel. Congrats and Thank you! Dear jfcollobert,On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we would like to thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at our hotel. We are pleased to hear how much you enjoyed your stay and that our team provided you with excellent service. Thank you for recognizing us at Manhattan's most iconic hotel with a rich history, as well as the newest technologies. We look forward to having an opportunity to welcome you back to our hotel again soon.Kindly,Senih GerayGeneral Manager
0	Bad eggs / Not able to take a bath :(. Bad eggs for breakfast (they tasted more like mashed potatoes not eggs) / Not able to take a bath due to drain not working to hold up the water.. On either issue, staff did not really feel like it was of any concern.... :(Thank you for sharing this quick feedback on your recent stay with us via TripAdvisor. We appreciate your honest input on the comfort of our rooms and breakfast offerings and we will keep your comments in mind as we constantly look for new ways to improve our guests' experience. We hope you will return to stay with us the next time you are in town and let us know how we are doing. Thank you,Hampton Inn San/Diego/Del Mar Management Team
1	Couple weekend trip to Napa. The best western plus is located 10 minutes away from downtown Napa. It is located on Soscal Avenue that connects you to many of the top Yelp eateries. The hotel itself is what we have come to expect from the Best Western Brand. Clean and comfortable rooms, but nothing extravagant. There is a short swimming pool (8 yards) and a hot tub with jets. The property was quiet and had ample parking. There is a Denny's around the corner and that didnt bother me like other reviewers. The only trace is that you can smell sausage and pancakes from the parking lot. They do offer a free full breakfast with coffee. Overall I would recommend this hotel if you are afraid of the bed and breakfast scene like I am. Thank you for your review and recommendation. Our rewards members receive a free breakfast in the attached Denny's and most of our reviewers rate it above average as a Best Western Breakfast.. We are glad you enjoyed your free breakfast and stay with us and we hope to see you again in the near future.
0	Don't pay attention to reviews, they may be manufactured. Reviews had this place rated excellent, not in my opinion. The decor is out of date and the room wasn't clean other than the high points. Other than the walk way in the room the floor was dirty and had stains on the blanket as well. The breakfast didn't have butter for the waffles and not much to choose from.... More
0	Bad service. My car broke down two weeks ago on Route 18 and I had to pull over for the night because the weather was very bad. I asked for a smoking room. The room I was put in didn't have any ash trays and I had to walk down to the office to get the ashtrays myself, as the staff wouldn't... More
0	Family Time in Seattle. We were in town to visit with our daughter and also see my brother. We stayed at the Hyatt House. The staff was friendly but not very empowered. Their directions on the ways you have to use the room key in the elevator and room were not very clear. We heard that over and over again as we went up and down the elevator with other visitors. The room had strange windows that looked out to the hotel interior. We missed having a window to do a quick weather check. The bathroom was spacious but had the most non-ergonomic faucet. Turning it on meant bumping your hand on the lighted mirror above the sink and that was unpleasant. All the elevators stopped working at one point and the staff only offered a free bottle of water despite the significant challenge for the hotel visitors. I observed a person in a wheel chair as one example. No help was offered for getting yourself or luggage to and from the lobby (besides a free bottle of water from the lobby shop). Although sometimes things happen, it is how the staff responds and this was a major disappointment. The free shuttle will take you up to 1 mile away if it is available or you can wait. The breakfast buffet was good, but they did not always restock items (including coffee lids) in a timely fashion. I don't recommend this hotel.
0	STAY AWAY. This was the absolute worse stay at a motel I have ever experienced. We told the owners that we were looking to stay between one and two months. We were shown an efficiency down back....kitchen, living room and bathroom. Everything was agreeable until the owner realized I needed a nurse to come in twice a week for one hour. The... More
1	Great location, beautiful hotel, excellent service!. I recently had the opportunity to stay at the Hyatt Centric and it was a blast! Apart from the comfy room, and the really helpful staff, the hotel was in a great location, not too far away from the beach, and just a block and a half away from the shops on Kalakaua Ave!Hi tansvanessa,Thank you for sharing your review of your experience with us at Hyatt Centric Waikiki Beach. We see you enjoyed an outstanding experience and were able to spread out in our comfy guest rooms. We appreciate your recommendations to our upcoming guests and look forward to welcoming you back in the near future.
0	unsafe. Location is unsafe and hotel looks pretty old. I used to stay at Best Western but I do not recommend anyone to stay here.
1	Better than I expected. I stayed at this motel from 7/11 - 7/16 2012 for Comic-Con. I was wary of it based on some negative reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. Check in was easy, and they let us add a day to the end of our stay at a discounted rate. The room was clean and included a mini fridge and coffee maker. We had the queen suite, which includes a bedroom and a separate living area with a pull out sofa. It included two full bathrooms, both with showers. I showered at different times each morning and always had plenty of hot water. I was apprehensive about using the pullout sofa so I brought a blowup twin mattress, and there was plenty of space for it. The only kind of gross thing was that there were a couple of hairs in the obviously otherwise clean pillowcases - I attributed these to belonging to the housekeeping staff. We asked for more linens and got them within 20 minutes.The room entrances are all outside off the parking lot, but I never felt unsafe as others have mentioned. The door had two secure locks which I used, but I never saw anyone hanging around during my stay that made me feel nervous about security. I did not hear excessive noise, but then again I sleep with ear plugs, so who knows. Nothing noticeable while I was awake. The washers and dryers were nice to have - you will need quarters and there is no change machine. The pool looked nice although I did not use it. The on-site diner-type restaurant was a little pricey, but the food was good. Room service is available until 10PM.All in all it was a pleasant stay. I would not stay there again for Comic-Con, as I realized it would be more convenient to stay downtown, but in general it's a fine motel in a good location.
0	TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. I have stayed at this hotel several times and every time something little was wrong but we overlooked it. As I was checking in the front desk/manager told me that my room was a problem room 312 because people smoke in it. She said there was a smoke smell and smoke burns. That was the least of the problems when... More
1	Beautiful Hotel in the Best Location. The number one advantage of this hotel is the location. The fact that you can take MARTA from the airport, walk out of the Lenox station and be at the hotel is amazing. I used the convenient car service to get around the Buckhead area to where I was working. My favorite restaurant, Houston's, is conveniently across the street. It's also connected to Lenox Square, so it's perfect for finding the perfect gift for family at home. The staff was very friendly. When I arrived, they acknowledged by Gold status and upgraded me to a larger room on the Concierge level. The breakfast in the Concierge lounge was excellent, as was the service by the staff. The room was tastefully decorated, but a little bit too traditional for my taste. The bathroom was nice, but needs an upgrade. The bed was awesome, clean, and very comfortable.If I can get the same rate at this hotel again, I will definitely stay here again.
0	Horrible customer service and poorly maintained. As a Marriott Gold member, I've seen my fair share of Marriott properties. This was by far the WORST Marriott I have ever stayed at, and it was more like a motel than a Marriott hotel property. For starters, the room smelled musty/moldy and mine was not prepared properly, as I was given less than a fourth of a roll... More
1	luxurious, friendly, comfortable. We were at the Club Pulse for just one night. Everything was perfect, staff at the front desk were very friendly and knowledgeable, everyone we ran into was professional and nice, the room was super comfy. We had a suite with a kitchenette (microwave, refrig with freezer unit, coffee maker, dishes, flatware, glasses for water and wine), 2 televisions - one in the bedroom the other in the living room. The seating was very comfortable and a table to eat. I highly recommend this property. We were in town to see the play Hamilton, we were easily able to walk to the Gas Lamp for dinner and then to the Civic Theater.Thank you for a perfect review! We are pleased to hear you enjoyed your stay and look forward to welcoming you back again sometime.
1	Recommended. I went with my family. The hotel is very new and service is good. On the downside it's far from Napa downtown and farther from the wine yards. Breakfast can get very crowded. There is a cinema and some restaurant at walking distance if you don't want to drive. Good place if you don't want to drive further to get to the attractions. Dear Alejandro M,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We thank you for your feedback and comments. We are located near several restaurants and the Cinema which is very convenient for travelers to the area. There are over 500 wineries in Napa and depending on which wineries you are looking to travel to our hotel does have easy access to the local highway to get you to your winery destination. We thank you again for your valuable feedback and hope to serve you on your next trip to Napa, Serina Najar.
1	Hotel Diva in San Francisco. Amazing stay at an amazing hotel in a fantastic city.It was a fabulous experience in a great location. Staff couldn't have been more professional and kind. I had an extended stay and coffees at the Starbucks in the neighboring building, and close distance to Union Square made my stay all the better.Highly recommend the stay. Oh and met some great international travelers while at the hotel.Book the Diva - you will want to come back for more!Hello Ivana K,Thank you for giving Hotel Diva a five star review on Trip Advisor. We all appreciate your kind comments. I'm glad to hear you had the chance to meet some of our other guests. I hope you had a memorable stay and that you would think of us again on your next visit to San Francisco.We look forward to seeing you soon!Best regards,Virgil LopezHotel Manager
1	Stay there almost every Disney trip. I stay here due to the proximity to Disneyland, it's a quick walk to the parks, and because I get the Best Western rewards. If you book enough in advance the prices are in line with the cheaper cost hotels. All BW hotels have decent beds, bathrooms, come with microwave and fridge with a good TV and channels. The housekeeping staff does a good job with the cleaning. They do not offer breakfast, but they do give Denny's breakfast vouchers and they offer a go bag in the morning with an apple, a granola bar, and a small water. I'm usually in too much of a hurry to get to Disneyland to where breakfast doesn't matter anyways. The Stovall's BW is a few hotels closer, but is usually a little more and they charge for parking, but they have a full breakfast. Both are good to stay in. The BW on Ball Rd is nice too, but the walk is further.
0	Disappointment. When we booked there was nothing to say about a dance club open only Friday and Saturday nights right below our room2nd floor. Also this club is not owned by the hotel and you have to pay to get into it also open to 330am and LOUD.. There is nothing in the area for miles in which to have a top notch meal only fast food frightening at best to order. Shopping is very little. Not a very safe neighborhood. Driving there not very easy to find. If you are going to an NFL football game driving to game is actually very easy only about 5 minutes but to take any other means of transportation is way out of the way and expensive.
1	My choice from now on when I visit DC. I booked 2 rooms online and made special requests directly to the hotel, all of which were met without any problems. I had some additional requests on our arrival again all were met with great attitudes by the hotel employees. The staff was always pleasant and helpful. Though it is close to the highway, our rooms were in the front and below highway level, so noise was not at all a problem. The free breakfast is great, offering freshly baked waffles, scrambled eggs, and fresh fruit, as well as the usual. Shuttle was always available during our stay and took us to restaurants as well as the Metro. We will definitely return when we visit the DC area again.
0	Pimps and hookers, holla!. If cheap sex, great drugs, and a constant party outside your door, with tweakers looming everywhere, ready and willing to find you a fix of any drug imaginable is what you crave, then Best Inn and Suites is exactly what the doctor ordered!

1	Great Stay near Virginia Mason Hotel. A perfect place to stay near major hospitals with discount rooms for patients. The large suite was very comfortable and well appointed but the air conditioner was very noisy and the pipes were leaking from the unit. All of the staff were very friendly and most helpful with special needs for the patient.Thank you for your feedback - we're glad you found our hotel convenient for your stay. Thank you also for your feedback on your air conditioner and the pipes. We are in the process of upgrading many things at the hotel including the pipes attached to the air conditioning. We hope you'll return for a visit in the future!
1	Suntrust Park vistor. The location can be a little aggravating getting into from the direction I come from my only real complaint what's the hotel was extremely hot in the lobby and then the hallways the staff was very friendly though the best part about this stay was I was able to walk two SunTrust Park overall a nice hotelDear V4564NVpatrickl, WOW! Thank you for all of your compliments. I have shared your review with my staff just to show them how important everyone on the team is to creating a great guest experience. We are definitely looking forward to your next visit to Atlanta!Tremeil BooneAssistant Manager
0	Snel doorrijden, geloof de postivo's niet!. Wat een desolate toestand. Achterstallig onderhoud in het kwadraat in een desolate omgeving. Vieze lucht als je binnenkomt. Tijdens verblijf nog brand op een andere verdieping, geen noodplan geen enkele coordinatie. Risicovol om daar te slapen!! Het eten was zeer slecht!
0	Not if my life depends on it. This hotel is very poorly managed. There was never more than one young (friendly but inexperienced) employee at the front desk. I had eight rooms reserved for a group and ultimately all but two of our group moved to another hotel for a variety of reasons... couldn't get hotel door open (dead bolted from inside!), filthy corridors, smell of trash,...

When i got there that was true. i pull a 40 foot 5th wheel camper, It was ok for parking but to turn around to leave was very tight. I would not suggest this hotel for camper parking. The room...

1	Fantastic service, Staff and rooms ultra clean. Stopped overnight here for our visit to Orlando and not disappointed at all. I am convinced the staff could have there worst day ever and still be smiling their aptitude is so positive you can feel the energy.Even the guy that mops the floor greets you with a smile and a good morning. the rooms are ultra clean as well as all the hotel. the hotel also boasts a bar grill and the service and food are fantastic. I have stayed at a lot of hotels and this one by far is 5 star.It was our pleasure to host you at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport, and thank you for sharing your feedback. I am so pleased that you felt we were successful in meeting your needs and expectations in regard to your spotless room and our excellent service. We look forward to the opportunity of welcoming you back soon!Sincerely,Michael GoldwasserGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport
1	AMAZING STAFF. I stopped in on business, my flight was delayed by several hours and decided to call it a night. From the moment I made a call and asked if they had any rooms available I was treated warmly and with kindness. The rooms were clean, it was surprisingly quiet. The beds were comfortable and I was able to get a good nights sleep and a hearty breakfast before my flight back. I dealt with William and Joel upon my exit and both cared enough to make sure I was rested and well treated! I travel a lot with my company and will DEFINITELY make sure I am booked here every trip to Orlando! GREAT JOB STAFF!
1	Always Enjoy Staying Here. When we fly into Orlando to visit family on the east coast we usually get in late and stay near the airport before driving over the next morning. My go to hotel is the Hilton Garden Inn MCO. The staff is very friendly, the service is always consistently good and the accommodations are clean and comfortable. Our most recent stays were during and then shortly after renovations and the new lobby looks modern and inviting. The restaurant offers a very good breakfast and my only disappointment from our last stay was having to leave before the restaurant opened in order to catch an early flight.Dear Guest Charlie W, I would like to thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to write about your experience during your stay at the Hilton Garden inn Orlando Airport. We know that when traveling our guests have many options to choose from and we value and deeply appreciate your loyalty and support. Your comments have been communicated to all our associates and posted in our bulletin board as a reminder of how much we can impact our guests in a positive way and a job well done.We are looking forward to welcome you, friends and family members to once again provide you with an outstanding level of service and nothing less. Sincerely,Alex BlancoGeneral Manager
0	Hot smell. I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. The room was small and had a smell that cannot be described. The breakfast that is included is not the greatest.
1	Cool Vibe Central Location. If you are looking for a hotel with a cool Miami-style vibe in a central location, this might be the place for you. The hotel is located right on the main drag (Duval street) so it's close to restaurants, drugstores, bars, etc. You can walk to everything from the hotel. The downside to the location is that it is close to Duval. We were in a room that was close enough to Duval that you could hear partying way into the night. After having difficulty sleeping the first night (noise until about 3 am) we asked to moved the next morning, the person at the front desk entertained the idea but was not able to come through. An apology or at least some empathy would have been nice (for example, Oh, I'm sorry the noise kept you up). That was not the case. The response was, At least you're not in rooms xxx and xxx because those are right on Duval. Not what I expected from a place like this and also because we are platinum members of the hotel chain. The pool area is small but lovely with its zen motif and trees in the background. The rooms were also pretty hip and the toiletries very nice. The hotel staff was fine...cordial..but not friendly or terribly accommodating. The free breakfast perk for platinum members was a parfait (fine but not up to par with other hotels in the brand). I might have taken the points and paid for the breakfast instead. At the least they should give you a credit to apply to something else. The bikes on the property were GREAT! We also enjoyed outstanding drinks at the stylish hotel bar. Overall, we had an enjoyable stay and would probably choose the hotel again the next time we are in the keys. Thank you for taking the time to write a detailed review of your stay with us. We are glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay aside from some of the issues that you mentioned. We are disappointed to hear about some of the issues you had and we will be sure to address them. We do hope you will return and allow us the opportunity to provide you with a perfect stay.
1	Impeccable Service. It was a great experience staying at the JW Marriott Buckhead for our first time. Although we stayed for one night to do some shopping but I must say it was still an enjoyable time. I wished we were able to stay a few more days. The staff of JWMB will see to it that youre completely cared for and then some. Every single employee, from valet to those in passing heading to/from the elevator, was extremely professional and personable. Overall the hotel is extremely lovely with wonderful services and amenities (we love that checkout is at noon)! The employees exemplify outstanding teamwork and are tremendously professional. I highly recommend you book with JW Marriott Buckhead whether for personal, business or a future group event. Youll be taken care of and enjoy your time there!Dear CND09,Thank you for posting such kind comments about our hotel, especially about our staff. We make every effort to provide service that is above and beyond your expectations, so we are pleased to see that you loved your stay. We look forward to sharing your comments with our team. Thanks again for choosing the JW Marriott Atlanta Buckhead, and we hope to welcome you again soon.Eb MbyeDirector of Operations
1	Excellent Experience Thanks to Ron!. Our company had a two day meeting at the hotel and besides the fact that the hotel itself is excellent with updated rooms and a great location the staff is what made the experience exceptional. We had the chance to spend some off-time at the lobby bar (...in the lobby) and the servers were impeccable. I can't say enough on how accommodating they were for our large group but in the end what made this a memorable event was Ron Romero from Banquets. Ron took care of us all day long each day and was so attentive you never felt like you were missing anything and if by chance you did Ron was right there to take care of it. You could tell Ron loves what he does and his attention to detail should be commended. Thanks Ron!!!Jason L - Thank you for sharing your experience with Trip Advisor from your recent stay and meeting held at the Westin San Diego. I am pleased to read your overall experience exceeded your expectations from the staff, to the venue and the new modern design, as a result of our recent 15 million transformation. We are so proud of our new property and it shows through the staff's enthusiasm and desire to provide the 5 star service your received by so many, including Ron. Thank you for personally recognizing Ron for his efforts and I will be sure to share your feedback with Ron and his team. This is how it should feel! Be Well, Alyssa TurowskiGeneral Manager
0	Overprice. I think the price for the rooms was overpriced. The room was not very clean for the and the exhaust fan in the bathroom was very loud. There is a refrigerator and microwave in the room. The refrigerator did keep the stuff cold.
1	Enjoyed my stay. I really enjoyed my stay at the Windsor Inn. I stayed there for 7 nights at the beginning of October. The front desk staff was amazing and were quick to offer suggestions. The housekeeping staff was great as well, my room was always clean. The hotel itself is newly renovated.The hotel is a quick walk from Seaworld and provides a free shuttle to Disney. The free breakfast was pretty standard but had some of the best hotel coffe Ive experienced. On the nights that I didnt eat supper at the parks, I ate at a nearby restaurant called Village Inn. I usually just ate breakfast for supper but it was good and reasonably priced.Im looking forward to returning for my next trip!Thank you for your kind comments. We are always pleased to hear that guests enjoyed their stay with us. We are now called the Best Western Plus Orlando Convention Center Hotel. We have upgraded a few more things since your stay. We now feature a full hot breakfast with eggs, sausage and fresh waffles along with the offerings you enjoyed. We will continue to improve the guest experience and hope you will come stay with us the next time you are in Orlando.
1	Superseded My Stay Expectations.. Overall the staff, hotel cleanliness and the amenities like breakfast was up to my satisfaction. Even though the Hotel had signs apologizing for renovations I am so happy that we didn't hear or had any complaints concerning the renovations. We didn't even notice the people or rooms being renovated. My stay was enjoyable with piece and quiet all around just like I love my stays. The only complaint which wasn't a big issue for me was the slow internet service provided. Although it was complimentary free wifi, I think I would of paid a few dollars for quicker faster internet wifi services on my stay. No biggie if you don't need it. The bed was more comfortable than I had expected I give you guys 5stars on comfort and cleanliness! I will be coming back here on my next stay!
1	If you get the chance, stay here. I have never been a bite snob but I must say that St. Regis is starting to spoil me. The NY hire is superb and really adds to the stay. Other hotels in NY are so small and the St. Regis revamped its hotel and made all the rooms larger-and nicer. And it shows. Fruit is delivered each night. And not only do you get one piece of chocolate but an entire tray each night. It really got ridiculous because I just ate it all and it was really too much (work on the self control). Luckily they had a great work out room open 24 hours and I used it every evening. I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. It is a rare opportunity for me to stay there and I took full advantage. The bottom line is if you get the chance, stay here. Anyone who says this hire is terrible should be banned from staying anywhere but their own home. The service is exceptional. I left a shirt at the hotel and they tracked it down for me and delivered it with personalized service. They literally made me feel that finding my shirt was the most important mission for the entire hotel staff. It is just a level of service rarely seen any more and entirely refreshing (as long as you don't mind the price).Dear JD, It was truly a pleasure having you as our guest during your recent business trip to New York City and glad we were able to assist with tracking down your missing garment.On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we are so pleased that you were able to experience our hotel and enjoy the high service and quality levels upon which we pride ourselves. Thank you for taking the time to review our property on TripAdvisor, and we look forward to seeing you again soon.Warmly,Hermann ElgerGeneral Manager
1	Boston Marathon runner's ideal location!. Bad: Breakfast a bit simple, but plenty of places to eat in the local area. Also, the safe in our room didn't seem to work, but it wasn't a big deal. Good: Excellent location, with Copley T (metro) station within a few minutes walk, and a range of restaurants and bars along Boylston Street. The Back Bay area also has a few great sights to see, like the old Trinity Church and Boston public library, which are almost within spitting distance of the hotel. If you're here during the Boston Marathon (mid April), the hotel is almost literally on the finishing line, which could be very useful or very inconvenient, depending on whether you're a runner or not!
0	cold shower, loud at night. Was not able to run hot water from shower - was told by staff just to let water run for 20+ minutes and then it would be hot. Quite noisy at night with cars honking, sirens, etc. Didn't get much sleep. Was just traveling for a work conference, so not needing anything fancy in terms of accomodations, but basics like warm water and a good night's sleep were missing!Dear Jessica W,I appreciate the review of your recent stay at our hotel. Im very sorry that we fell short of your expectations. I hope you give us another chance to serve you if your travels bring you back to our area. Please know that we value your business and will work hard to earn your trust once again. Again, I do apologize for the inconvenience. If you would like to discuss further, please feel free to call me at 404-589-1111Hospitably Yours,Andrew May General Manager
1	Wonderful Surprise. Our stay at the Ocean Tower Hotel was amazing! I read one review that didn't understand why this hotel had such good ratings. Well, he must be used to spending 200+ per night for a hotel room, or never traveled to Hawaii. Hotels with this location are often 300+ per night. The reviewer mentioned it being in need of a remodel. Well, unfortunately for those of us used to watching how we spend our money, they are remodeling the hotel and the rooms look awesome!!! They look nicer than the Arizona Biltmore and Phoenician Resort in Scottsdale, Arizona if you have been there. (I had only worked there and got the view the rooms, as I could not afford to spend 400+ per night.) So, when the rates are higher, and in line with the majority of the other hotels, that reviewer should be happy because the new rooms are truly gorgeous. People pay for gorgeous. They are the most modern beautiful hotel rooms I have ever seen.We actually felt lucky to get to stay there before the major remodel. The location is so close to the beach and downtown activities. We could walk to all kinds of wonderful things to do and see. Diamond Head was our view out our bathroom window. I would recommend spending the extra 15 or so per night for the ocean view. So, it wasn't fancy, but it was fun and helped us be able to save quite a bit of money. The bed was comfortable, the ocean breeze was to die for, and we couldn't have asked for more in that price range. I also have to recommend a corner room if you get lucky to have a cross-breeze of ocean air.However, what made it the most wonderful stay was the staff. We were treated like family from the moment we arrived. We never felt so cared for in a hotel. The friendly, caring and attentive staff made it a 5 star hotel in our eyes. We cannot wait to go back and see all the friends we made there. If on a budget get in on the older rooms before they are remodeled. If you have the extra money, get an amazing remodeled room, you won't be dissappointed.
1	Tabatha J Hot Chocolate Run 15k. I was at this hotel for the Hot Chocolate Run 15k We were very close to Turner Field where the race was held The staff was excellent They told us how to catch the bus train Gave us recommendation on were to eat which was walking distance from the hotel (convient) I will definetly stay at this hotel again when I visit Atlanta The hotel is old but I did have a great time Special shout out to Tonya, Marchelle, the mgr of housekeeping Thanks alot ladiesThank you for taking the time to complete our online survey regarding your recent stay at our hotel.Your feedback is very important to us and we can assure you that we will use this information to do everything possible to create an enjoyable experience for each of our guests. We hope to see you again soon!Sincerely,Joya GregoryGeneral ManagerComfort Inn Turner Field Atlanta, GA404-658-1610
1	Good airport stay!. This property has recently undergone renovations and it shows - the lobby area was amazing. Check-in was prompt and courteous and despite what other reviews may indicate the shuttle to and from the airport was hassle free and not overly time consuming, 15 mins at most. We dined at the restaurant and the food and service was exceptional and not overly priced for an airport hotel. The room was comfortable and quiet and the in-room coffee is always appreciated. The fitness facilites were clean and provided anything you may have forgotten offered more than a few treadmills and ellipticals like most hotels - provided both free weights and machines. Staff was friendly and accomodating. Overall would recommend this hotel and will add it to our list should we ever be in need near O'Hare again.Dear thejohnsons556,Thank you so much for your kind words. We appreciate you taking the time to write a post about our hotel. We are delighted you enjoyed your past stay and we look forward to the opportunity to have you back again soon. Happy New Year and safe travels.
0	Rudest staff ever!!!!. I booked at hotels.com for a quick overnight trip for our nephew's graduation. The inn touted itself as a European boutique hotel, but it's really a step up from a hostel. Bare bones. We paid half the fee charged on their website for a double room. Double means just that: double beds. When I called to confirm the day before our trip, I got no answer, so I emailed. The reply from the front desk staff was condescending and rude, and immediately I regretted booking at the Highland Inn. I then discovered that others have complained (if you want link, let me know). It was too late to cancel, so I arrived with trepidation. The room was spartan, the shower was awful, the a/c window units were not very effective, the carpet was old, the fridge was banged up, and the breakfast was paltry. However, the neighborhood was cute (my local relative said it was not that good but I couldn't tell from our brief stay) and it's close to historic midtown (2 miles). The management never contacted me re the rude reception, and my final recommendation is to go somewhere else.Thank you for taking the time to leave us a review. We take all feedback seriously, and sincerely regret that you did not have a positive experience with us. Currently, we are replacing the window units throughout the hotel with individual heating/cooling units, however, if your unit was not working efficiently we would have been happy to move you and the same goes for the shower. Any time you are not happy with anything during your stay, we are more than happy to help. Upon further investigation, I am having trouble locating the email you spoke of, and it certainly is not in keeping with how we treat our guests. We urge you to contact us directly to discuss. We strive to make our guests stay the best it can be and would be more than happy to address this situation with our staff. Thank you,Kristin Anderson
0	Keep away from this hotel is the worst and dirtiest of orlando.. In my life I had stayed at a hotel so dirty, I thought it would be of good quality and cheap service because it was easy compared to others that cost 49.50, this cost 69.50. Trip with my dog and was charged a fee of 10.00 which is very expensive because I sent a special area for dogs that was dirty, the habitaccion smelled musty and the carpets and walls were filthy, the bathroom was very dirty too, and had ticks, not to mention the color that had curtains instead of white had gone grayI think do not clean those rooms long ago. breakfast they offer is terrible and of poor quality. I was in this hotel the day Tuesday 05 June to 06 2012.
0	Not as good as the usual Hilton Garden Inn. I stay in HGI all the time and usually it is reliably clean with very pleasant staff. Our room was fairly worn and not someplace you would want to walk barefoot. More than that, the staff weren't super helpful - stingy on the tiny shampoo bottles when I asked for more (I was traveling with 3 daughters with a lot of hair), refused to let us have breakfast even though we arrived before 10am (granted it was 9:55am but the full buffet was still sitting there). To top it off, the pool is only open at night on weekdays even though it was a holiday weekend Monday.
0	Charged cancellation fee... Didn't stay here because my meeting was postponed a week but they charged me for 1 night's stay anyway--440--because I cancelled 20 hours ahead rather than 24 which is their policy. Did they rent the room anyway Would a reputable hotel do this Shouldn't the 1 night's stay cancellation fee have been waived They refused to be reasonable. Avoid this place.Dear 699 Traveler, After reading your comment on Trip Advisor I did want to take time to reply to your questions and concerns. Most reputable hotels have a cancellation policy that they adhere to in which case you are correct in stating that our cancellation policy is 24 hours prior to arrival. Orchard Garden Hotel is pleased to offer this cancellation policy as other hotels have a 72 hour cancellation policy. Please feel free to contact me at your convenience to discuss using your cancellation fee toward a future deposit during your next visit at our beautiful hotel. You may contact me directly at 415-399-9807. Thank you for your comment and I look forward to hearing from you soon,Bruce Pinckney Front Office ManagerOrchard Garden Hotel
0	Okay. It's pretty old and in a pretty bad area. It's convenient to UT Southwestern Medical Center. The free breakfast was nice and staff was great. The rooms were adequate. It seemed very tired though. You can tell they do their very best to keep up an older property but if you're picky, this probably isn't the place for you. Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. We appreciate the comments regarding our team. Our hotel has undergone a renovation 2 years ago and we continually strive to make improvements all of the time. I hope you will choose our hotel again on your next trip to Dallas.
1	Awesome stay. I have to say that I was very pleased with my stay at this hotel. The customer service was excellent, the staff friendly and attended to my needs with a prompt response. Breakfast was also very good, rooms clean and overall appearance of the facility was impressive to say the least. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone going to San Diego. Thank you for the recommendation! We recently opened the hotel in July with the latest Hampton Inn design. We're pleased that our Team was able to accommodate your needs during your stay. We hope that we'll be your first choice should you return to the San Diego/Hotel Circle area.
1	EVERYTHING!. Bad: There was nothing I didn't like! It was the best!. Good: EVERYTHING! The staff was amazing and friendly, very courteous, always made sure you were ok and comfortable. They gave suggestions on things to do and places to go...simply amazing! The hotel smelled amazing, it's the first thing you notice walking in! It's very clean and nice. You get beach towels, a chair and umbrella. The beach is literally a block away, and you're also located a block from all of the action of South Beach. The hotel is located in a quieter area, so it's great to wind down after a long day. This hotel was one of the highlights of our trip! We will always stay here for our trips to Miami, I'm so happy we chose this hotel!
1	A little bit pricey!. It is very close to the medical center and the UIC medical center. I walked from the hotel to the Greek neighborhood and it was just 25 minute walk. It is located close to the metro station.Rooms are spacious, clean, and the mattress was excellent. My only concern is the price, a little bit pricey.Marisa,Thank you for taking the time to give us feedback about your recent stay. We are delighted to know that the location was good for you and your guest room was clean and comfortable. I have shared your comments in regards to the price with the appropriate hotel staff. It was a pleasure having you as our guest. We look forward to accommodating you again, should your future travels bring you back this way.Have a great week!Stephanye
0	"""Quality"" Inn. Awkward and inefficient front desk staff. Worst check in I've experienced. Hotel is dirty and room smelt like a wet dog. Fire alarm cords hanging from ceiling (with no alarm) and plastic cup secured over fire sprinkler."
0	Terrible check-in service, 2 hours late with our room, never again. Our family of five (myself, my wife, and our three daughters) had booked a room as part of a block of guests for my wife's cousin's wedding on Saturday, onsite at the St. Regis hotel scheduled for 6:00 pm. I confirmed that we'd receive a double bed room in a few days ahead of our arrival, which was the same afternoon of the wedding.I called at 2:00pm that afternoon, an hour before the official check-in time of 3:00pm and the front desk told me they were finishing up our room, took down my cell phone number, and would call me when it was ready.We arrived around 2:30pm, stepped up to the counter to check-in at 2:50pm and our room was still not ready. OK, we thought perhaps a few more minutes ... which ticked away, and away, and away! My wife went back and asked for our room because we had to get prepared for the wedding! While the desk personnel were apologetic, they tried to offer a handicap accessible room, which we did not want. Then they tried to blame the situation on the fact that we had booked a king room on the reservation block for which they had already written and confirmed we reserved. The clock is ticking past 4:30pm ... and finally we get our room keys!We hurry outside to where our bags have been sitting on a luggage cart, tell the attendant that we have our room and need our bags immediately to prepare for the wedding, now about 1 hour away! We thought our bags would arrive on the heels of our entering the room, but NO ... again waiting ... so we started to prep the younger girls ... still no bags!My sixteen year old daughter went back down stairs and found our bags had not moved! She was livid ... and finally got them to start moving the cart. It was 5:15pm by the time our bags came. I understand that porter was just doing his job, when he asked if he could set up our bags in any particular place or if we needed ice, or how to operate the room controls ... but at that moment our immediate needs were for him to get the bags in the room as fast as possible and to leave so we can dress for the wedding! We all rapidly threw ourselves together ... my wife having triple duty ... in order to arrive a few floors down for the wedding.The entire experience of checking in was horrendous. From the call to confirm at 2:00 pm until we got our room and finally our bags! Not one of the hotel staff exhibited any sense of urgency for our situation. To appease us, they offered and we accepted to park our car onsite for a free night.On an afternoon full of anticipation for seeing family and friends at the wedding and reception (also at the St. Regis) ... we went through a tremendous amount of stress from that check-in experience. We're seasoned travelers so we can and have handled the ups and downs of travel ... in this case, I had to double my normal 24 hour rule for posting a negative review, because I'm still fuming. A five star hotel such as the St. Regis should never have their guests wait 2 hours past their own published check-in time to access their room.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for sharing your thoughts on your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco. I sincerely apologize on behalf of our entire staff for the extended delay upon arrival to your room and the multiple inconveniences that were caused to you and your family. I encourage you to contact me directly so that we may further discuss the details of your stay, and how we may improve this unfortunate experience. Sincerely,Anthony DugganHotel Manager415-284-4057Anthony.dugganstregis.com
1	Love the Maritime Hotel!. Our stay was perfect - from the moment we checked in. The staff were friendly and helpful. We enjoyed the happy hour - great selection of wine and snacks. The room was nice - NYC small but had everything we needed. The bathroom had everything - including bubble bath and toothpaste! Who does that We liked the neighborhood - haven't stayed in Chelsea before, but it was a great location. We cabbed it to Broadway for dinner and a show, but also did lots of walking - including up to the Natural History Museum. It was a short stay, but we can't wait to go back to the Maritime Hotel!
1	Very Reasonable Family Hotel. We stayed here on a 9 night vacation in San Diego. We had a tremendous deal that could not be beat for the amenities this hotel provided. Our kids (ages 4 6) loved swimming in the pool just about daily. Although I enjoyed the hot tub, the drains maybe were plugged since a couple nights the water was spilling over with n a couple people in the hot tub. However I did not notify staff-so I am not complaining, it seemed resolved in subsequent nights.We did have an issue we reported to request a new tub drain plug/stopper and never did get one. We requested twice and the second time was two days before we left so when the kids took baths that night we just made do since we weren't going to wait for maintenance during the bedtime hours.All in ill we had and enjoyable trip and this was a tremendous centralized location for all the sites we wanted to see.
1	A little old-fashioned gem in La Jolla. This is a little gem within easy driving distance from San Diego airport. Valet parking exclusively, i.e. no self parking. The hotel is in a park setting and very quiet and restful, not to mention beautiful. The rooms are old-fashioned, including almost no electrical outlets. Free WiFi of reasonable speed. Small work area. Excellent little coffee maker. Bottled water and a bottle of wine included in price. The bed was comfy and the bathroom clean and excellently appointed with high end towels and shampoo etc. Several dining and bar options on site. Staff is first class.Dear DX-Traveler,Thank you for choosing Estancia and for sharing your review. We appreciate your excellent rating. Were so pleased that you enjoyed the beauty of our resort and appreciated the comfort of your accommodations, the multiple dining options, and the hospitality of our staff. It was our pleasure to welcome you to Estancia and we hope to do so again soon.
1	Shawn's Stay Ramada BWI. The desk clerk Jasmine was super nice and the room was comfortable. I would definitely stay there again and while the hotel is a older venue it was clean and offers free shuttle service and continental breakfast which are nice amenities as other venues don't offer these simple accommodations. There is a restaurant on-site which can be accessed within the hotel which is nice as you don't have to go outside (it rained for a couple hours - LOL). I would recommend a modification to the menu to offer more selections. I had the calamari which was okay (I've had better and the potato skins (I've had better) but they both satisfied my hunger so all good on that end. Upon check-out final bill was ready and shuttle was on time. i did forget to tip the driver which I didn't think about initially as i was focused on getting my bags checked in so this CA lady do apologize for that.
0	A hostel in a dated building. The one who checked me in doesn't know how to smile, the whole building is showing age, even the beds are showing age, the elevator hasn't been changed since they built the building, you will get a free pancakes if you wanna stand for half an hour and sometimes for more than that, bathrooms are not so clean, the lockers are located only on the first floor and you can use it if you have your own padlock, location is great,
0	The absolute worst check in experience of my life. So the hotel has a shuttle service from the airport that they told me about when I contacted them earlier in the day. Very pleasant lady I spoke with and extremely helpful. Got off the plane and called to let them know we were here. The driver will be there shortly (remember that phrase, there's a pattern here). Waited 20 minutes and called back same phrase. Did that twice more. The last time I called with attitude she told me the driver had just picked someone up on the A side and after he dropped them off, they would come back for us (the A spots were just across the street). Well, I was none too pleased to put it mildly after waiting that long. Had she been upfront with us, we would have taken a cab the 1 mile or so, which we ended up doing. When we got here to check in, her comment was, instead of I'm sorry for the inconvenience, it was not my problem, they are short a driver tonight. What!!! When I asked to speak to a manager, she said no, there is no manager here and you can deal with me. WHAT!!! It went downhill from there. Can't believe the attitude that was being thrown my way from some twenty year old. Finally just took my keys and left (fortunately I had already checked in online) was a long day. The rooms were adequate although there were mystery smears on the inside of the bathroom door. Went to speak with the front desk this morning but he was again a twenty year old (I guess get done with high school and start working at the hilton). Well, luckily again, I have more Hilton Honors points than I can ever use (and have in the past loved the customer service they provide) at least I didn't have to pay for this experience. There are so many other hotels right here, I suggest avoiding this Hilton at all costs. Looking forward to putting this ordeal behind me and getting on the cruise ship and having the drink of the day.We are very sorry to have provided you with a poor lodging experience and for this, please accept my personal apologies. I am working with my team to address your concerns and you can be assured that corrective actions will be taken to improve our service. Thank you again for your candid review, as we cannot better serve our guests without feedback such as yours. I hope you will give us another chance to accommodate your needs the next time your travels bring you to the area. Sincerely,Michael GoldwasserGeneral Manager
0	Where is the Aloha spirit. I wish it was just a bad dream but this nightmare was REAL. Perhaps if you are a couple or a man is with you, it's possible you might get treated fairly. My daughter and I were treated so poorly I can't believe it happened....More
1	Nice and lovely. My wife and I arrived the hotel at about 10am. It was too early to checkin so we left the luggage and a box of food in hotel. The bell boy was nice and helpful. We went back hotel about 10pm. The room was ready though not upgraded. We were so tried and soon fell asleep. The next morning I tried to get into the lounge on top floor but the room key just doesn't work. I was thinking that my Gold elite might not have the perks for the reward night so we decided to find our breakfast in airport. I asked the front desk about the rule of lounge access. I was told that I should have access but somehow the key wasn't function properly so he asked the restaurant to pack two cups of chicken noodle soup for us. That was so warm in the windy city. Am I too easy going lol
1	Beautiful patio with pool and palm trees for breakfast and swimming.. The staff was the other best thing about this hotel. They were very friendly and efficient, getting our keys replaced (twice), killing the ants eating my birthday cake and clearing the stopped up toilet.This is an older hotel, but the price is reasonable, it was clean and it has a great location near downtown and a mega shopping center. The rooms have some wear, but were roomy with a bedroom and sitting room. There was also free wi-fi, breakfast, computer room, refrigerator, micro and pool. Parking was 12. per night.Nice place if you're not too picky and can keep a sense of humor.Dear guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your comments regarding your resent stay with us. We are so glad to hear we were able to meet your needs and expectations. looking forward to seeing you back again soon. thank you again for your wonderful comments. )Kind regards,Laura Benson
1	Very good choice in Napa valley. Second time for us in this hotel, and as before very nice place. Location is excellent to visit the Napa valley area. Centrally located to visit the wineries and near the downtown area. Staff is very nice and helpful. Accomodations very good. We had an issue the second night where we requested a change of room because we had a very noisy and rowdy family in the room above us. The type of inconsiderate people existent in todays society. It is not the hotels fault. Vincent, in the front desk, was very helpful in getting us another room in the 3rd floor.It pleases us to know you had a good time while visiting our hotel, thank you very much for taking the time to share your review. You are welcome back anytime!Hilton Garden Inn Napa Management
0	Great location, but worn and old. Room was dark, and smelled musty. Everything was well worn and in dire need up updating. Very mundane bathroom. Front desk staff was indifferent at best. I was so bad, we changed our stay from two nights to one and moved to a Hilton Garden Inn that was far better.
0	visiting my UCF daughter. Friday morning we were awoken by landscapers at 7:00 am. Now we are on vacation it would have been nice if they started a little later. Also, our second night our room was not made up or clean towels when we arrived back at 11pm. When we asked why at the front desk we were told because we had the Do not disturb sign on our door still at 10am. However someone was in our room because our air conditioner was shut off. The front desk staff both at night and the next morning basically did not care because we booked through Expedia and not them. The staff for the continental breakfast were so sweet polite and helpful. I enjoyed seeing them every morning.Our last night all we heard all night was a dog barking. Again the staff said Well people sneak dogs in. And then pretty much shrugged there shoulder in a not caring action.I will definitely not stay here again when I visit my daughter at school.
0	Staying in this hotel was a big mistake. For starters, the reception staff treats the guestsas a potential thief... They ask a document to be signed by all guests with the price list of all the items in the room, including bulbs that will cost 25 usd or so each...Rooms at outdated, smelly and badly maintained.I would never stay in this hotel and would not recommend it to anyone either.
0	G-H-E-T-T-O. Management favors drug dealers, prostitutes and lots of short-term visitors to their rooms at all hours. Numerous signs warning that they are not responsible for your vehicle or its contents even though there is a security guard around. Avoid this neighborhood!
1	Clean Comfy. My stay at this hotel was great! The room was clean, the king bed was so comfortable, and the breakfast options were on-point! The staff was very friendly and helpful answering any questions I had. The breakfast options varied with options each day (which is good)! And, this may sound strange, but the hallways smelled so fragrant. This shows that they maintain their appearance and uphold a clean standard (which is very important)! Overall, here are a few reasons why I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the area: 1- friendly staff 2- very clean and well, maintained rooms AND building 3- FREE parking!!!! 4- breakfast is plentiful Enjoy!
0	A Diamond in the Rough. The old Aztec Hotel on foothill blvd, ( route 66) was a gem, back in its day. Unfortunately for the past ten years while the hotel was under poor management it was never maintained. The entire establishment is dirty and run down. The rooms are very small, which was typical for hotels during that era. Some staff are friendly, others were not willing to help when needed. Bar is a local hangout with a pretty good Band. The property needs a complete overhaul.
1	Pleasure trip to San Diego. good, clean and convenient, price was right,personnel very accommodating--a little hard to find some places due to no signage--would go again--food was very good at breakfast and service excellent. would ck out ref. before if needed..ours wasn't connected and didn't work when connected..but we had a cooler.Dear GuestThank you for taking the time to complete our online survey regarding your recent stay at our hotel.

0	Dissappointed!. We took our two kids to stay at this hotel and we had so many undesireable problems during our one night stay, it really ruined the trip. My kids and I got stuck in the elevator which scared my kids to death and they were afraid to get back on the elevator. This was a problem since our room was on the 27th floor. We ordered desert from room service and only got half of what was supposed to come with it and the guy acted put out when I asked him to go and get the rest of the order. The jets on the hot tub were not working, the steam room was not working, and the room with the pool was all gross and really worn down. Our blankets had stains on them in the room and the toilet ran for 45 minutes after flushing which was really loud throughout the room. Housekeeping came and knocked on the door at 8am even though we had the do not disturb sign out. For a four star hotel it lacks the amenities you would expect. Internet was extra and we had to pay $15/day to park. The only good thing was the location and the view was great! Other than that, a huge dissappointment and not worth the money! The worst part was that no one even cared to ask about my stay when we checked out...
0	rude customer service. I was extremely disappointed in the customer service I received from the wait staff for breakfast, it was the managers wife which is even worse, she was very rude and nasty, it was the way that she told us that we had to have shoes on our feet to be in the breakfast area which it was not posted anywhere,... More
0	Hotel Abri - Very Poor Visit. We arrived to check-in at 4pm. The person at the counter did not acknowledge us for 20 minutes while she casually talked to the customer in front. Then when it was our turn, our room was not available (and should have been ready at 3pm). When we arrived back later to settle in for the evening at 9pm, there was again a 10 minute wait at the counter. They gave us a gift bag for our inconvenience. The wine in the gift bag turned out to be rotten or corked. Now this bordered on absurd. The room itself was fine. When I asked to speak to the manager on our way out in the morning the receptionist said that he was not available, but would email me. It was truly a terrible example of customer service.Ms. Sara Z , Let me start this response by apologizing to both of you in regards to the overall experience you had at our hotel, as we can see we failed to meet your basic guest needs. Our goal is to exceed each one of our guests requests and expectations, but unfortunately due to the high occupancy and number of guests on Friday Saturday, we failed to provide you with personalized service and attention during your arrival and throughout. We are happy to hear that the upgraded accommodations to our Urban suite was up to your standards. Also regarding the gift bag and wine, our sincere apologies, as we provide about 30 gift bags per day and we have not had this situation happened before, we update our wines every month with different themes and varietals, we wish you had informed us of the wine during your visit, so we could have addressed on site, as we have a great partnership with Local Small Vineyards and the relationship is very strong to provide our guests with the best possible experience. I am sorry we missed you during your checkout, as our Manager on Duty was available and expecting you. We hope that you would provide us the opportunity to further discuss the details of your stay you can contact me directly at 415.392.8800. We look forward to your response. Thank you again for your time and honest feedback. Have a great weekend!EJ Varela Hotel Manager
1	A Hidden Gem of a Hotel!!. Stayed at this Hotel with my wife and 14yr old son for four nights last week and it was faultless. You could easily drive past it when travelling down 6th Street but what a find. Staff at reception were very friendly and helpful as were the young staff at the entrance. The room we had was a 'suite' was perfect. Nice large living room area with a separate bedroom and large bathroom which included a Jacuzzi type large bath and separate shower. My only criticism is that the mattress on the large sofa bed which my son used was a bit rock solid!! Fridge in the living room was very handy with a large TV and another TV in the bedroom. As for the facilities in the hotel the outdoor pool and terrace area was excellent. Spotlessly clean there were plenty of sun loungers, cabana type rest areas (complimentary) as well as other soft seated areas with the bonus of a few 'fire-pits' which came on later in the evening to sit by. There was also a 'get together' hour daily between 5pm 6pm, either in the Hotel lobby or the adjoining 'J Six' bar. This comprised of free wine/beer and snacks and was very enjoyable. Also you had free coffee/tea every morning available in the Lobby area. The Hotel location is also excellent. One block away from the busy 'Gaslamp quarter' with many eating/drinking options, a ten minute walk to the Harbour area and only a couple of minutes walk from 'Petco Park' where the San Diego Padres baseball team play. All in all I cannot fault this hotel....staff were so helpful and friendly, room excellent and the pool bar area a delight to use. San Diego impressed me a lot and if I visit again I will be booking this Hotel without a doubt!!What a lovely review, thank you dingomell! I could not be happier to read all about your visit to the hotel, it sounds like you had a wonderful visit. I appreciate the feedback regarding the pull-out sofa beds, we will certainly take a look at those to see if we can do something about that, thank you for sharing your sons experience with that sofabed. I was particularly pleased to see that you enjoyed the little extra amenities we offer like the social hour and amenities at the pool deck. I love that there is no hesitation to come back and see us again. See you soon! Cheers! Shannon
0	worse than our first visit in September. I have pictures of dirty linen, stained duvet covers, no cups in the breakfast bar, no butter, curtains torn. At breakfast we spoke with another couple who called and demanded clean towels also
1	Beautiful hotel and overall a good stay.. Minor issue with front desk staff.. My family and I stayed at the Chicago Marroitt O'hare from July 10th-12th to attend the Chicago tastefest of 2015. My family (4 adults) and I arrived at the hotel at around 4pm to check in (check in was said to be 3pm) not knowing it was same weekend the college referees we having a convention there thus the check in process was horrible. I booked a room with two queen beds and was told it was a guarantee. Thus after waiting 1 hour to finish the check in process I was told my room was no longer available that my family and I (3 other adults) would only be given a room with a king bed (unacceptable). Finally when I demanded to speak with a manager things turned around. I would have given this hotel 5 stars for the great location, the upgrades, and quality of the rooms except the front desk staff ruined that.
1	Perfect location well worth the. Everything wad great we were down there for st Patrick's day.rooms were clean,kinda small for 4 people but we weren't in room much.very clean grounds and well kept up. Beds were very comfy or we were just to drunk and tired to really care.the breakfast in the morning was good but u would think that where it is it would have longer hours . 9:30 they remove all food . The parking lot was not ment for large trucks kinda tight. But there is nothing that would keep me from returning again and again . People were very nice...loved it
1	Clean Pet friendly. Very convient location, but a little difficult to get to off the interstate.. You need to make a right at the light and make a U turn. The room was nice size, had a fridge and micro. No oder untill we turned on the AC unit.. nothing a little frebreeze in the filter didnt fix. The walls were a little thin, but didnt matter much, as the puppy heard everything and anything from a mile away.. hahahaha.....The front desk folks were just great. Some of the friendliest I have run across in hotels. Breakfest was good, Waffels, cereal, juice, coffee.. ect. Will def stay there again because of the pet friendly/no fee.
1	Very nice. Very nice hotel, quiet, good service and clean rooms. Yes it is expensive but location is fantastic, service is very good so don t complain , you know price in advance and you are in Center of San Francisco.We are so pleased to read you had such an enjoyable visit. True parts of the year are pricier than others, but we do our best to ensure the same good service all year round. Our housekeeping team works thoroughly to make certain rooms are clean and tidy while the front office shares their knowledge of the city and gets folks pointed in the right direction. All of us here hope to see you again in the near future.Kind regardsQuinn McEnteeFront Office Manager
0	Bad Bed and Service. The bed was one of those firmness adjustable beds, however one side did not maintain the setting I set and I kept sinking in the bed. I asked to be moved to another room but they would not. They said they will come to fix it, but couldn't. Slept horrible for 3 nights because of the bed. So I may not stay at this location again.Dear Hemal, thank you for sharing your concerns regarding your stay with us. I am sorry to hear that my associates were not attentive to your needs and were not responsive to your issues regarding the adjustable bed in your guest room not working correctly. I can assure you that this will be addressed with the proper team members so that this is not repeated again and we will work on providing better solutions to guest needs. Thank you again for sharing your observations, and please let me know if your plans return you to this area, as I would like to personally see to your reservation needs. I hope to welcome you back again soon!All the Best,Debra Thompson-French,General Manager
0	Dirty hotel but friendly staff. I will start with the only positive. The staff at the front desk, restaurant and bar areas were friendly and accommodating. The hotel itself was rather disgusting. The decor is gaudy and dated. Even accounting for that subjective opinion (design styles can differ of course, some of my colleagues liked the ambiance) the cleanliness was lacking. Upon checkin my room had hairs on the bathroom counter and the floor had not been mopped. The bathtub was filthy. The carpet areas were stained. The climate control in the room was terrible. Instead of a thermostat there was the old style manual control box AC unit under the window. It didn't work properly and it was LOUD. So the options were either freezing cold or humid and muggy (considering it was almost 40 degrees and humid in Dallas at the time of my stay). It was near impossible to get a comfortable sleep. The air unit was loud and the only settings available was max or off. I would get too cold, turn it off, then get too hot and in the middle of the night get up and turn it back on. This was repeated all night for the 3 nights I stayed. Suffice to say I slept maybe 4-5 hours in total. I would never recommend anyone stay here unless it was necessary and there were no other alternatives. One other note, be careful if you take the shuttle somewhere. My coworkers and I took a shuttle to a nearby restaurant and told the driver to come back and pick us up by 10pm. Well he never showed and after waiting 15min we called the hotel. That driver had left his shift and not told his replacement. So we were finally picked up at almost 1045pm. That driver was apologetic and it wasn't his fault.

1	Comfortable boutique hotel, conveniently located. The hotel is very conveniently located, right in the heart of the Gaslamp Quarter with plenty of good restaurants within walking distance. The room was spacious and nicely decorated. Breakfast is in the adjoining JSix restaurant and their eggs were a superb way to set you up for the day. San Diego is a great city to visit and I would thoroughly recommend this hotel for your stay.There is just so much happiness KeithH1955 - what a fantastic review! Im so glad we exceeded your expectations and can't thank you enough for your recommendation. I couldn't agree more that JSix is the best way to begin your day. We cant wait to have you back again soon! Cheers! Shannon Foster
1	Great place to stay for a Braves game!. My boyfriend and I stayed here for opening day of SunTrust Park. It was the perfect place to stay. We were able to park at the hotel and walk to the game in less than 10 minutes. I would defiantly recommend this hotel to anyone in town for a game. There wasnt any traffic getting to the hotel and the room was bigger than I expected and very clean. Will be staying her again. Dear Mr. Matthew0917,Thank you so much for all of your feedback. I will definitely share this information with my entire staff. The Wingate by Wyndham hotel is looking forward for to your next visit to Atlanta please feel free to contact us for any request.

1	Perfect weekend get-away for Holiday Events in Pacific Beach. I was pleasantly pleased with our stay at the Ocean Park Inn. I booked at this Inn primarily due to its location. We were there for Pacific Beach's annual Holiday Parade (there were also Santa Run marathons) and we wanted a hotel that we could easily walk to and from the Parade Route that took place on Garnet Ave.The price seemed reasonable. I booked a King room with Partial View for 2 nights. The room choice was honored when I checked in, and readily available for me.I was greeted by a friendly staff at the front desk. The check in process was quick, but thorough... everything was explained to me: key card use, parking garage, breakfast hours, etc etc. The lobby had two very nice salt water fish aquariums that gave the atmosphere a cozy tropical beach feel even in December. The parking garage is underground, entrance is just to the right of the main lobby driveway. It's a tight entrance and exit, but the parking garage seems secured, and well-lit. The elevator back up to the lobby and room floors are right dead-center of the parking garage, so every spot is nice. But the way there is only one elevator on the property, but it never ever seemed too crowded or long of a wait any time we needed to use it. Getting off the elevator and then roaming the halls (3rd floor) that's when you realize how old the building is. You can tell that there are newer remodeling features such as the flooring and crown molding. There are plenty of windows all along the hallways, so it felt bright and fresh, unlike some hotels that have dark, no-window hallways. The curtains were simple and plain. We found our King room (313) to be very spacious. Dresser, desk, sofa, king bed. Patio had a table and 2 chairs to sit down and enjoy the view of the pool below and ocean straight ahead.The bathroom was fresh and remodeled (definitely new compared to the rest of the inn. It was also fairly roomy and had a big shower- and good for very tall people as I saw the shower head was very high. Plenty of bath towels in a basket, as well as 2 blue beach towels which remained unused during this December visit.The closet is almost hidden as the door for it is actually a nice full size mirror. Once you pull the mirror door open, you'll find two of the most luxurious, double-layer terry cloth bath robes hanging for you (These robes are so comfy that we bought some to take home!!! The staff was kind to bring brand new ones for me to purchase).The bed was fairly comfortable... Firm (which is best for your back), but not rock hard. The white sheets and duvet were clean, fresh, and cozy. I fell asleep very easily. It remained quiet through the night, so either we had very quiet neighbors or decent thickness walls. -- A/C unit worked well... too well. Brrrr. Cooled the room down quickly then kept off. I could imagine it would be wonderful for summer.Things to note:-- Overnight parking is 15/day (compared to the other public parking lots available in this beach community, this was a good deal) and is in a gated underground lot. -- The entire property has a No-smoking policy, even outside on the patios. So if you are a smoker... this could be a deal breaker.-- Beach is literally steps away. You are right there.-- Continental breakfast includes a fancy Waffle maker... actually very good results and yummy even if you don't know how to cook. Everything else is your typical continental breakfast: bagels, toast, cereal, fruit, yogurt, coffee, juices. Breakfast ends at 10am.-- I was surprised to find that you could get room service at this little Inn! Room Service is provided by the neighboring restaurant Firehouse. We didn't get to partake, but the menu looked wonderful. Because it comes from an actual restaurant conveniently next door, the options were plentiful and prices reasonable compared to most big hotel in-house room service.-- You are walking distance from so many restaurants, bars, convenient stores, market, and even a CVS pharmacy. Overall, we had a wonderful stay at Ocean Park Inn. Pacific Beach is a neat little beach community. We got to experience it when the city was hosting a Santa Run marathon and a parade, so the activity was pretty ramped up. But even so, if anyone wanted to have a nice trip to the beach where you can just enjoy yourself at anytime of the year, I would recommend this place for sure.Thank you for taking the time to write a review for Ocean Park Inn.We are so pleased to read that we were able to provide you with an incredible experience. We are very fortunate for our one of a kind location and amazing staff. Your detail review painted a wonderful picture of what travelers can expect from Ocean Park Inn. As I'm sure, many future travelers would find your review to be very helpful. I love that you enjoyed our comfortable bath robes and even purchase some to take home with you. Next time you are looking to make another trip down to San Diego, I am so pleased to hear that you will return to us and would recommend us. We are all looking forward to providing you with another memorable experience.

1	Great price and location. Close to everything in Napa!. We spent four days at this hotel and it was a good experience. We wanted to visit Napa Valley but many on the inns and hotels are very expensive. We certainly were not planning to spend much time at the hotel and just wanted something comfortable and convenient. It is located a 5 minute drive from downtown Napa and 10 minutes away from the Wine Train Station. There are many things nearby if you need stuff. There is a Dennys next to the hotel and a Target, Applebees, IHOP and many more fast food restaurants just across the road. Since we were traveling with kids it was good to have different options. The hotel is very basic but well-kept. The rooms are big and comfortable and so is the bathroom. There is a tiny pool and hot tub outside. The kids liked that. We enjoyed our experience there.We are very happy that you, our world travlers from China, enjoyed your stay with us. If you ever get back to Napa we look foward to being your home away from home again.
0	not what we expected. The hotel is listed as near Bricktown. I guess that would depend on your definition of near. Near to me would be near the Pilot truckstop as it was next door. Our room was clean, but you could walk to the pool an see other rooms that were not. Many had mattresses propped up against the wall, and almost all the second floor rooms had pillows stuffed in the a/c units. You could see all this through the windows of the parking lot because lots of the sliding glass door curtains were open or missing pieces. It honestly looked like they were fixing it one room at a time. I don't know how old the hotel is, but it is far from being completely renovated. I think hotels.com should do more research on the hotels they show with a 4 star rating. The two star the hotel showed was more accurate.
1	Modern hotel with a great in-house restaurant/bar!. I came down for a work event, and I chose this hotel mainly for its proximity to the event site, but I ended up having dinner at the restaurant on the 11th floor, which offered great happy hour and fantastic views. It was convenient having those options on-site, as I had driven far to get there, and didn't want to have to get back in the car to find a place to eat. My only complaint is that the hotel is valet-only, which results in unexpected expenses because I felt obligated to tip the valet drivers each time, but that's not a huge deal.
0	This is a Crown Plaza. This had to be the worst Crown Plaza I have ever stayed. I stayed 2 nights to attend a wedding and I didn't sleep at all. Aside from the tired/boring decor, the room had a supposed queen bed that really should be classified as full size with a mattress harder than a sidewalk and pillows flatter than a short stack...

She certainly makes it clear your word isn't good enough unless she can see the messed up room details for herself.... More
0	Don't stay here.....Please!!!!. The rooms are small and the beds are uncomfortable. The bathroom is very small and the shower area in the room is made for a child to use. Please consider another hotel. It is no use of getting up early to get breakfast at this hotel because it is TERRIBLE. I would not recommend this hotel to anybody. I would tell you to stay away from it. It is not up to par with other Best Western Plus hotels that they have in other locations across the country.
1	Comfortable hotel near the beach. Had a really nice stay at hotel renew. Was close to the beach near to where they have a concrete break to stop the waves crashing, so would be good for young families. The bed was really comfy. Only a couple of negatives, the room we were in had a window in the bathroom, and a frosted glass door to the bathroom. This meant light streamed in through the window and door in the morning. Also there wasn't much for breakfast if you are trying to avoid sugar and there wasn't a lot of space.Aloha!!!Mahalo nui loa (thank you very much) for choosing to stay with us and for providing valuable feedback of your experience.

0	Another Motel ruined by India's ownership. This is another typical motel run down by the ownership of a person from India. I will give them credit as the sheets were clean however the shower stall was dirty, there was no shower head just a pipe, the towels were stained and the carpet was so dark you couldn't tell if it was clean or not. The swimming... More
1	Great for Airport Access. This is a typical Hilton Garden Inn with room setups the same as all of this brand across the country. On site restaurant for dinner and breakfast with good food at a fair price.PROS:Close to the airport, but not noisyVery very cleanComfy Sleep Number beds with comfortable linensDecent pillowsBathroom lighting is goodPlenty of hot water with good water pressureIn room fridge, coffee maker, etc.Very good customer service attentive and polite.Free wifiShuttle to the airport took about ten minutesCONS:None that I can really think of! Got a decent rate that included breakfast, shuttle was on time, staff was great. No reason to avoid this hotel. If you need to be close to the airport at a good price with a clean, comfortable place to stay, this is a fine choice.Good Day TravelMommy1,On behalf of the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport team, thank you for sharing your wonderful comments regarding our performance and experience during your stay.

1	Perfect location. Our first time staying at the Ocean Park Inn. We have walked by this nice hotel many times while visiting our son in Ca. We usually stay at a resort up the street but decided that since we were only going to be in town for one night let's try and stay on the ocean. What a wonderful surprise! Room was clean and comfortable. Bathroom appeared to be newly remodeled and quiet nice. Front desk clerks that checked us in and out went out of their way to make us feel very welcome. Loved the fresh fruit upon checking in. The parking garage under the hotel was a plus! Can't wait to return in the fall for a longer stay.Thank you for your kind words, we are so glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us at the Ocean Park Inn! We are looking forward to welcoming you back in the fall!
0	Breakfast - poor. 6am breakfast (and then that's late) ... an international airport should be at 5:30am at the latest quality of the food was well below normal Hampton Inn standards staff were helpful by constrained by hotel policyThank you for your feedback in regards to your recent stay at the Hampton Inn Philadelphia Airport. We apologize for the inconvenience that your received throughout your stay regarding Breakfast. We do hope that you will try us again soon if your travels should bring you back to Philadelphia.Director of Sales
1	Hotel with Town Character. We really enjoyed staying at this hotel. It is right in the heart of Old Town, and has the theme of the area. The breakfast was very nice as well. Only negative is the bed was a bit harder than I prefer, but pillows were good.Thank you for your excellent review! Its always great to hear when our location, ambiance and amenities work out well. It sounds like youve been a guest before and appreciate you choosing us again. Dont hesitate to reach out to me if there is ever anything I can assist with. We research the purchase beds that satisfy the majority of guests but let us know if there is an issue so we can see what can be done.Safe travels! Regards,Ryan AguinaldoDirector of Sales and Marketing
1	Birthday Party. I've never wrote a review on any place I've ever stayed at before. After staying at the Pantai Inn I felt that I had to do something to say Thank You! Best stay at any place I've ever had. The Staff and service was amazing! Great location with plenty of nice shopping and restaurants nearby. I will be coming back.Greetings newfarmkid,Thank you for taking the time to review Pantai Inn.We are most honored to be your first review! It means the world to both myself and our team that you took the time to share your experience with other potential and longtime guests. We appreciate your need to say thank you following your stay. However, we THANK YOU for choosing us and allowing us to participate in the birthday celebration.Come back and give us the opportunity to WOW you again!Thanks!Mike
1	Convenient location, Great Room.. Great place right next to China Town and Union Square. Lots of eco-features, quiet room with view of the financial district on 10th floor. The room was very clean - both spouse and I are suffering from dustmite allergy and had no problems here.Thank you so much for taking time to write about your experience while staying with us. As an eco-friendly hotel we only use green seal certified cleaning products for dusting and cleaning. We are very happy to able to accommodate people with sensitive allergies. We hope that you decide to stay with us again.Kind regards,Quinn McEntee
0	Awful!. I have stayed in some hotels in my time, but this was bad. If you want to experience an awful nights sleep, nasty ignorant staff, then this is for you. Southern hospitality it is not. I was not impressed with the layout of the room and the noise next door was horrendous.Thank you for taking time out of your day to share your comments about your recent stay with me. Please accept my sincere apologies for the difficulties and situations you encountered during your visit, I would like to find out a little bit more about the interaction with the staff so i can address approporately. Rest assured we will address each item with our team for immediate correction. It was disheartening that your first visit with us was disappointing.I truly would love to have the opportunity to have you back as our guest and show you our true service standards. Would you be willing to visit us again Please contact me directly at Dixie.Kraussaloftneworleansdowntown.com to discuss.
1	Great Business Hotel. I have stayed at this hotel many times when visiting Dallas fro a trade fair and the hotel and staff continue to do a great job.The front desk is very helpful and attentive to your needs. the hotel lobby has been undergoing a renovation but you would never know it as the lobby is clean and disruptions kept to a minimum.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for taking the time to fill out the Trip Advisor Survey. We greatly appreciate your response and I will share your comments with my staff. We hope to see you when your travels bring you back to Dallas.
0	Don't Understand the meaning of DO NOT DISTURB. Most personnel of the hotel barely speak English and few understand it. Questionable as to the legality of some of the cleaning personnel. Questions could not be answered because they couldn't understand Management was more concerned with than the guests privacy. Was supposed to receive a discount, which I got partial a few days later, but the management was... More
1	What a gem!!!. This property was delightful in every way -- the perfect place to celebrate my birthday! The decor was unique and our rooms were very comfortable, functional and stylish,. The pool view afforded us a surprisingly quiet stay, particularly given the proximity to Duval Street. Paul and Tripp at the bar were both amazing, each in his own way. They are artists behind the bar, brewing (literally sometimes) concoctions that are different from anything I've ever tasted, but each was really special. And what can I say about Andrew in the kitchen He cooked our tuna and snapper catch in 3 courses, and they were nothing short of magnificent. Again, like nothing I've ever had before. I LOVE this place, and will undoubtedly be back again, hopefully before too long!Thank you so much for your review, we are so delighted your birthday was a success. It tickles me to hear all the great evaluations you have for our staff. I must mention Andrew has this unequivocal desire to please, he lives to see peoples expressions after their first bite. Its good to know we've made a new friend, hope to see you again soon.
0	Never more. First impression was positive. However in 5 minutes I discovered that Wi-Fi doesn't work in the room. I asked a manager, she promised to repair it on the next day. I spend three nights in the hotel and nothing was changed with Wi-Fi. I had to work in garden (Wi-Fi worked outside), sometimes under grass sprinkles. Morning coffee finishes by 10 am. Living cockroaches in the room and dead in the bad. Afro-Americans knock to the door and ask for gasoline for their car because of pregnant wife. One positive point - 55 for a night, however I recommend to demolish it.
1	A good deal.. Due to LOSSAN performing track maintenance, I wound up spending a few days in San Diego. When I saw the rate, I grabbed it because, honestly, I was curious.What really makes this hotel good is the staff. That goes double with the staff at the restaurant who really stood out and made the place great.The room was good, but not great. It did, however get the job done and I was well rested and got some work done. Under the right circumstances, I would stay again.Thank you for choosing the Best Western Seven Seas in San Diego and for being our guest! We truly appreciate your kind words in regards to your recent stay at our hotel. We will be sharing your nice comments with our Staff members. We look forward to welcoming you back on your next trip to San Diego!
0	NOT IMPRESSED. Coffee Pot Leaks and does not make HOT coffee. Had to request Toilet Paper TWICE. NOT the Worst we've stayed but FAR FROM THE BEST for that price.
0	HORRIBLE. From the time we pulled into the parking lot, then we went in and the smell was horrible. went to the room, the hallways smelled of smoke. and the room was ok. no wash cloths and no sheets or blankets for the pull out bed..The stay was no pleasant at all.Please accept our sincere apologies for the problems you encountered. You deserved a comfortable and stress-free stay, and we did not live up to your expectations. We assure you that what you experienced is not acceptable, and we will take immediate action to identify why we failed, so we can prevent these issues from occurring again. We deeply regret the inconvenience caused, and please give us another opportunity to serve you better in the future. Sincerely,General Manager
0	Very poor accommodations. Very disappointed. Motel was clean but lacked amenities. I was charged 79 for a Friday night stay. They advertised 60 for double occupancy. Was told weekend rates were 10 higher Will not recommend this motel.
1	Lack of electricity handled professionally. We were advised well in advance of our stay that there would be a power outage. We decided to stay anyway since we would only be sleeping. We were provided with push lights upon check in. Very clean room! The wood look tile was a welcome change from dingy carpet.Many thanks for your kind review of Ramada Limited San Diego/Near SeaWorld! Our team believes in being proactive and we glad you felt our advance preparation for the power outage was quite professional. With that said, it's great to know that our immaculate accommodations and tile floors met your expectations for a pleasant stay. Your thoughtful praise means a great deal to us and we'd love you to visit us again.
1	A High Five. As it was both of our birthdays and anniversary weekend we asked for an upper floor roorm, quiet, away from the street, in the back. All of our requests were granted. We had a 3rd floor room with a balcony in the back over the pool. Also, the housekeeping staff had made swans out of the towels in shape of a heart which was on our bed. This went way above and beyond. Thank you Melody and All of the BW staff for making our stay memorable. We will definetly be back.Thank you for the High Five! Melody is a great asset to our Hotel and we are glad you enjoyed the swans and your stay. Hope to see you again soon!
0	It's not for me. The overdone maritime theme makes this place creepy. Everything is painted dark blue--it's overwhelming and depressing.
1	Wedding Room Block. Our guests had a fabulous weekend. Rooms were beautiful. Staff were amazing and so accommodating. Comfortable lobby with pool table and games was a great meeting space. We had a light breakfast for our guests the morning after the wedding in the lobby and it worked out great. Would highly recommend Aloft Downtown as the hotel for your wedding guests!Hi Jeanne, Thanks for the FIVE BUBBLES!! It was a thrill to serve the entire wedding party. It was the first time we used W XYZ for a wedding brunch and we're delighted you enjoyed the space. Sorry about the rain, it would have been really cool for your family and friends to enjoy the Backyard. Hope the bride and groom enjoy the honeymoon! We'd love to have all of you back for the anniversaries! Evan
1	Great location great people. The Hotel staff we're incredibly friendly and welcoming. They took care of things for me before I even asked. The breakfast was good with eggs bacon or sausage, a waffle maker, yogurt muffins bagels Etc. The courtyard was nice although it was too cold to swim in the pool in November. Room was clean except for one day when a cleaner left a bag of towels in our room. The location was nice because it was just a few minute walk Into the heart of the French Quarter but far enough away to avoid the noise. Just across the street from Louis Armstrong Park which was also a beautiful place to be.I am pleased to hear you enjoyed our hotel and staff. You are right it was a bit chilly this weekend. I hope the next time you are in New Orleans you will come back and see us. Sincerely, Chastity
1	Strange beginnings. When we 1st arrived the staff was extremely friendly. The check in was swift as far as check ins go but they checked us in to an already occupied room. OMG! Can you imagine entering your room family in tow and there is someone sleeping in the bed. I was frighten, embarrassed and angry. We returned downstairs and the couple was already calling down about the intrusion. The staff apologized profusely and immediately gave us an empty room. Needless to say I had a hard time sleeping that night worried that someone might walk into our room but that never happened. The rest of the stay was worry free. The only other issue was the breakfast time. Breakfast at the Hyatt Place was from 6:30am-9am. That's awful early for people traveling with kids or on vacation. I'd like to take a moment to thank the staff. They were courteous and friendly especially Rosalind and Adriel. Thank you for a nice stay.
0	"Disappointed. We we checked into the hotel, the lady was not very friendly and seemed to be lacking some customer service training. We had to let the water run for, at leas,t 5 minutes before taking a warm (not hot) shower. Also,the t.v. reception kept going in and out. The hotel was not kid/family friendly at all. The only restaurant available for breakfast was a ""sports bar"" that either sat 2 or 6 people and all the tables were the pub style which does not work very well for a 1 and 3 year old. The only option the staff gave us was to eat at another hotel restaurant."
1	Best boutique hotel in Union Square. I travel to San Francisco often being that I live in Los Angeles and my sister lives up there, It is less than a days worth of driving or an hour flight so the city is not difficult for me to get to. I travel up there about once a month and almost every time if I am not staying at my sister's, I will stay at Hotel Diva. Truly for the money you pay at this hotel and the location it is in, considering all the other mega hotels around it, it is totally worth it! I give this hotel 4 stars because truly it is not a 5 star hotel. It is very small but very modern and updated. It is in the middle of union square just walking distance to bars, restaurants, all the shopping you could want and of course Ruby Skye and the Starlight room if you're into those popular attractions. The decor is very modern and hip with lots of black and white everywhere, which I love. Beds are comfortable, space is small but it is more of a boutique style hotel. The people at the front desk are always willing to go above and beyond for their guests and always want to make sure everyone is satisfied. I also love the way the windows actually open in this hotel, so many hotels in the city don't allow you to fully open windows or to open them at all, some are sliding doors with a screen or a small knob that you can crank to crack it open, but I love the single pane that slides up to open and let you get the fresh air! have now stayed there multiple times and I still plan to go back again :)Hi Suzi F,Thank you for staying at Hotel Diva. I'm glad you enjoyed your stay with us. We look forward to seeing you again soon!Best regards,Virgil LopezHotel Manager
1	Great Renovation and excellent customer service changes.. I stay at a Suite at this Grand Hyatt at least 2-3 times a year for at least a week each time. I can say, with a degree of certainty, that they've stepped it up significantly. It's undergoing a renovation. The staff is exceptionally courteous, helpful and professional. I received a letter from Mr. Robert Morrison (Area Director of Rooms) and the assistance of Mr. Steve Vissotzky (Managing Director) and Ms. Sarah Sawatzky (Executive Assistant). I was impressed. I can afford to stay where I wish and it's changes such as this and the staff that make me want to continue to come back.
0	Dead Rat under my Bed - Do NOT stay here.. I was down there for the Cisco Live event in June. The reason I stayed there was because all the recommended hotels by Cisco were full, so this was my only choice.I checked in and was told the restaurant was closed for repairs, i accepted that, but when i got to my room and opened the door I had just realized my nightmare. The bathroom was filthy, the carpets were disgusting with stains and the room had the smell of Death in it. I knew someone else staying there, so I went to their room to see how it was and it was even worse!,,,,what a joke this place is. I tried to login into the wireless, it DID NOT WORK THE ENTIRE DURATION OF MY STAY. After the second night of sleeping in my clothes because of how disgusting the room was, I looked under my bed and low and behold A DEAD RAT.i jumped up, ran to the front desk and told them about it... They did not even look phased, worried or cared and without missing a beat she said all I can do is get you another room.... Please, unless you're from the ghetto and you want to stay somewhere that is rather inexpensive, then don't stay here it will ruin your entire experience... days inn as a company need to review this property, I'm not sure how they let this happen....
0	Very Disappointed. This was my second stay with a Ramada branded hotel. I had such high hopes for our stay since the previous Ramada we stayed with was such a good experience, unfortunately I cannot say the same for this stay. At check in the desk clerk was in my opinion very ill mannered almost rude like she wanted to hurry us... More
1	Mixed Bag at Comfort Suites, Redmond. Overall, the stay was good. The staff, however, was a mixed bag. Lady at front desk was friendly enough, but gave us the wrong times for breakfast (telling us that breakfast was served to 10:00 on Fridays when it really stopped at 9:00 my teenage daughters almost missed breakfast). Also, the woman who drives the early morning shuttle to the airport as well as served breakfast on Wednesday morning was extremely RUDE. Made snarky comments to customers in the breakfast room and left a poor family with small children on their way to the airport, telling them that there was no more room in the shuttle when there was plenty of room. (My family were the only people on the shuttle and we pointed out that there was plenty of room and we were fine with waiting while they loaded on, but she would not wait for them.) On the other hand, the nice brunette, younger woman who worked the breakfast room on Thursday through Saturday morning was super friendly and accommodating and even made extra eggs for my daughters on the morning that they almost missed breakfast.
0	Not a great experience at all.. We have been staying at the Bloomington, MN Super 8 at least one or twice a year and it used to be a good experience. On Saturday, January 16th of 2016, it was not so great. The room we were in had several big issues. Originally, it started out with the room not wanted to warm up. The thermometer I... More
0	What A Dump!. I was expecting the type of property from years past, where the quaint experience of Baleens and the exotic decor reigned. Needless to say, it doesn't even resemble what was. The first experience was with a property manager that appeared to come from a different industry, as he was extremely rude and overwhelming. The fancy elegance with the monkey- theme... More
0	Be warned of the annex. I stayed one night recently in the annex. Sounds like the luxe part of the hotel overlooking the coast is a better bet. Being unfamiliar with the hotel, I was not aware of this. The annex is like a motel. The room was dingy and in need of a good cleaning and some fresh paint. Overall, it just made me feel itchy. The kid at the front desk was a bit snarky, but efficient. Otherwise, valet was fine and I didn't interact much with any other staff to offer comment. I stayed in a suite the Borgata the night before, so admittedly most AC options would've been a letdown. In hindsight I wish I would've just ponied up the money and stayed the Borgata another night. My bad, I guess.
0	Never book the days inn by the airport. It's will be my last time me in my family had the worse experience I've ever had they lady at the desk was rude the maintenance guy whatever he was was rude in his hygiene was terrible also they kept pouring bleach in bleach in the pool while my kids was in it only when we was in the pool tho they could have waited the rooms are small very very small the tv was too my room looked like it was a run u just give away to Someone I hated everything about the days inn I DNT know how my reservations were there I wanted the comfort suite that was across the street from the days inn I want my money back asap that was a waste of time in money to be treated bad and poorly omg
1	Customer Service Check. Good location Check. Great rooms Check, check.. When it comes to spending money on a good hotel, my dollar was not wasted one bit at this property. The hotel is conveniently located and staff is absolutely wonderful and work their hardest to cater to your needs. Customer service is definitely a main focal point of theirs. The rooms are spacious, have big screen TV's, and the beds are beyond comfortable! I literally fell asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow. Would definitely recommend to anyone and everyone. I'll be staying here again.Thank you for taking the time lto let us know how your stay was. We're glad everything was a 'check'. We look forward to see you soon!Thys JonesGeneral Manager
0	Worn and tired hotel masquerading behind a plush foyer. I was placed in this hotel for a medical conference. The quality of the accommodation was poor, 3 star level at the most. The hotel is badly in need of a makeover and I would avoid staying there until the owners decide to do that. The swimming pool is tiny, and the photographs of it are misleading. Overall a disappointing experience. I didmt like the fact that it wasn't possible to open the windows in the room.englishmaninmidtown - It is unfortunate to read you did not enjoy your recent experience at the Westin San Diego. The hotel completed a 15 million renovation in 2014 which included our public areas, meeting space and guestrooms. We are a high rise building in a large downtown city, therefore our building windows do not open. There is an air vent at the window to allow for outside air but the windows unfortunately do not open. This feature assists with noise control as well providing our guests with a heavenly nights rest.I hope you will continue to look to Westin's when traveling as I truly believe our brand and its offerings are the best in the industry. Kind Regards, Alyssa TurowskiGeneral Manager
1	Great Location, Great Value. This is a nice hotel. We checked in with Amber at the front desk, she was very friendly and helpful, even giving us a complimentary room upgrade. This hotel is located in the heart of the shopping district, with Nordstrom Store No1 a block away and Pacific Place across the street.The Good:Awesome Location for business and shopping.Nicely sized and updated roomsVery friendly staff and excellent service.The Bad: The four valet's, who were not busy didn't offer to help us with our bags while we unloaded from the taxi. The TV is a big, nice brand new HD LG flat LED. The signal strength to the tv is so weak that the screen was incredibly dim and hard to see. The hotel does not have HD service. I don't mean to sound petty, but on a weekend away from the kids it is nice for my wife and I to come back and relax and watch a game. I played with settings and could not get it fixed.Overall, I would happily stay here again. It is consistently a great value for such a nice hotel in a premium location. They staff goes out of their way to make you feel welcome and taken care of.
1	Stay in Dallas. Had everything you need for a pleasant stay. Kitchen for a extended stay if needed. Wifi and included breakfast made it a great value! Dear Tim956,Thank you for your kind words regarding your stay at the Hawthorn Suites Dallas Park Central. We were glad to have you as our guest, and appreciate you taking the time to comment regarding your visit with us. We look forward to the opportunity to host you again the next time you are in the Dallas area. Thanks again for being our guest! Best regards, Charlie Westhoven Operations Manager Hawthorn Suites Dallas Park Central
1	Southern Hospitality. I had the pleasure of staying at the Renaissance Waverly while attending a trade show in March 2012. I have attended this show for several years and usually stay at an Embassy Suites across the street. I was pleasantly surprised with the hotel on every level. I was greeted by a smiling face at the front desk, received excellent service at the lobby bar, and enjoyed clean and well kept accommodations during my stay. As a Marriott Rewards gold member I received access to the club lounge which served coffee and pastries in the morning. There is a coffee bar in the lobby where I picked up a snack on my way the the trade show. The person working there kindly offered to warm up my coffee from the club lounge with Starbucks coffee....nice touch! The hotel is conveniently located across from the Cumberland mall which has a plethora of store and restaurants to choose from. I chose P F Chang's! I also did a little shopping at the mall, lots of nice stores to choose from. Over all, this was one of my best hotel experiences in Atlanta. Well done Renaissance Waverly!
1	Great location, nice environment. All around a great business stay with good rooms. Pool/spa could have been a little cleaner but gym was very good with dumbbells, cable machine, and top-end cardio machines. Business lunches were very good and bar was well priced.Ben K,Thank you for reviewing your stay at the Westin San Diego. I am delighted to hear you enjoyed our WestinWorkout Fitness Studio and dining choices. You can get a total body workout with all our equipment and we also offer a gear lending program just in case you forgot to pack workout gear. We provide many SuperFood options in all our outlets to help you make healthy decisions while you travel. We hope to invite you back soon whether for business or leisure.Kind Regards,Alyssa TurowskiGeneral Manager
1	Great location, room and staff fantastic!. Everything about our 1 night stay was great. The location is very convenient to the train and ideal to take in all the holiday sights. The hotel was decorated beautifully and all the staff we encountered from the housekeeping, front desk, bellhop to restaurant staff was excellent and gave great service. I mistakenly left my credit card at the Starbucks rushing out to catch the train and by the time I got to my destination, I got an email from management alerting me to the fact they had it. One call to security and they shipped it back to me and I had it in two days. Thank you Marriott for a great stay in a great city!Thank you very much for your positive comments about our hotel facilities and our outstanding staff. We appreciate your sharing with us the excellent assistance you received in retrieving your credit card which was left behind. We do hope that you will stay with us again during your next visit to Philadelphia.
0	Okay. Location is great for Metro boarding to DC. No one at the front desk at check-in or check-out. Hallways/stairwells do not smell good at all. Exercise room has no sweat towels or sanitizer towels which we have never seen before. Room was slightly dirty upon arrival. No room service during the stay. Had to ask for extra towels and toilet... More
0	Disappointment..... Me and my boyfie we stayed in Casa Loma Hotel for 3 nights and find the experience is not as good as we thought it could be. It was end of the year of 2015, the weather is very cold for us who came from the South East Asia country, what's to be mentioned of our dissatisfaction is the heater in which we were told is centralized that our room is freezing cold even we have requested to adjust the temperature. The service at the front desk as we are noticing the people are keep changing throughout our stay, there are one or two who are on the night shift, the respond to the request of services are rather poor and inefficient, perhaps the hotel can improve on managing the people, we felt we are not properly taken care of. Nevertheless, when we ask for directions or some other questions regarding the area, especially people who are in the morning shift at the front desk are very helpful and friendly. We are glad to have free hot drinks at the lobby and also maps travel guide conveniently provided - especially the Big Bus Tour tickets are available to get from the hotel! Last but not least, the condition of the room is considerably fine, as we booked the room with private bathroom, however the bathroom, on one of the night when it was raining around the area of San Francisco, the hot bath doesn't seems to work properly and we were extremely cold after taking shower, despite the hotel has provided us extra blanket, yet we do hope the hotel will improve on the condition of the room :)
1	Nice Hotel easy access into NY City. We stayed at the Holiday Inn on a weekend shopping trip to NYC. Our flight arrived at 8am and was traveling with my 3 month old baby. They let us check in early which was nice. It was very easy to go to NYC #320 bus just outside the hotel with a 20 min bus ride to Port Authority. Wifi could not access from our room had to go to lobby to get internet. Other then that it was good. Lots of dining options just outside the hotel. Walmart 5 min away. Would stay there again.
0	No Sleep. Bed Bugs !! Motel very old tired. Impossible to fall back to sleep after being eaten alive by bed bugs. Left in early morning hours and sealed my luggage in plastic bag! Motel close to Saratoga Racetrack and the racing season during August fill all the hotels and rates double. Stay away from this motel.
0	DON'T EVER STAY HERE.. I don't normally write bad reviews unless I was extremely unhappy with the experience hence this rating. This is the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. The previous guest had left the toilet clogged and the hotel never bothered to unclog and clean it. When we arrived at the room and notified the front desk, the maintenance guy blamed it... More
0	Good enough. On a good note, this place has nice hot water, the AC keeps the room nice and cold, the staff are helpful, room service seemed to be very efficient, the beds are comfortable enough, and the one meal I had here was pretty good.On the flip side, our room had bugs (most likely due to the gaping crack around the door), a lot of the outlets did not work, the tub always looked like it had sand in the bottom, and the carpeting looks like it is in bad need of replacement.Solely based on my experience, I cannot recommend this place to anyone. Thank you for your comments regarding your recent stay. By telling us what you liked about your stay and how we can improve, you are helping us deliver a superior experience for you and other guests in the future. We are however, pleased to hear you enjoyed our comfortable beds as well as our helpful and efficient staff. Hopefully you will consider staying with us again in the future so that we can have another chance to provide you with an excellent experience. Thank you!
1	Disney Fun. It was a very lovely stay. The room was so beautiful! Beds so comfy!! Pool was so refreshing!! We will stay again! The thing that was troubling, was check-in with one person, part of information was not correct, when I mentioned this, she stated, well you are staying only one night, Let that go, she did mention it several times. Then was telling us, where the room was, kept pointing behind us and saying right back there, repeating it. We didn't look behind us, so she kept pointing, I said do you want us to look behind us to see where you are pointing Eye roll from her! Breakfast ends at 9 and don't take any food out of that area! Let it go. The best part was she informed us of check out, which was 10, not one minute after, repeated it and do we understand! My patience now about gone, about to ask for a manager and tell her a piece of my mind! My very calm my daughter, who is more patience then I just said thank you and took the keys from her. Walked away, went to our room, went to eat and a dip in the pool, let it that go! The night gentlemen, at your front desk was fabulous, the mini fridge started making noise, and sent someone up. We went to eat the pool, it was looked at it. To bad, that the noise had stop, so we both thought it was fixed. When I said something to the front desk (not same lady) that next morning, she said so very sorry and took the resort fee off. The stay was so very nice, had a beautiful garden area!!! Will stay again!!
0	This should be shut down.. Worse place ever.rooms were dirty no clean linen smelly everywhere.Owners were not there to get refund.wish we did not check in.Maid did not want to clean the dirty room said not feeling good.THISPlace is a DUMP!!!
1	Great Choice. First, after reading previous reviews, I was prepared for a small quaint room. We had a King patio and it was quite large. It had 2 areas with a second TV, sofa and coffee table besides the comfortable bedroom area. Yes, the bathroom was small, but larger than a lot of the baths in other Historical hotels we've visited. The lush patio was really sweet and the courtyard around the pool reminiscent of European boutique hotels. The included breakfast is strictly coffee and pastries, but be sure to bypass the bagels for the croissants and sweet breads. The balcony rooms looked charming and faced the courtyard. In all, a great experience.Hello,We sincerely appreciate your positive feedback regarding your time joining us in March. We'd love to have you back for another luxurious stay at Bienville House!Sincerely,Bienville House
0	Don't stay here if you can help it. Did not choose to stop at this motel, was too tired to risk driving further on to New Mexico and the other place in town was booked. The bed was absolutely terrible. There were only 2 pillows, very pathetic pillows might I add, on the bed. The shower pressure wasn't bad, but that didn't matter beings as the drain was... More
0	Terrible Customer Service. Front desk attendant wasn't available on arrival. Had to call her to open the door to let me into the hotel itself- that was a first for me. Then she proceed to be rude through out the check in process. AC was loud as a lawn mover. Kept me up all night. Worst one night stay ever. Big nope.
0	Dirty rooms. The room had a disgusting smell, it was overall dirty, bed and pillows were lumpy and the price was too high for this type of room. Even the towels were rough and needed to be replaced. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the area. I was very sorry I chose this hotel.
0	Worst possible customer service!. I was not impressed with this motel when I stayed there - the breakfast was very mediocre and the toilet didn't want to flush. But it was afterward that I was really appalled by the poor customer service. I know it is my responsibility to keep track of my belongings but sometimes something gets left behind. I left a pair...

0	Disappointing hotel at a good location. I don't want to spend too much time reviewing this hotel. It's simply not worth it. Therefor I will only point out the things I disliked.Unprofessionel people at the reception.Room was not cleaned well. There was still stuff of earlier people in the room.Housekeeping forgot pillowcovers and towels multiple times.Pool was closed for a complete day due to some safety tiles that needed to be added to the pool side. In my opinion, this could have been done in less time.Loud radio was played in the pool area. When I addressed this, I was not taken seriously. The sliding door to the balcony has no insulation, resulting in that all outside sounds and noise would come in the room.Internet was almost non existent. Upload and download speeds were less than 0,5 Mbs.Please consider another hotel for a few dollars more. The location is good, thats it.I will never return to this hotel.I would like to apologize for the inconvenience.Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you gave us to implement improvements to ensure we offer a better experience for guests in the future. I hope that you will consider staying with us again so that we can have another chance to provide you with a superior experience.
1	Luxury in the Midst of Nature. From the moment we arrived at this property we began to fall in love with it. Check-in included a complimentary glass of bubbly --always a nice start to a new relationship. We booked a first floor room that was to our liking, all the conveniences we enjoy. Abundant foliage makes it seem like a secluded nature preserve. The restaurants offer good cuisine as well as plenty of atmosphere. Our favorite place for dinner was the patio of the Mustangs and Burros restaurant. As dusk arrives, the fireplace is lit and the warmth and light adds to an already great experience. The weekend we were there, the hotel hosted five weddings.Thank you for taking the time to share your 5 star feedback with us on Trip Advisor. We agree, a glass of bubbly is always the best way to start a relationship and we are elated to hear you enjoyed it. It is an absolute pleasure to read your commentary regarding you dining experience at Mustangs Burros as well as the beautiful atmosphere the resort has to offer. We certainly hope we are able to welcome you back in the near future, and want to thank you again for such a wonderful review.
1	Excellent Location. Ocean Park Inn is right on the beach. There is access that exits to the boardwalk and from there is beach access. Our room was ocean front. Our 3rd floor room had a balcony that looked down on the boardwalk and beach. We sat in the room because it was chilly out and watched the sunset. How great to open the door and hear the roar of the waves. Our room was nice. A little old but clean and quiet. The one negative is that the room was dark when the sun went down. There is breakfast daily. Underground parking that cost 15 a day. There are plenty restaurants with walking distance.
1	Great bar menu. Picked the W for a weekend trip with my boyfriend and wanted to stay somewhere trendy downtown. We were most impressed with the bar - friendly service and great menu (tater tots poke plate were fab!). Booked a spectacular room with a view. View was just looking at a big building (see pic), not a cityscape like I hoped, but I suppose thats the nature of being downtown. Probably would save money on that next time. No fan in bathroom so there was some humidity in there. I also requested a 4pm check out but they could only do 1pm. No big deal and wed still stay here again. Great location and lot of food/drink options within walking distance as well. Thank you for taking the time to share your review Lisabonvoyage, we're happy to hear you enjoyed your stay with us and were able to take advantage of our location.
1	Excellent location. We stayed here for the start of Mardi Gras and the location was just perfect. Efficient check-in by staff but had to wait for room as it was not ready. This was no problem for us at all. We had just missed breakfast but tea and coffee was on tap all day at no extra cost which was a nice touch. When our room was ready (we were in the main block) we were pleasantly surprised how roomy it was with king sized bed, fridge, iron and ironing board and good bathroom with bath tub. It overlooked the lovely courtyard and pool area. The hotel didn't do lunch or dinner but staff were very helpful in suggesting a deli for lunch, where you could bring your sandwich back and eat in the breakfast area, and were helpful in suggesting where to eat for dinner. Bourbon Street was only a few blocks away which was very convenient. All in all, very attentive staff, good accommodation, excellent location, lovely courtyard with pool (although it was too cold to use it when we were there). Free wfi with small buriness centre. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.Thank you for choosing The Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel for your stay in New Orleans. We are glad to hear that our hotel met all of your needs. We take pride in making our guests stays comfortable and fun. We look forward to seeing you here at The Landmark very soon.Robert K., Manager on Duty
0	Oddly Paper Thin Walls in Newly Renovated Boutique Hotel. This was the second time I stayed here. The first time everything was fine. This time in room 1509, the neighbors on each side were very loud. The first night on one side I called the front desk and they eventually quieted down. The third night was horrible! We called the front desk 3 times around 11 AM and the people never quieted down. We had to play music to fall asleep. Then at 3:30 AM they were noisy again. When we called again, the new front desk person was not aware of the issue. She offered to move us, but at that point with an early departure, it wasnt worth it. They claimed they sent security, but no results. They said they would refund my room, but in the morning, when I mentioned our problem to the front desk person, she made no mention of it and I had to run to catch a plane.If you are a heavy sleeper, it is a very nice hotel. Small city-size rooms are nicely decorated. Beds are comfortable. They have a nice lobby bar with alcoves where groups can meet. Lucy, the bartender, is very nice and provided excellent service to our group the first time we stayed there. She was very friendly this time as well. From 5-6pm, they offer a free wine happy hour, so the ambiance is nice and lively. No room service, but the lobby bar offers snacks you can bring up to the room. We wanted to schedule our annual company meeting there but although they had well-appointed conference rooms, the catering restrictions were insurmountable. We had a group of 10 people, and they had the perfect room, but wouldnt offer a good value for the forced catering spend. We ended up getting a room at Riva on the Navy Pier, and had a continental breakfast and three course lunch and excellent service vs. a very skimpy offering at Allegro for the same spend. It would have been so much easier to keep it all in the same place, but just not worth it. If you have money to burn on a large expense account, it would probably be a nice place for a conference, as long as your guests are heavy sleepers.If you are traveling and are a heavy sleeper, it is a nice hotel. The thin walls were really puzzling and disappointing.
0	No place to sleep but on the floor. After a long day at Disney we arrived at our hotel around 8:00pm. After checking in and taking out luggage to the room we discovered that the couch pull out bed was completely broken. We had only been in the room about 5 minutes. I went to the desk to ask about changing rooms or having the bed fixed. They would not move us and the bed was ...not repairable. SO, we literally had to remove the mattress from the couch and place it on the floor to sleep. NOT ACCEPTABLE for a Marriott Brand Hotel. The room price was not reduced or any concessions made for our horrible night. I am a Marriott lover, but I may have to consider changing my hotel brand.
1	Nice small hotel with tight parking. It's a nice Best Western hotel with good staff. Rooms are clean and the AC work well. There are a few things that take away a point: the parking is tight even with our family minivan. We got unexpected wake up call from some body car alarm goes off in the middle of the night right outside our room! and one night from the shampoo dispenser in the bath room came off the wall and crashed in the bath tub. It would be nice if they install a room safe and a small refrigerator.Hello FNguyen, Thank you for taking time to review us here on Trip Advisor. We work hard to keep our rooms and property ultra clean and well maintained, our staff consistently offers superior service to all our guests. Thank you for recognizing our efforts! We appreciate your honest remarks. We are so sorry you had a few odd incidents during your stay. Unfortunately, there are some things that we cannot control. Our parking lot can get a little tight, especially during sold out nights. Many guests with larger vehicles choose to park on the street for that reason. The area that we are in is generally a safe business/residential area and fortunately, we have not had any negative reports from people who have chosen to park on the street. We do warn guests that early Tuesday mornings, street sweeping takes place and tickets are given to anyone parked during those hours. As far as the shampoo dispensers go, we have found a solution to this problem and are currently taking care of it so that it does not continue to be an issue. Your two suggestions have been passed on to the GM for consideration. We value our guests input and are always working on improving our little hotel. Again, thank you for sharing your experience with us. We hope to serve you again in the future! * Book Direct with Us - For the Best Service, Selection, and Value! * Yours in Hospitality,Michelle C.

0	Dirty AC-Worn out mattress. Hotel was quiet. Other than the AC that looked like it came out of a crack house and the worn out mattress and elevator it was fair. Does management ever check the rooms I like Hampton Inns yet I cannot stand dirty AC. Come on Hampton. You can do better than this. I checked in late and the staff was... More
0	It's Okay. The good points: it's relatively inexpesive, it was clean, and the service was good. The bad: it's close to a heavily used road (think noise), and its not quaint or luxurious. The brochure claims that you get a complimentary Breakfast. But what they actually give you is 2.50 off your breakfast at Dennys. This basically covered the cost of our coffee. I don't think Dennys has a breakfast on the menu for 2.50.
1	How can you beat a champagne welcome. How can you beat a champagne welcome before going to your quiet, comfy, updated room that is close to great shopping, great restaurants and the theater, not to mention an easy walk to business appointments in the financial district. I'd read other reviews of the hotel, so I requested a room on a low floor in a quiet spot. The wonderful, friendly desk staff were very accommodating and put me on the second floor, which allowed me to take the stairway to the lobby. I was a little concerned about the bed, having read other reviews. No worries, the bed was very comfortable, not too hard at all. The room was updated and appointed well. While I'm sure there are some small rooms in the hotel - after all it is San Francisco - the one I had was a perfect size. The bathroom was tiny - after all it is San Francisco - but remodeled and clean. Across from the theater, two blocks down from Union Square and some of the best shopping in the world, any type of food you can imagine within a few blocks.Thank you very much for sharing this great feedback on your recent stay with us! We are pleased to hear you had a wonderful first impression and enjoyed the bubbly! We strive for great service and are happy you found our staff friendly and helpful. Your review means a lot to us and we hope to welcome you back again soon.
1	Mostly good, like everyone says. Our stay before our flight was as good as everyone states except for one thing. One of the reasons we like Hampton is that we can grab something to eat on our way out. We realize that there would be no real breakfast at 4 am when we left but the night receptionist hinted to at least some muffins in the morning. We were so disappointed to find nothing. Not even the juice machines worked. Oh, we did get our coffee and tea, which were wonderful. We were even able to grab the Sunday paper, which was an unexpected bonus. Just disappointed not to get anything else.Dear PACachers,Thank you for sharing your recent experience with us at our hotel. We truly value your feedback and comments. We are glad you enjoyed your stay with us. We apologize and understand that we did not exceed your expectations regarding breakfast. We appreciate your feedback it helps us to strive for excellence. We hope to serve you on your next trip to Philadelphia. Thank you for making it the Hampton Inn Philadelphia Airport.Thank You!
1	Felt better than Home !!!. I have to first say, I have been staying in just about every Hyatt in the U.S. But the staff at the Hyatt house is hands down the Best !!! I came in for business training. And on the 2nd day my car broke down, after the stress with AAA. Mind you, the hotel staff picked me up, even gave me a ride to pick up my car!! Look I have seen far and beyond going out of the way...but they gave me a peace of mind. And even took the price off the parking!! I mean they didn't have to, it was not their problem. But took the time to help a guest out... On top of that, you can't beat a better view to sleep with than a view of the space needle. Just want to say this is a great place a home from home why I keep coming back !!! Great job gals/guys and thank you! Dear KaylaNGerardW,Thank you for completing a TripAdvisor review regarding your recent stay at our hotel. Please know that your feedback is extremely valuable to us and we will utilize your response to make every guest experience the best it can be. I am glad to hear that you and your enjoyed our staff and felt like home to you! We greatly appreciate your 5 star review it will be celebrated with the hotel. Sorry about your car issues, but I am glad that we would help with that stress. If I can be of any assistance to you, please contact me directly. We very much appreciate your business and hope to see you again hopefully soon! Sincerely,Jonathan

1	Portsmouth weekend. Met a group of guys down in Portsmouth for a weekend of NSW training. Didn't spend a ton of time at the hotel but I was pleased with my stay. The room was very clean. Had a nice comfortable king bed. Plenty of room. Had a couch as well. Breakfast wasn't all that. Had a waffle maker, eggs, sausage, sausage sandwiches, cereal, bagels, toast etc.. the sausage was that microwave junk. ate it the first morning but that was it. I didn't check anything else in the hotel out or have a need to seek service. I would stay there again.

1	Wonderful location in old town. Arrived early rooms wasnt ready, so took a walk around the old town. Very Mexican also very quaint. The hotel its self was very nice, staff help full. Our room was good size with a balcony over looking the pool. Tried the restaurant one night, found the food to be very tasteful. A wonderful waiter whos name I forgot ( sorry ) was very informative about San Diego. Overall a lovely hotel and wound recommended and definitely stay again if ever in San Diego. Thank you for your recent stay at our Best Western. Im happy to hear you took a stroll through Old town while waiting for your room. Did you get a chance to see the Heritage Park or the Whaley (haunted) House next door There is a lot of history here! Ill pass your regards to the team at the Old Town Tequila Factory, our rooftop restaurant. Glad to hear you enjoyed the service there and at the hotel. We strive to offer gracious hospitality and your comments let us know we succeeded. Looking forward to your return and sincerely appreciate the recommendation. Wishing you a colorful autumn season!

1	Beautiful hotel right next to Space Needle/Seattle Center. This is an awesome hotel! The staff was very nice and extremely helpful. The hotel is modern and beautiful. The location is excellent, right across the street from the Space Needle. The roof top terrace is lovely day or night with an amazing view of the Space Needle. Easy to get to downtown via a 2.25 trip (each way) on the Monorail to Westlake Center. From Westlake Center, it's just a 10 minute walk to Pike Place. The hotel also provides shuttle service within a mile.Cheryl H,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor. We are thrilled to hear that you created wonderful memories throughout Seattle and utilized the amenities within our beautiful new hotel. I will pass on your kind words to the staff, they will all be bursting with excitement knowing they made a difference. We are always trying to leave our guests with lasting memorable experiences. Please let us know when you plan on returning to Seattle as we would love to you welcome you as our guest again!Sarah Junge
0	It's so so. The hotel is OK ,the guy on the front desk was very nice ,the rooms are OK BUT in the morning I had a few bed bug bites and there is no continental breakfast just protein bars . On top of that upon check out I ask the lady at the front desk for a receipt and she told me she can't give me one cuz I book the room over the Internet but when I checked in I signed a paper with the amount and just wanted a copy of that page but she refused to give me cuz it was for the hotel use only ... So ridiculous . She wasn't on a mood or something but very rude so if you can find another hotel go there ...
0	Use the in-room safe. The only concern that I had was the cleaning service left our hotel room door open while we were away. When we came back, luckily nothing was missing. I would suggest using the safe the hotel provides at NO additional charge.All in all, I found that for the price the location was great. It is directly across the street from the tram entrance and main gate entrance to the two parks. The best thing I found was the Denny's restaurant located at the entrance to the hotel parking lot.
1	Chicago Traveler - Wedding Visit. We had a nice room - view wasn't the greatest (looking at a parking garage). Hotel location was great - near many things including the Farmers Market. Staff was great! - very helpful. Mykaela helped us along the way answering a bunch of questions and checked us out - remembered us by name! Kyle helped - and booked a tour for us. Cleaning staff had the room immaculate every day. All in all, a great visit!Hello RZ52,Thank you for your feedback. I am happy you enjoyed your stay and service of the hotel. I hope your travels bring you back some time soon!Warmest Regards,Nadia
1	Excellent in every way. I stay at this JW Marriott every time I visit Atlanta, which is several times a year. Whether with my husband or shopping trips with my daughter and granddaughter, I feel special and welcome each time. I cannot say enough about the front desk staff. They see to your every need, greeting you by name each time you walk through the door.They make you feel very much at home! The rooms are amazing, always clean and up to date. I love the concierge lounge- the breakfast and evening horderves are excellent and the staff is so kind. Thank you everyone for making each visit to this Marriott one of a kind!Thank you for sharing your JW Marriott Atlanta Buckhead experience. I am glad we were able to make you feel special during your visit and that you were home-away-from-home. I'll share you wonderful comments with our team. Looking forward to your next visit.
0	Princeton Reunion. The room was pleasant. However, I could have done without the cockroaches in the kitchen area and the bathroom. When you only clean rooms once a week you are going to have bugs!!
1	Excellent place near Old Town. Three of us stayed here before a Baja trip and then came back for 3 more days to be a tourist. Appreciated that they had a shuttle to pick us up within 20 mins from the airport. Using AAA card gave us a free buffet breakfast which was quite good. We first came on a Weds which was a an evening they had free Mexican food and a drink in the lobby which was good enough for our dinner that night. The room was fine and the beds were comfortable. The staff were all pleasant and even the housekeepers like Carmen, gave us warm greetings each day. The views over the city especially at sunset were enjoyable and the patios had pretty plants. Too chilly in Feb to try the pool but it looked nice. We were in the 300 building the first time and the 600 one the 2nd time. The 600 one takes a bit of effort to wind your way to it through 3 or 4 elevators but the rooms were fine. The Tequila restaurant was good for drinks and a snack and also for meals. Only a matter of a minute to walk to the town or to get the hop on hop off bus. A 5 minute walk takes you to the tram where you can then get a bus to the zoo. Not hard to figure out and the locals were also helpful. Greetings, and thank you for your recent stay. Its always a delight to hear about our guests experience. Your description is filled with great tips which will surely be helpful to those planning a visit. Carmen is an asset to our housekeeping team and will receive recognition! We hope your future plans will include a return visit. Please feel free to reach out to me if I can offer any assistance. Until then - we wish you safe travels! Regards,Ryan AguinaldoGeneral Manager

The room I stayed in has terrible ventilation and low quality bed, sheets, towels, etc. I am most peeved by the service and wish I could say I had a better experience.Thank you for taking the time to review your stay. We apologize for any inconvenience you experienced. We welcome all guest comments because they let us know what we are doing well and where we can improve. Thanks again.
1	Cute hotel at perfect location!. My daughter and I have stayed for 5 nights here during our visit to New Orleans. Very cute hotel, modern design, good vibe, friendly staff! We've got a nice corner room at 14th floor, beds were so comfortable and everything is new and clean! Walking distance from French quarter, Bourbon street, Lafayette square, we didn't even use any transportation beside the street car to get to the City Park. Thank you for taking a moment to share your experience. Our guest comments are very important to us, they allow us an opportunity to celebrate our successes while also finding ways we may improve. We look forward to seeing you on your next visit to New Orleans.Thank youWayneGeneral Manager
0	Second chance. I normally travel quite a bit and because of a meeting I was attending I decided to stay at the hotel that was hosting it. This is the second time I've been so disappointed with my room. Everything was so dirty . Sink, shower, hair dryer .... so very disappointing. This was my second time staying in a Wyndham and both times I've been very displeased with my experience.

1	Looks are deceiving. On arrival looked like regular motel that could use upgrading. The bed in the room had stained pillows and the phone did not work. We reported the problem at the front desk and were given a new room which appeared to be newly painted with a wooded floor (very nice). We were on the second floor (recommended) as lot of street noise and parking lot. Only problem with second floor lots of stairs. The employees were very helpful and friendly.The location is a bus stop away from seaworld and there are fast food and restaurants within walking distance. Uper and lyft available also taxi. I would stay again if in area.Long walk to storesJames, We always appreciate the chance to make our guests feel more comfortable during their stay thus, we thank you for notifying our front desk of the issues you encountered in your first room. We are delighted to know we were able to improve your stay with our helpful and friendly service. It is exciting to hear we may receive the privilege of hosting you again. Once again, thank you for your kind compliments! During any future stays, we hope you will always let us know if there is anything we can do to ensure you have the best stay possible.
0	Grossest and scariest place I've stayed in.. Here on business and there are limited choices, so I decided to try this because of the ratings. I arrived and checked in and my door was unlocked. Fingerprints, stains and hairs. This is surface cleaning, so the thought of what hasn't been deep cleaned in a while is scary.
1	It was OK.. This is hard to do because the owners are really nice, but I have to be honest. There is a smell that seems to be in every Days Inn I've ever stayed in. Like..the rooms have a TASTE to them that isnt pleasant. I'm not talking about smoking rooms. My room was non-smoking, and it had that taste. I think it may be a product/room freshener or something that lingers. The furniture had sticky spots even after the room was cleaned, and I think its from that product. The smell gets all in your clothes, cigarettes..not good. Would I stay again Maybe. The pool was fun. The Asst Manager came to help me with an appliance issue, and while he did some things, he was supposed to come back and he never did. The pool was fun. There are all kinds of shopping and food around there. Wal-Mart/Golden Corral around the corner, good food right next door (mostly fried food though). Would I stay there again Maybe..but only AFTER seeing/smelling my room first.
0	Uncaring or Incompetent Staff. I gave this hotel a 2 ONLY because it was clean and the room was comfortable. Otherwise it would have been a 1.

1	Great stay for a quick business trip!. We stayed at the Aloft for a business trip. It was super convenient having this hotel right next door to convention center! Staff nice, rooms clean, beds were comfy and spacious, great bar and outdoor space to relax! Ill stay here again if I have to come back for work. Train station a little over two miles away. I submitted a survey the first night there asking for an orange pen (they have the best) and the next day before lunch there was a bag hanging on my door with four pens in it. Talk about paying attention to detail. What a great customer experience. Hi Sarah, FIVE BUBBLES!!! We love it, thank you!! Glad you got some time to chill in our Backyard, it's the perfect place to hang after a day of work. If the 4 pens run out, you know where to get more :) Come back just for fun, we are not only about serving you for work. Perhaps you can PEN a best seller...Happy Summer, Evan
1	Phoenix February. I stayed for 3 days business of an 8 day business trip to North America. A welcome and refreshing change from typical chain hotels. Great rooms but limited storage space to really unpack. Food was great but the music never matched the ambience or ethic menu. The art was great in the lobby. It's in a great location for walking to local bars and cafes. A had some minor issues but this were promptly resolved with great service.Glad to hear you had a great stay. We hope you will return again soon. Thanks for taking the time to write this review.

1	Beautiful Hotel, Top Notch Customer Service. Our room was huge, which was not what I was expecting in the first place. The staff was INCREDIBLE accommodating and so unbelievably nice. I needed help storing a cake for a wedding I was in town for, and without question they helped me bring it down to the kitchen's fridge, and then back up again when I needed it. They were SO nice! The view was great as well. Can't say enough good things.Hi Caitlin! Thank you very much for taking the time to write this review. We love to see that you had a five-star experience! We are truly fortunate to have such a friendly staff who are eager to help with whatever you need. Come back and see us soon!
0	Bad room if you are in a wheelchair. The handicapped room was not in compliance with ADA and we will not stay there again. There is no excuse for this type of room that is completely inadequate, since ADA was passed over twenty years ago.MoreDear Tom, We are so sorry to hear that we did not exceed your expectations, that is never our intention. We do hope that you choose to stay with us again in the future. Perhaps we can prepare a different room for you that is...More
0	Less than perfect. Beware there is limited space for have breakfast in the morning, so get there early. Watch where you park, some guest may have just walked their dog. Hope the people above you know how to be respectful of those below, elephants above make a lot of noise. If you happen to visit on a day that may involve children you may want to pick another hotel, we could hear virtually everything going on around us. We have stayed at Hampton's before and this is why we have stopped visiting. We try to visit Homewood's as their rooms are almost sound proof. We once stayed in a Homewood with a family of seven next door (children teenagers) and we never knew there was anyone even next door. At this property, we could hear the parents, next door, telling their kids to go to sleep, as if it was on the tv we were watching.I sincerely apologize for the noise you encountered from other guests during your stay. Our guests comfort and safety is my number one concern and I apologize that your comfort was interrupted. Your review will assist in correcting issues in the future. I do hope that the next time you are in the area you will consider staying at our property again. Thank you.Kind Regards,Hotel Management
0	Nice owner BUT rooms deteriorated. I did not want to write a review when we first stayed as the owner told us he had just lost his wife. We stayed one night because of that..however the room was very, very shabby. The outside door offered little to no security...perhaps a closet door. The room was dingy and small. The kitchen had a tiny fridge w/half... More
1	Exceptional Breakfast. I can't comment on cost because I used points but the morning breakfast was awesome. It was buffet style with made to order eggs. There were multiple waiters taking care of all our needs. The room was great and the customer service from the front desk was excellent. The location is very close to the airport. The only negative experience was the 15 minute wait for the shuttle.Dear JohnTSanAntone,Thank you so much for the five-star review and for taking the time to tell us that we succeeded in providing you with a comfortable stay. I am so glad our accommodations, facilities and terrific location were all a big hit, and that the breakfast we offered you added more value to your stay. We want you to have a memorable experience in every regard. Thank you again for staying with us we would love for you to come back and see us again soon!All the Best,Melissa PetiotAssistant General ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport
0	Ugh!. I generally use lowest cost accommodations, so often use Motel 6. They tend to range from OK to a great deal. This one is absolutely the WORST one I have ever used. I had the impression that it is about to fall apart and someone is milking the last few dollars from a decaying structure. When I walked down the... More
0	Go elsewhere for your NOLA stay!. Toilet paper is like sandpaper. Billed for charges that even the staff can not explain and having to make numerous repeat calls to get corrected. A week later and STILL not corrected. If you stay, get your bill before you leave the property! Coffee was offered in lobby first day and then STOPPED Seems as if the restaurant is struggling and they wanted people to purchase coffee vs offer. Pitiful. One of the worst hotel stays I have had, especially from a Hilton. Location is not the best eitherThank you for taking the time to share this feedback and we apologize for any issues you encountered during your stay. Your feedback is very important to us and so please contact me directly to discuss further so that I can address accordingly.Regards,
1	Nice place, but breakfast is so-so.. I like this place, even though it is a 30-minute commute to my work location, but the shuttle to Metro is convenient. This time one of the elevators was out of service with a note that it would be fixed the Monday of my arrival, but it was still out of commission when I left. The only drawback is the breakfast. One day, they added some sausage patties to the steamer table and it was actually cold--not even room temperature. It should have been heated first, because it appeared to be leftover from another day (and not just 1 day ago because the day before they had links, not patties). The last day, there wasn't even really meat. They had eggs, potatoes and grits along with corned beef hash, which is more of a potato entree--not a meat entree. For someone like myself, who doesn't eat potatoes, there was essentially no meat. Hopefully in the future, there will be plain meat--either bacon or sausage. I would not hesitate to come back here in the future.
0	Would not recommend this place. No greeting at checking had to wait 15 min for someone to come out of the back room. Other times in the week no staff at front desk. Room smelled like mildew due to AC that had been leaking for a while. TV sound went out mid week and never came back and was never offered another room. Very poor customer service and isn't worth the money.
0	Terrible customer service.. Terrible. I spent my last penny reserving my room and i didn't see anything about a deposit under the small print tab, so I thought I was all paid up. Suddenly, after having spent nearly half an hour checking-in with their highly unprofessional staff just before I was given my keys so I could go find my room, the room keys didn't work on my room. So I walked all the way to the lobby, this time with my bags in tow, only to find out that they deactivated my room keys because they weren't able to charge card for incidentals. Which is when I said, of course not...I spent my last penny reserving this place online and there was no mention of a deposit in your 'small print' tab online. Every room I've reserved through Hotels.com, that has charged me a deposit, mentioned a deposit or incidentals charge in their small tab. Well I cancelled my reservation and asked for my money back so I could rent another room elsewhere. The manager cancelled my reservation and stated that he would be refunding my money, but he never did. I was not able to rent another room...I was broke.
0	Rudest Staff I Have Ever Encountered. The lady that works the front desk (who to this day will not tell me her name) was extremely rude to me in regard to my simple request for some water. You can get it our of the sink like everyone else. was her reply to my request Although I couldn't find water suitable for drinking, there was no lack... More
1	All you'll need. Spent 3 nights at the Vertigo and can't really find anything to complain about check in was quick easy and friendly, our room on floor 7 was clean, big enough for us and fairly quiet other than an italian couple who deemed it acceptable at 7am to laugh and chat at the top of their voices! Walls are quite thin Used gym which was good for a hotel this size decent coffee in room and downstairs, good location for union sq and other neighbourhoods all In all a pleasant stayDear DJH1973,Thank you so much for your 5 star review - I am happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us and that you did not let the loud couple affect your wonderful stay at the Hotel Vertigo. We look forward to having you again as our guest!Warm regards,Jaime GonzalezFront Office ManagerHotel Vertigo
1	A Comfortable Stay. The Hotel Allegro is an older hotel that has been renovated in the heart of the Chicago Loop. The location is ideal for theater goers and has easy access to public transport and cabs. The rooms are very well decorated and very clean, and the bed was wonderful. The Atelier Bloom amenities are nice, and the cheetah bathrobe is a fun touch. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is for the very small rooms and slow elevators, both likely as a result of it being a historic property. If you are traveling solo or are a close couple without a lot of luggage you should be ok, otherwise you should probably consider a roomier option.Hi there jpinedo! Thanks for taking the time to enhance our online reputation! Wonderful to hear you enjoyed your stay with us and took the cheetah robe for a spin. Good news, our Atelier Bloem products will soon be available on our KimptonStyle.com website for purchase, so you can have a little piece of Kimpton with you all the time! Should a return visit be in the future, feel free to reach out to me directly and we see about upgrading you into one of our larger rooms! Amber BertschGuest Experience Manager

1	lovely b and b with victorian charm in big city!. This boutique hotel-bed and breakfast is so charming and the decor is beautiful.The lobby is lovely with a big gorgeous chandelier and velvet chairs.I've stayed there 2 times now and both rooms were beautifully decorated with victorian touches that I loved!There was free coffee and tea in the lobby and breakfast in the morning.The Italian restaurant located right off the lobby is cozy and delicious too.Lorenzo was so nice and took great care of my guitar that I left,on one of my visits.They have small rooms and big rooms and 2 room suites.The only drawback for me,I wish it were a little closer to Union Square, but still not a bad walk, and lots of other shopping and food in the neighborhood.
1	Faultless !. Hubby and I spent 4 days here in June at the end of a 4 week road trip around California. It was just what we needed - a massive, clean , comfortable room, great bed , helpful staff and convenient location. We asked for a room at the back and it was perfectly quiet, which is one thing I was worried about . The desk staff were great, very knowledgeable, patient and kind. Oscar did our on-line flight check-in for us , even though it took him ages to get onto the website. He and all the staff were so friendly and helpful and nothing was any trouble at all. The bus stop was right outside, cable car- stop just one street over and a great Indian restaurant over the road , so everything really convenient. The decision to stay here wasn't taken lightly, as I had read so many reviews for hotels in San Franciso, so we were really pleased at how great it was. I'd have no doubts about staying here next time we are in SF !
0	Wouldn't recommend staying here. I am in complete agreement with the review from SEH7 about this hotel. They really need to decide if they are a hotel or a night club. The staff was very friendly and helpful. But my one additional complaint would be how bad our bathroom was. The bathtub was peeling and dirty and the mold on the shower curtain was horrible.
1	Engagement Trip. This perfect hotel is in the perfect location. The photos here don't do it justice. If you like trendy boutique hotels, then this is the perfect place for you to stay in Key West. We loved everything about our stay. The room and property were well kept and clean, the breakfast was plentiful and met our needs, and the staff were all very friendly. I would recommend this hotel for couples or a getaway with friends.Thank You, and a special thanks from the staff of The Saint Hotel Key West. We are extremely thankful for your recommendations and your excellent praise of the property. We hope we have the opportunity to accommodate you on your next trip to Key West.
1	Upgrades Every Time!. When we checked in for our 2nd stay, we were surprised to see the room was much smaller than last time, as we were upgraded to a suite then. When we went downstairs to ask about the upgrade we saw online, they kindly accommodated us upgraded us to an even bigger room, no problem. The staff is extremely nice the complimentary drinks from 5-7 are a nice touch! I just wish they had a fridge int he room.Thank you for being a loyal guest of our hotel! We are happy to hear you find our staff members extremely nice. We look forward to seeing you next time you are in SF. Thanks again.
1	Pretty nice hotel overall.. Hotel is right off of the main highway into VA Beach, so it's very quick to get in and out. It is right by the boardwalk as well, within walking distance of the pier. So overall, I love the location! The room is small and divided into two section--living area (with pull out couch or another queen bed depending on room selection), and bedroom. I did not like the bedroom being by the hallway, the wall isn't thin but you can still hear people at night. The bathroom is nicely renovated recently, which was a big plus. Wife and kids loved the balcony facing the ocean, we enjoyed watching the beach at dusk. Overall, we had a very pleasant 3 nights stay at this Comfort Inn and will definitely book it for next year's trip back to VA Beach.
1	So relaxing!. The service is superb, the little extras, like the wine reception, appreciated, the property well kept and pretty, the location is fantastic, and best of all, we got a chance to really, truly relax! We chose the master suite, which had a private patio, large bedroom and doors that could close off the living area. This was essential because we had our 18 month old with us and it was so nice to be able to put him to bed and still be able to stay up and enjoy a bottle of wine, a movie, and grab drinks from the pool bar and hang on our patio. It was almost like we were on an actual date. The pool was lovely, and yes, the whole family was there, including the dog. The front desk staff was won over by his scruffy ways and kept giving him treats. He was in heaven - especially when we took him to Ocean Dog Beach, just a short drive away. We love Kimptons! I just wish the rooms with separate living area weren't sooooo much more . It's worth it when you have a little one - otherwise we'd have to tiptoe around in the dark for fear of waking him up or go to bed at 8pm - but it's harder on a family budget to spend that much extra on the room. Still...we had a fantastic time!
1	A lovely downtown hotel. We stayed in this hotel for a week. The staff was great, room had lots of great amenities, walking distance to Capitol Hill, pikes market, the space needle, and a shopping malls. Also, great views of the city. I will definitely stay here again on my next Seattle visit. Thank you for the amazing review! We love that our central downtown location allows our guests to easily shop and explore all the great spots that Seattle has to offer. We pride ourselves on providing the best customer service and we are pleased to hear that you encountered this during your stay! We look forward to having you back with us on your next visit to Seattle.Brenna N.Guest Relations Manager
1	good place to stay near French quarter. No need to infuse the air with that small/fragrance. Your other guests may like it, but I prefer natural air and so held my breath between the front door and the elevator.The room keepers can also be more gentle with closing the doors during their morning rounds, so as not to wake other rooms' occupants.Other than the above points, a good place to stay near French quarter.Truly thankful you enjoyed your stay and while we love the fresh air ourselves, that signature scent can be found around the world at all Aloft hotels. We appreciate the feedback regarding our housekeeping staff and will be sure to share with the department leader to help rectify that problem.Thank you again for your business and hope you'll be back soon,Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager
1	Great Hotel Chain, But Service Lags Behind. Embassy Suites as a chain is great. Who else offers the manager special and great breakfast buffet that, to us, is the hallmark of their hotel. However, I was disappointed with the service in Linthicum, MD during our stay. I did not feel the front desk was friendly or had smiles. I hate dealing with customer service that you feel you are inconveniencing. If you have kids that stay with you on the fold-out couch, they never have extra bedding in the room, if you want to make up the bed. We asked the front desk for the extra bedding. It wasn't provided. We called housekeeping. No answer. We called the desk, and eventually housekeeping brought up extra towels. Eventually, housekeeping brought up some bedding with a repeat call to the desk. The next morning their was no receipt on the floor by your door like most hotels. Because we didn't just wanted to go in the morning, after our yummy breakfast (during which mindful busboys kept our table clear of extra, now emptied dishes), we just wanted to pack up and leave without stopping by the desk. This was probably a big mistake, because I found out the next weekend, that the Linthicum charged us for the room on top of what I already paid hotels.com. That was incredibly annoying. What if never had checked my account. Could this have happened at another time, at one of their other locations Thankfully, a call to the polite desk supervisor took care of it for us. We're supposed to get a credit in a few days.
1	Had a nice stay. This older hotel is in a great location, close to shopping, beaches, and other attractions. Lots of places to eat nearby. The hotel staff were friendly and very responsive and we loved the free parking! The rooms have been recently remodeled and were clean and spacious. Recommend the hotel purchase and install blackout curtains for the rooms to block outside lights that shine into the rooms. Also, there are no elevators to the second floor rooms. We would definitely stay at this hotel again.It is wonderful to hear you enjoyed your recent stay with us here at Ramada Limited San Diego! We are glad you found our accommodations to be clean, comfortable and ideally located in the city. Our staff is always available to help and is dedicated to ensuring our guests' needs are met. We appreciate your high regard and compliments! Thank you for the suggestion on the blackout curtains. We will keep this in mind during future updates. It would be a pleasure to see you again during any future visits to the area!
1	Decent Rooms at a Decent Price. We stayed here because we needed a room that would sleep 6 people at a decent price. Upon arrival, the front desk staff were friendly...even though they tried to charge my card twice. They were always willing to help whenever the need arose though. The housekeeping staff were quite the contrary. If you needed anything outside the ordinary, they seemed bothered or afraid they were going to get in trouble from management. The room was dated but was comfortable. All ammenities worked as advertised and the room was similar to the pictures. The restaurant (Tradewinds) provided above average food at an affordable price. The pool was large enough for a large number of people but wasn't cleaned during our stay. (4 Days) It was open 24 hours though, which was nice as we arrived late the first night and did activities during the day/evening. Being off of the boardwalk provided a quiet experience which was nice. Also, there is a Food Lion directly across the street which we used to stock our cabinets and refrigerator. The beach was clean and also had a lit volleyball court after dark. My overall experience is as title states.
0	HORRIBLE!. We checked into the Hotel and paid over 439 for a room. We got to our room and I literally got locked into the bathroom. The maintenance man had to come get me out. There was no knob on the door! The room also faced...More
1	Very Nice, Close to lots. Very nice hotel in a pretty good neighborhood. Close to trolley stop. Easy walking distance to riverfront, a little farther to Bourbon St. We were pretty low when we stayed and one night was VERY noisy outside. Ask for a higher room. The staff was very pleasant and competent and the facility was very clean. The breakfast buffet was pretty good (considering the price) and the dining room was 4x bigger than you would typically see in a free breakfast area. The afternoon Happy Hour was always fun. We saw a lot of New Orleans from there, with the exception of the Garden District. Very good stay and I would go back there on my next visit to NOLA. The rates were fairly good, but the parking seemed excessive.
1	Flexible and prepared. Joy! She was there whenever we needed anything and she was so flexible and understanding. She made great suggestions and understood what we needed before we did. That is kind of how the whole hotel worked. Everything was stocked, clean and worked well. You could ask any staff member for something and they made it happen. Breakfast was stocked and the staff members there were quick to clean and help out. I was really blown away by everyone's attitude. No one seemed to be tired of dealing with guests like you see at other hotels. Carlos checked us out and he showed us the same amount of flexibility and the didn't overcharge for things they could have. Also, it's a great location, close to anything you'd need.We are delighted to have been your chosen hotel during your recent stay in Anaheim.

1	It COULD be a 5, but.... My husband and I, along with my bestie and her husband stayed at Hotel Nikko for a quick jaunt down to SF from Seattle. We enjoyed our stay, but there were a couple of things... 1. The rooms are MUCH smaller than you think they are going to be and (I know it's weird to mention this, but) the self cleaning toilet was loud and random. 2 The lounge which looks ah-mazing online LOOKS ah-mazing in person, but the hours are inconsistent. Okay, now for the pluses: The check in process and people at the front desk were wonderful! Not to mention the concierge, with whom we steadily checked in, were (there were multiples) VERY helpful. Overall, my husband said he would definitely stay here again, but I'm not 100 sure.Hi Sheryl B,What a great review. We always appreciate specific comments like the ones you left for us, and we have taken note! I'm so glad you found our front desk and concierge staff to be helpful, and enjoyed the hotel over all. Please let me know when you're headed to San Francisco again-- we would love the chance to impress you!Warmest regards,Danielle Ortega, Assistant Marketing Manager415-394-1175
1	Return Visit. We came back after a bad experience last year as the manager offered us a discount to try it out again. Overall the staff were friendly except for when we checked in. We went to the lounge after check in and waited over 15 minutes before being acknowledged (while sitting at the bar), and then another 10 minutes before we received a drink. I really wanted to eat there as the food looked amazing last year, but we chose to dine somewhere else. Our hotel room was beside a meeting room that was booked both mornings of our stay so we were woken up at 6:45am both days. Their food beverages were set up outside our window so it was loud and we were not able to sleep in. The hotel itself is beautiful and the hot tub pool area is a lot of fun. The rooms are a bit difficult to locate as there are multiple buildings and levels.

0	Total Disgrace..stay in a motel... So The Chelsea is running an excellent ruse...you walk in to the lobby, which is sleek, shiny, modern and fab. You are checked in by excellent staff and then you are directed to the Annex..The Annex is an horrible shabby motel, decor is straight out of the 70's, the room was slightly grubby and the bathroom made me shudder. The drawers on the unit in the bedroom kept sliding open and hitting you if you happened to be passing. The door to our room had a 2inch gap, so you got cold air in the room and every single sound from the corridor.They do not advertise the Annex the way it should be advertised, they make out it is the same as the rest of the Chelsea. The exorbitant New Year's Eve rate is a disgrace for that room - I would have gone to the Motel across the street, had I realised I would be staying in a motel anyway

1	Great value and location. My first time staying at a Best Western Plus and I was pleasantly surprised. The employees here are great and genuinely nice people always willing to assist. The rooms were clean and well kept and nicely appointed. The bed was comfortable and the bathrooms spacious and clean. It was also very convenient to have a Denny's restaurant within the hotel. The location of this hotel is also very good and on a main road with many shops and dining options. This place is good for an affordable family trip without sacrificing on quality.Jorge,Thank you for the great review. We are always looking at being very competitively price and to give our guest the best accommodations for the price in Napa. We will see you on your next trip to Napa.
0	they charged my card. So I will say I'am not a big fan of Hilton however my front office Manager gave me gift certificate to this property and everything was fine the room was beautiful and had a great time until a month later I found out a room that was a free night stay got charged 183.65 and instead of trying to correct the issue right away I have to wait till they track down an employee to verify that I gave my gift card to her what I dont get is Hampton is is suppose to give you a free refund if you are unhappy with your stay well you guys charged me for a stay and I was not suppose to be charged and your making it hard for me to get my refund so I dont know how true the if your not satisfieded statment is I am waiting to see if I am reimbiursed before I say I will never stay at another Hilton branded property also I called for towels since there was only 2 in my room and had to go to the front desk to get them myself the guy that answered must have never relayed the messageThank you for taking the time to tell us about your recent experience at our hotel.

0	Not up to normal HGI standards. The good -- the hotel was nice, relatively new and had an indoor drop off lane, so getting in during inclement weather would be easy. The room was normal sized for this type of hotel, but typical HGI spartan, no in room safe, just basic furnishing. The ceilings were high, which gave the room a roomier feel for the size. The bad - we had a power outage for a few hours during the night, the whole neighborhood, not HGI's fault, but there are no emergency lights in the room, so if you didn't have phone or flashlight nearby, it was very dark (room darkening shades work well). The front door of the hotel is locked 24/7, making me wonder about the neighborhood. Our keys were either improperly programmed or were deprogrammed somehow and it took 2 trips to get them reprogrammed, the first one didn't work, and of course it happened when friends were waiting for us. The housekeeping staff tried to barge in our room at 8 a.m., check out was at noon and after getting up for an hour for the power outage, we were trying to sleep in. Then they went to the next room and banged the vacuum against the wall and adjoining room door waking us again. When I brought these issues with the desk on checkout, I was offered a bottle of water for my trouble, a less than satisfactory response. If the customer service was a bit better, it might have increased the rating.Hi Tom. Thank you very much for your feedback. While we're very glad to hear there were some aspects of your stay that went well, we deeply apologize for the other instances you mentioned. We're especially sorry to hear that you left with a less than satisfactory response from our front desk. We strive to ensure all of our guests leave happy and satisfied with their stay and we apologize that you did not. We have reviewed this with our team and can assure you this is not typical of our property. We hope you'll give us another opportunity to showcase our property next time you find yourself in Atlanta. Thank you again for bringing these items to our attention.
1	great for conference. Very nice location. At the Grand Hyatt for a conference. Rooms great. Conference rooms great. Food for conference excellent, extremely fresh (nice crisp vegetables). All the natural finishes are lovely - fossils in the bathrooms. About as relaxing as a conference hotel can get.Thank you for the review on your stay at the Grand Hyatt Seattle. We loved the feedback on the facility and food during your conference! I am glad you were comfortable during your stay, and we would be happy to welcome your conference back to our hotel in the future. Lindye W. Guest Relations Manager
0	DO NOT stay in this disgusting hotel. I stayed here with my mother and niece. Upon arrival, I found a USED CONDOM on the floor. I went to the front desk who told me they were sorry in a non apologetic tone, but did not offer me a new room nor to come pick it up or any money off my hotel room. The room was dirty, the bed was very uncomfortable. In the morning when I went to check out I waited for the woman to get off the phone before a rude man busted in front of me and asked to be checked out. The woman at the front desk did not tell him I was next in line and she SERVED him FIRST despite me waiting there. I will never go back here nor will I reccomend it. It's disgusting.
0	No consideration for the customer. I was told at check in there is a 7.00 per day charge for your vehicle for parking. I did not mind this but it is not explained to you on the information of the hotel when booking. The real problem I had was that I had absolutely no hot water to shower with in the morning when I was getting ready for work. I called the front desk and received NO consideration at all. I am a vietnam veteran and I swore I would never take another cold shower so I had to go to work without bathing. NOT FUN!!!!!!!!!!! I paid for breakfast when I reserved the room but I did not receive any coupon at check in and was not told I needed one. After getting dressed, I went to the breakfast area but was not allowed in because I did not have a coupon. I WAS SO UPSET AT THIS POINT THAT I JUST CHECKED OUT AND LEFT. I expressed my feelings to the front desk and they said they could not do anything for me because no one from mainteanace was at work yet. This all happened between 5:45 AM and 6:30 AM
1	Newly renovated,spacious and clean motel. Great host. Good security measure. Have elevator. Clean and newly renovated room. Cheap motel in the city. Near to bus stop heading to fishermen's wharf. Walk-able distant to City hall and other attractions.Wifi may not work during peak hours ie 7pm-12am but very smooth in early morning or midnight. No aircon, so you have to open the window for fresh air. Some noise from gangs and traffic maybe heard but it didnt greatly affect our sleeping quality.If you are going to the motel from Civic center Bart station, try to avoid Hyde,Larkin and Polk street and use Van Ness Ave to avoid homeless and the smell of pee.
1	Overall an enjoyable stay. We enjoyed our stay at this establishment. The king size room was very comfortable, the bedding and mattress type in particular. One aspect of the room that I thoroughly appreciated was the ability to control the climate. In many hotels the thermostats are locked out at a certain temperature depending upon the time of the year. At this hotel you could control the cool air or heat at your discretion (major kudos...). Unfortunately a complaint was lodged with housekeeping because a specific request was made to have the sheets changed (on second day of 3 night stay), and although the request was eagerly granted, the bed linen was not changed. Upon a late return to the hotel we made another request to have the bed linen changed. The service desk accommodated us as best as they could (at 1130p) but our sheets did not get changed until 1245a when the overnight attendant came on duty. This all could have been avoided had the housekeeping receptionist paid actual attention to my request instead of merely giving me lip service. The hotel manager took excellent steps in addressing my concerns. I would definitely stay at this hotel upon future travel. Thank You!
0	How can you rent a room without a working shower?. Shower was broken. People upstairs paced for at least two hours from 2 to 4 AM.
1	Hilton Garden Inn Hampton Colliseum. Great hotel, excellent service from staff including front desk and the restaurant. Breakfast was a fair price and had many options. Food was excellent. Wait staff paid excellent attention to customers. Knew what they wanted for refills and such. And as I'm diabetic, I loved that they had sugar free stuff available. That impressed me a lot. What also impressed me a lot was the option of fruit as a substitute for fries with dinner. Never had that before. Front desk staff were very attentive and helpful. It was near enough to the colliseum, but the hotel and the colliseum are in a kinda tricky area to get in and out of. Nice area, just tricky to navigate. Would recommend to others and would definitely come back again. Rooms were comfy and beds were comfy too. Only complaint with room was very noisy air conditioner or fan or something in the room. All in all great hotel for a great price.

Water was leaking under the sink, bathroom door was kicked in, mold coming out from behind the shower stall, toilet wouldn't flush and, curtains torn off of the curtain rods.

0	Did not like. We did not like this hotel. We left after one night. It was January in DC, (cold) and the heater did not work in the room. We called the person at the front desk but there was no one available to help with this. We called the front desk again for extra blankets which they did bring. We had booked a room with two beds and were very specific about this when calling for the reservation. When we got to the hotel there was only one bed in the room and no one could help us as the front desk was closed, only someone there to had out keys for late arrivals.
0	Trip advisor let me down!. The place is run down and old the only thing it has going for it is the balcony off the room but even that isn't anything special. They say the bathrooms are updated! Certainly not by my standards! I am extremely disappointed and wish we could leave now, I would consider this place dumpy the bar area smells and is... More
1	Nice Off the Strip Hotel. We have stayed at this hotel many times. I think it's great for families. My son loves the small arcade, bowling alley, movie theatre, pool and Friday's restaurant. I love the fact that the rooms are large, very clean and come with a small fridge. It is also great for families to have the shower and toilet area seperate. In addition to Friday's restaurant there are other restaurants including a 24 hour cafe and an ice cream shop that stays open late as well, very convenient. There are also shopping centers near the hotel that include just about every store and restaurant you can think of, Target, PF Changs, Mimi's etc. My parents had an odd numbered room and it overlooked the pool and golf course. My even numbered room overlooked a roof, not so nice. This is really the only negative I can think of. Also, pool area has no lifeguard or supervision of any kind, so some adults got a little unruly, drinking beer in the pool, speaking loudly etc. But, overall this is a nice place to stay off the strip, especially for those traveling to Las Vegas with children.
0	Unsanitary, wet carpet and moldy smell. Had to book a hotel in my city due to moving into a new property. The room looked nice at first glance, but in minutes the smell of damp and smoke bothered me, the carpet was wet, and the cleanliness of the bathroom and surfaces...MoreOh gosh Kimberly G! This is obviously not the typical condition of a room or service we provide. I am so disappointed that this was your experience and I'd be grateful for the opportunity to discuss further. Please reach out to me at your earliest...More
0	Solid budget option. Room was not ready on time, but perfectly fine for the cost
1	Great location. Right on the doorstep of Chinatown, good walk to the wharf area. Very easy to stop outside and drop bags off. We got rid of our car otherwise parking is 55 per night so beware if you are driving here. All staff were brilliant, room was clean and ready to go. Fitness room just about served its purpose, but only 3 machines, could be a problem at rush hour. We're happy you had such a nice stay with us, Ikorel! It sounds like you enjoyed everything from our rooms to our staff. Stop back in again soon. We'd love to have you.Best,Pablo B. General Manager
1	Convenient and Close to 64. We only stayed one night, but we can see why it would be good for an extended stay. The room had a small kitchen and work area. We prefer to stay at hotels that offer a full breakfast, which this one didn't but that was okay, we just went to the Waffle House down the street. This is not a complaint by the way. We were mainly looking for a hotel close to Interstate 64 for one night and the lack of a full breakfast was not a big deal to us. The staff were friendly and courteous and the room was clean and adequate for our needs. We would stay here again if we are ever in the area.
0	room and staff need help. the staff need to be better to that stay there and need to go out of there way to help you and they dont. air filter was very dirty and bed was just ok pool was very cold and it was very hot out and they where cleaning it when we got there so we had to get in a... More
0	Terrible hotel, small chance of getting stabbed.. The worst hotel stay I've ever had. On the positive side there was a hiphop chicken and fish next door...
1	Worth the money and would stay again. My husband and I stayed six nights of their deluxe double room. This hotel was super convenient. Turn right within five minutes walk is the cable car and all the famous U.S. department stores, like Bloomingdale and Norstrom which are inside the big Westfield shopping mall, Walgreen, the supermarket is just in the neighbouhood. There is a Chinese restaurant and a Sushi place just cross the road. I love the bed in Hotel Abri, there were four medium size pillows on it and the bed was very comfortable. The room was very small but everything was in it, also the bathroom was very small, too. The air-condiitioning was the old-fashioned window ones, very noisy. It depends on what you are looking for, for location, this should be a good choice, everything is within walking distance and there is no need to rent a car because parking is very expensive in downtown San Francisco, valet parking in this hotel cost you US50 a day!The elevator was a bit scary, recommended to hold 4 persons! I saw some people choose to use the stairs. All the staffs were very friendly. There was free Wifi but it also depends what time, at night it is super-slow. My room was very quiet because I read the comments before booking this hotel, make sure you ask for the interior room and higher floors. There was a funny smell in the hallway but not inside the room. All in all, I think this hotel worth the money and if I want to stay in San Francisco downtown, I would surely book Hotel Abri again.
0	Disappointing. I always rely on TA before booking a hotel but I didn't on this hotel - that was a huge mistake.The location of the hotel was convenient to all locations we wanted to visit but the place needs to be torn down and rebuilt. It is old, dingy, and dark. The room was very dated and had a very dark appearance although there was a front window. The outside walkway, as mentioned by another traveler, is slanted and uneven. The elevator is scary. The breakfast room looks like it used to be a sleeping room and is very dated and dark. The food is typical continental breakfast food. Overall, I would say spend more money and stay somewhere else.Good Morning,Thank you for sharing your review regarding your recent stay here at the Best Western Mission Bay. On behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. I sincerely appreciate your compliments to our location, just within minutes to most attractions here in San Diego. I apologize for the outside look of our property. Unfortunately, the property next door to ours was just demolished, giving our area a run-down look. We are anticipating construction for the new businesses there within the next year hopefully this will improve the feel of our property.I hope you will consider staying with us again so that we can have another chance to provide you with a superior experience. Please feel free to contact me directly for your reservation needs. You can reach me at 619-275-5700 ext 393 or Lpradohotelpros.biz.Thank you again for your review.Leidy PradoFront Office Manager
0	The absolute worst experience in over 24 years of life on the road.. Unfortunately, I had the displeasure of staying here for almost 3 months while completing a business assignment.

1	River Hotel Review. The location is amazing... right on the river and within walking distance to tons of shops and restaurants. I had a great view of the river from the room!Having the water bottle filling stations was a great benefit. The staff were all friendly and helpful. The self checkout was a breeze!Hello Kathleen C,We are happy to hear our location suited you well during your trip. We are lucky to be located right in middle of the city close to everything. We pride ourselves on service and happy to hear we met our goal during your stay. We look forward to seeing you next time in town.
1	Best Western Plus Inn at the Vines - Comfortable Stay. Hotels can be pricey in Napa especially at peak times. I was coming to BottleRock, America 's newest music festival and didn't want to drive home nightly. I booked this motel right away because I knew there would be a big demand for local accommodations. The Best Western is located at the edge of town. It is a healthy walk to town. For BottleRock a shuttle picked up guests right out front and carried them back after the show. The hotel rooms are clean and spacious with the amenities you would need, including a small refrigerator and microwave. The hotel has a pool and a Denny's is hooked to the building. The hotel gave out a coupon for breakfast at Denny's. The desk staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful. This is a decent place to stay. Prices fluctuate so you have to check aroundThank you for your review and hope to see you before next years Bottle Rock!
1	Good value, pleasant experience.. Hotel rooms in Seattle in the summer are beginning to rival San Francisco in price, so I was pleased to find a Living Social promotion for this place that extended into May. I was pleasantly surprised to find that many of the criticisms about this place by other travelers were exaggerated. We chose a private bath (because I just dont like sharing a bath), but the shared bath facilities looked quite nice and never apparently completely full. We were on the second floor overlooking Ballard Ave., and the weather was relatively warm, but the room cooled off quite well without air-conditioning and the noise level, even on a Saturday night with windows open, was not a problem. Local bars apparently dont have live music and the people watching from our window was endlessly entertaining. By 1 a.m., the place was as quiet as could be and with the windows closed, noise is not a problem, at all any time of the day. The Ballard farmers market every summer Sunday is literally right outside the front door of the hotel, providing more people watching entertainment in the morning while we drank our complimentary coffee and also providing several inexpensive brunch opportunities. Parking in and getting ice from the neighboring hotel was as simple as could be and not the burden some other travelers have reported.Two previous criticisms are valid: the windows should have screens, and the first-floor rooms dont feel very secure if you need to open the windows for cooling, but they would be perfectly fine any time of year but summer. Despite that, this place is a super value, even at full price. Rooms are very nice the neighborhood is trendy (in a good way) and the location is a short drive to Seattle Center or downtown. I would definitely stay here again..
1	Enjoable stay, bad wi-fi. I stayed here for a few days in a double bed room.Pros:- room clean- mattress and pillows very comfortable- free wi-fi - location very good: downtown, 3 minutes from the cable car terminus on Powell Street- staff friendly and professional.Cons:- given the location, it's a bit noisy at night. Well, downtown San Francisco is a bit noisy, so I guess you'll have the same issues in any hotel there- one of the two elevators was broken, so there was only one, slow elevator serving the whole hotel. You could wait 10 minutes before getting it, so more than once I decided to take the stairs. However, this should be a temporary issue, since I saw they were working on it- the wi-fi was nearly useless--not only communicating via Skipe was impossibile (which might be understandable, given the bandwidth frequired), but also surfing the Web was a hard thing to do at times. This is really an issue they should solve, since it can be done easily and quickly- they don't serve breakfast. There's a restaurant (Puccini Pinetti) which is accessible straight from the hotel, however it opens at 11am, so you can only get a brunch. Anyway, no big issue: there is plenty of places around there where you can have breakfast.Price: I found a discount, so I think the price was fair, otherwise I would say it's a bit costy.
0	Quite spooky !. The staff was really friendly and helpfull The loccation of the hotel is great cause its only two blocks from central park , two blocks from the subway and within walking distance from cafes and restaurants The building is really old and uncleen and needs reinovation NOW ! The kitchen and everything in it was too dirty to use Wifi was available only at the lobby There was an area to chill like living room on -1 but was too spooky to chill I stayed on the 4th floor , the door of my room was broken and was really difficult to open and close The room and the bathroom were old but clean enough Also the matress and pilow was too small Finaly the heat on the room was too strong and you couldn't control it so you couldn't stay in the room nor sleep
1	A Grand Holiday from the Grand Hyatt!!. Fourth of July is a time to hit the road and with 90-100 degree temps in Chicago, I went West for the cooler air of Seattle. When I was hotel shopping I saw that the Grand Hyatt's rates were identical to many others in the area, so I decided to jump in with them. After I booked, it gave me an option to try to upgrade to a suite for 39, so, I said What the hell! and went for it.After, arriving in Seattle and taking the rail line to downtown, I emerged and walked 2 blocks to the Grand Hyatt. The lobby was quiet, intimate and spacious. Cassie welcomed me and began to check me in. She confirmed she upgraded me to the Emerald suite and told me I really gotten a good deal! I hope so, I though to my self. I ended up on the top floor with an amazing view of the sound, as well as much of downtown.The suite was awesome. It is hard to describe such an amazing room, with the view and all. It just sort of takes your breath away for a minute and you just soak it all in. None of the pictures here do this property justice. If you like what you see, you will be even more impressed when you are there. The suite did not even look like a hotel room, but rather some nice apartment I only wish I could afford. There were plenty of knick knacks, art, books, etc, all over. The Grand bed was - well, grand! You almost never want to get out of it. The linens were amazing, the bath stocked with every essential. Even a separate bath gel in case a bubble bath was in order (which it was one night). With more than enough room for two, several additional people could easily fit it with out any problems. Everything was neat, clean, comfortable, and housekeeping did an amazing job each day!The real gem of the hotel with Grand Club on 27. Although, not a lot of snacks, there were free sodas and juice all throughout the day. Tom, our host in the evening is the jewel holding the crown together! Beyond friendly, fun, and always on top of everything, he genuinely seemed to care! He remembered several guests drink choices from night to night (He certainly remembered mine, and I saw him acknowledge and recognize others). This level of personal attention is what sets this place apart from the rest.Watching the game on TV in the lounge, sipping a cocktail and munching on some cheese and veggies, I was quite happy. Tom seemed able to converse with kids and adults alike. Making his guests smile and happy seems to come naturally for him. Also a wealth of information on places to go, and the best way to get there, it was like having a live Google to chat with!The location of this hotel means that you really do not need a car. You can walk just about any where or a short cab ride at most. Save your money - forgo the car (and parking) and enjoy this city. There is a Starbucks and Deli in the lobby and several other Starbucks within a few blocks, so access to coffee and food are not a worry. Plenty of shopping and all the great attractions (Pike Place, Space Needle, etc) nearby!I would certainly stay here again - even if it cost a little bit more! Pamper yourself - relax and enjoy Seattle from the Grand Hyatt - it will be a a Grand Memory for sure!I appreciate you taking the time to give feedback on all the aspects of your stay with us at the Grand Hyatt Seattle. I am thrilled to hear that you chose us to spend your Fourth of July holiday with and that you were able to experience all that our hotel has to offer. Our suites are spacious and equipped with everything you need so I was glad to hear how comfortable you were. As well, I will certainly pass along the compliments to Cassie and Tom - they are truly a valuable part of our team. We look forward to welcoming you back to our hotel!Lindye W.

0	OMG...Hotel rooms dirty and no heat IN ROOM. Room had wall paper and curtain falling down Plus blanket was dirty. Can deal with that but we had no heat and maintenence staff would not be back until the morning. Room was freezing cold. I have pictures if Expedia wants to see them. Remove this hotel from your listing please.
0	Double charged me!. I was double charged !!! And the staff acknowledged this, but have done nothing to debit me back for the night I did not stay here. I wouldve given this property a perfect score, the family and i loved our room and the location. However, I am hesitant to stay here ever again for fear the hotel will just decide to make whatever fraudulent charges to my account without my permission and for nights i did Not stay there. To top that off. This shouldve been something they credited me back asap, i shouldnt still be waiting for the money in my account days and days later, i dont appreciate how slow its taking the hotel to decide to refund me and get back to me, this made me negative in my account and accumulated bank fees. And not once has the hotel offered to compensate for the charges their mistake has made on my account and will continue to make until they put the money back into my account.
1	Great Location very convenient for Union Square, tour buses, cable car etc. What's best about this hotel is its location right on Union Square. Its in the safe neighbourhood of Nob Hill but is quite close to the notorious Tenderloin district, so easy to stray into it. Its close to everything including the tour busses and if you need to get to the airport, the BART station is also within walking distance and the bart drops you right inside the airport.The staff are friendly and efficient and the hotel offers free wifi. The rooms are fine clean and well furnished but the hotel doesn't offer breakfast. We ate one morning in the Golden Gate Grill, which I wouldn't recommend but if you walk further up Post Street there is a great place called Honey, Honey Cafe.
1	San Francisco Soiree. Wonderful hotel in a great location. Staff is excellent. Our room with a terrace was outstanding with a big bathroom, bath, and shower. Our room included breakfast with great choices and excellent quality. It is at the gates of Chinatown and we walked to North Beach which is always fun and interesting. Across the street are wonderful restaurants.It's wonderful to read that you not only appreciated your stay but also our green initiatives. However, saving water doesn't mean having to skimp on a luxurious bathroom. I'm glad your accommodations and tasty breakfast left you refreshed for a day in the beautiful city of San Francisco. Safe travels home, and we look forward to having you back again soon!Warmly,Collins C., Front Office Manager
1	Nice hotel and good amenity.... I am an IHG Spire member and when IHG integrated the acquired Kimpton Hotel in 2018, I decided to try one and this is my first Kimpton and I had a great experience. The room is large, very clean, well appointed and super comfortable. Everything is a notch higher than the usual IHG brands - even the bathroom amenity is of very high quality.The hotel is in a great location but can be a challenge for getting food in the evening, and it is very convenient for transportation. Blue Line station bound for the O'Hare Airport is about 2 blocks away and it made catching my morning flight way easier than I expected.I would definitely come back again on my next business trip.
1	Best hotel in SF. Of the ten or so hotels I've stayed in in San Fran, the St. Regis is my favorite. Great location, lovely lobby and bar, and sleek modern rooms. Restaurants always left something to be desired, but looks as though a new one just opened. The service is top notch and the concierge is stellar. Sadly, like everything else in SF, the rates have gone up significantly so I don't get to stay there as often.Dear sncwalsh,Thank you for sharing your review of your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco. I am pleased to hear that we continue to be your favorite hotel in San Francisco, and sincerely appreciate your kind words regarding our staff and service. Please do not hesitate to contact me directly prior to your next visit, as we hope to welcome you back to the Best Address soon.Sincerely, Anthony Duggan Hotel Manager 415-284-4057 anthony.dugganstregis.com
0	Terribel. Dont stay here.. Valet service was aweful. We waited nearly 2 hours for our car no one seemed to have any clue about what was taking so long or what was even going on period. No regular coffee in the rooms, only decaf. Was told you had to order regular coffee from room service.... which I did, and it never showed up. No one at the desk had a clue about that either. Nor did they offer to fix it. Only that coffee is available in the lobby. Who wants to walk to the lobby in their PJs first thing in the morning for coffeeDear amp1789017,I am terribly sorry to read about your recent experience. In regards to our valet service, we do contract this service out and I appreciate you alerting us to the long wait time as this is unacceptable for our guests.We provide regular and decaf coffee in all rooms, with breakfast service as well as in our lobby so this is incredibly strange to read. I sincerely thank you for the feedback so I can reach out to our housekeeping departments and front desk to figure out what may have been the issue. This experience is not typical of the service that the St. James is capable of providing and I apologize that this is the impression that you now have of the hotel service. I would love the opportunity to change that impression. Should you decide to give us another chance, please let me know. Warmly,Jennifer DragnaGeneral Manager(504)304-4000jdragnanolahotelgroup.com
1	Value Lodging. If you need a pristine trendy hotel, with all the amenities, this is not the place for you. But if you are looking for clean, comfortable lodging, and can put up with a few items that are rough around the edges, this may be the place for you. At about 70/night this place was about half to a third of some of the more modern places that are literally next door. Our modest sized room was a true suite with a door between the bedroom and the sitting area. The bed was extremely comfortable and there was a big, clean bathroom. Staff were efficient and friendly. The breakfast was all we could ask for, and was generally kept well stocked. The breakfast rooms are large with lots of seating. As noted, there were some rough edges: the ventilation fans in our room were quite noisy the screen on our window was broken and the pool elevator was creaky, with a well outdated inspection report posted. The location in the valley is just off of I-8, with lots of restaurants and shopping nearby. We were able to get most anywhere we wanted to go to see the sights in 10-15 minutes.Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your comments regarding your recent stay with us. We appreciate all your wonderful comments. We work very hard to keep our little hotel clean and comfortable and we are aware that it needs a lot of TLC. We are also looking forward to getting a full renovation very soon, We hope to see you back once this is done. )Thank you again for staying with us.Kind regards,Laura Benson
1	Our Stay. This is an awesome hotel. The employees was the bomb. The pool was inside and it was very nice and warm. Our children did not want to get out. The breakfast and the staff was on point at all times. When we go back to GA this will be our hotel. Thanks for everything.Robin, Were glad you and your family enjoyed our indoor pool and breakfast staff. Our summer season is very busy but we strive to make every guest feel good about our location and their stay. Please feel free to contact our location on your next summer visit to Atlanta. Willis Blake DOS
1	Run down but very comfy like staying with Granny. The hotel advertises itself as being like an English Inn. I don't know about that it was typical hotel except for some faded prints of pastoral scenes on the wall. Never mind that, it was quiet and comfortable. More than adequate air conditioning except hallways were suffocating. Obviously over decades of wear and tear the fine details have been diminished a bit, and its evident that not a lot of money has gone into refinishing with fine craftsmanship (quite the opposite in fact). So it's a little shabby, but as we had an appointment in the adjoining hospital, we found the location to be absolutely phenomenal and will return to this Inn time and again whenever we need hospital services.Good morning and thank you for your recent review of your stay with us. We're glad the location was right for your stay and plan to return to us in the future. We do have some renovation plans in the works (new hallway carpeting and guest room lighting). Hopefully you'll continue to see improvements on each visit. We look forward to welcoming you again soon. Safe travels!
0	disappointing. The location and view were very impressive with very large pool and playground. The stream flowing around the facility was spectacular. The staff was very friendly. The rooms were very run down and gloomy. Our sink stopper was broke which was taken care of right away but carpet was very nasty. For what I paid I expected much more.
1	Very helpful hotel. After my husband deploying out overseas I needed some well deserved girl time weekend. We rented several rooms and was so plesently surprised wtih everything. We weren't sure what things to see in the area and did not want to miss anything worth seeing. The manager took extra time to explain food, entertainment and girl things to do in the area which he felt we wouldn't want to miss. This really helped we girl get alot of things of enjoyment thanks to him. We found most things close to hotel and rooms were clean. I look foward to more girls weekends there.
1	Excellent cost-benefit. The hotel is well located, 10 minutes drive from Downtown, Balboa Park and Zoo. Comfortable rooms and llimpos daily, a good breakfast with several options. The internet is not good and needs to be improvedGood Afternoon,Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel! We are so glad you enjoyed your stay here. Thank you for your compliments to the property and the breakfast, and thank you for your feedback about the Internet- we will look into ways of making sure that guest's don't have any issues with connecting in the future. We hope to see you again the next time you're in the San Diego area! Thank you again!Sincerely,MadisonGuest Relations

0	This place is a huge rip off!. I went to stay at this hotel and ordered a jacuzzi suite which is suppose to be one of the nicest of their rooms. I go in the rook is huge. It looks nice but as the day goes on I kill at least 8 stink bugs, the bugs that emit a disgusting smell when killed. I use the jacuzzi tub and one of the jets do not work some of the towles have this yellow residue on it and the tub wasnt completely clean. I check out today to find out they charged me 150 dollars because I left some tobacco in the trash which they institute as smoking. I make my own cigarettes so sometimes I do not use all of the tobacco but if I wouldve known I would be charged 150 dollars for leaving tobacco around I would have never went to this hotel. I did not smoke in the room at all and i know it smells nothing like smoke so I do not understand what constitutes the charge of 150 dollars. The general manager was not there so I have to wait until Monday.Our entire hotel is non-smoking. We do charge one hundred and fifty dollars when a guest smokes in the room. We did have several smoking area around the hotel so our guest can smoke outside.Willis Blake DOS
0	A 363.00 night at this Comfort Inn! Yes! this was the room rates for 2 queen beds!. I was checked in by a young lady who did not welcome me and was talking to other staff while checking me in. She gave me a room key that did not work. After traveling 400 miles by car that day...and having to carry my luggage to my room, this was not a pleasant experience. I returned to her...she did...

0	Do NOT book here - you will be scammed!. We booked here for a week months ago. As our cruise dates changed, we emailed our cancellation notice. We received confirmation of the cancellation and was shocked to find out that our Visa was charged the first night despite the fact that we had cancelled a week prior to our arrival.Our Visa company is now trying to recuperate our funds, but no reputable hotel would be so underhanded. ALL attempts to communicate the management/owners of the hotel has been to no avail.Do NOT book here unless you are 100 sure, do not risk it. We're out over 100 US but it's the principle of it that hurts us more than the money! Shysters!
0	I GOT RIPPED. The place was good, but upon checkout I was told they would apply my 40.00 gift card plus an email of my check out. Neither happened. The location is central and the room is good. We had a patio. The staff was not very helpful. The location is on hotel row with 20 other hotels you could chose from. You might try Hampton Inn or one of the others. It is right by the freeway.Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your feedback. On behalf of our entire team we would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. Please know your comments will be shared with the appropriate Department Heads and Staff for specific training purposes, as guest satisfaction and meeting their expectations are extremely important to us. We are however happy to inform you that we have redeemed your gift card and refunded your card, we sent a receipt to your email hopefully you received it. Once again, we apologize for any inconvenience and we hope that you will consider staying with us again so that we can have another chance to provide you with a superior experience. Thank you!
1	Carter, from the valet group was amazing. We recently stayed at the Westin for a conference. The hotel and hotel staff were great. We interacted mainly with the restaurant/bar lobby staff and they were all helpful, friendly. The standout came from Carter the last night of the show. After attending a few networking events, we came back to the hotel after last call and with most places around us closed. Being a week night, the downtown area shut down pretty quickly. Carter made several recommendations and was extremely personable (I know we couldn't have been an easy group). While we waited for our food to be delivered I watched Carter park a few cars, speak with guests as they entered and made sure the entrance of the hotel was clean and tidy for guests. It's always nice to see people doing their jobs with a smile on their face. Thanks Carter!AubreeJean - I am so happy to read you enjoyed your entire experience. Our valet team is one of the best and I appreciate your taking the time to recognize their efforts, specifically Carter! Thank you for the 5 star review on Trip Advisor and we hope you will come back and stay with us again, should your travels bring you to San Diego. Be Well, Alyssa Turowski, General Manager
1	Clean and comfortable Hotel. Staff were very friendly in general. Breakfast had a good selection. Rooms were kept clean and towels provided daily. We noticed a lot of school parties stay here and that some people hung out in the hallways which generated some noise. We were not impressed that 2 nights in a row we had to evacuate at around midnight taking our sleeping son out of his crib/cot. Lounge was not open through the week only on a Friday and Saturday - depending where you stay in hotel you may hear some noise. We arrived on a Friday night and there was a function on we had to park far away but there is plenty of parking available. Our room had a Refrigerator, microwave, Iron plus board. There was a slight concern for us as we were told that there may be no cribs left but thankfully we did get one. We were disappointed that the swimming pool was only open 6pm-10pm Mon-Fri and on Saturday and Sunday's it was 2pm-10pm. There is a small shop in foyer where you can buy essentials and various other items and there is also a computer and printer in this area too.
0	Don't book this hotel. The hotel is located next to a very noisy highway. The bathroom was very dirty and the room cooling/heating unit was very noisy. I was not made aware that there was a breakfast included so I could at least enjoy something from this hotel. I checked out after the first night of a 2 night stay and went to the Hilton Bayfront for almost the same money and a MUCH BETTER experience.Dear Bernard B,Thank you for taking the time to write a review and we appreciate your feedback. We are sorry you had some noise issues and concerns with your room and if you had let the front desk know, we would have done our best to move you to a more quiet room and address your concerns. Our on-site restaurant, Seven Seas Caf serves breakfast, lunch and dinner.Sincerely,Best Western Seven Seas Management Staff
1	Nice escape from the mega hotels. Stayed here during a conference being held at the mega hotel Hilton up the block from Abri. Glad I chose the Abri, medium sized, clean hotel in a Union Square central location. My room was small but perfectly formed and the walk-in shower was powerful. My room had a strange smell to it during my stay which meant I had to have the window open most of the time for fresh air. Ask for an inner room to avoid noise from the busy street outside.I visited SF about 5 years ago so was shocked at the amount of homeless people everywhere this time round. Every street corner was filled with people begging so be prepared to have your dollar bills ready. Breakfast downstairs in the restaurant was good. Great shopping near by. Enjoy!
0	would not recommend. the rooms ac was leaking causing the floor to be wet around the window and ac. the hair dryer and phone didnt work. the fire alarm went off in the middle of the night. the sheets had crumbs and sparkles on them. Maintenance fixed the problems but its ridiculous they dont inspect their products.
0	Poor Customer Service. Spoke with someone in the group reservations department about blocking rooms for a wedding was told I'd get a call back with answers to my questions by the end of the day! Up until that point, the person I spoke with was great.. Then thats where the greatness stopped... We're now 2+ weeks later with no call back, I've... More
0	Over Priced. Paid double what it was worth because there was nothing else available. The staff was nice but that's as far as the pros go. Hair on bathroom floor, bed hard as a rock and and the room looks like it has not been updated since the 90's. If your passing through, just keep driving.
1	Best place for what I need. I always try to stay at the Hyatt House whenever I'm in Seattle for business. The rooms are studio apartments and extremely well kept and clean. The staff is knowledgeable and helpful. The bar / kitchen is open late and the breakfast is pretty good for a free meal. This is not the place for people looking for a luxury experience with a ton of amenities. It's centrally located to Seattle landmarks and if you're lucky you get a view of the Space Needle.Dear JenK Wow! Your header says it all. I am so happy to hear this and that you felt the Hyatt house was exactly what you need. Thank you also for being a repeat guest. Any time we get a 5 star review we celebrate it as a team. I am glad the our larger rooms and knowledgeable staff made your stay great. We hope to see you soon weather it be for business or pleasure! Sincerely,Jonathan
0	Stay here as a last resort. First off, even with my credit card number, they would not hold the room past 8 PM! Old funky room, fairly clean except for overlayed cigarette stink, cig ashes on the coffee tray, cobwebs in the bathroom, smoke detector removed very little sound proofing between rooms, but that was OK because we had the A/C roaring all night to deal...

1	One of the best hotels in NYC.. We were there for a long weekend to celebrate my birthday. I would say that the best part of the hotel is the staff. They pamper you from beginning to end. The staff in the restaurant is wonderful. They really take care of you and make you feel welcome. They greet you by name each time they see you. We had breakfast twice and ate ate lunch once. The quality of the food is great too. The room was very nice. We were upgraded to a bigger room with a view towards the park. The location of the hotel is great: close to 5th avenue shopping, Central Park and not far from the theater district. The only part that I think needs to be remodeled is the entrance/lobby area. It's a little cramped and dark for a hotel of this quality. They were remodeling the outside though.
0	Nice hotel, but no WiFi or wired Internet. Hotel is in a good location, just West of I-75 on the eastern edge of Tampa. In a very heavy retail area with just about any shopping or eateries very close by - probably want to drive to them as the Hotel is on Highway 60, a very wide road with traffic speeding recklessly by in both directions. Large, well-lit... More
0	bad experience... There were more cons than pros for the 4 nights that my family stayed here. 14 people were on this trip and we rented 3 rooms. Unfortunately, the room that i ended up with had many problems. All 3 rooms were non-smoking room, but right when i walked into the room, you can smell the aroma of cigarettes. The second problem faced was the dysfunctional microwave in the room. We called the front desk to come fix it for us, they were nice enough to come see what was wrong with it and come fix it however, i don't know what they fixed because the microwave did not heat up the food at all. The third, but biggest, problem was the BED BUGS! Even though they might say their hotel is bug free, we faced these little pests late at night. My son was bitten many times(pictures included) and I was bit once on my eyebrow on the last night. Luckily, we caught one bug that was still moving around in the morning and showed them to the front desk. We asked for a discount because all the nights we stayed there were met with discomfort however the best they did for us was a discount for one night. We called the manager and explained our situations after our stay and he wasn't much of a help either.Thank you for expressing your concerns in regards to your recent experience at the Best Western Miramar. The concerns you have raised are very understandable given what you described, and I appreciate the opportunity to look into it and respond.The global resurgence of bed bugs over the last five years is a widely-recognized problem. It is suspected that this resurgence is a direct result of increased international travel to and from the United States, since bed bugs are easily transported in suitcases, clothing, and purses among other things. To address this growing problems, we have a continuous pest control policy in place at our property and have implemented a thorough training program for our housekeeping and maintenance personnel to assist in the early recognition of infestation.Our certified pest control vendor has visited the property and assures us that there is no current infestation on property. Given the nature of our business, it is our expressed commitment to make sure every guest experience an enjoyable one. Your comfort and satisfaction are very important to us, as you have had a chance to see. We appreciate you taking your time to stay with and write review.

1	Beautiful hotel, so why ruin that. Embassy Suites are always beautiful, open spaces and comfortable rooms. This one, across the river from the National Mall, didn't disappoint in it's appearance and cleanliness. But I'm confused why the room service policy doesn't include timely pick-up of used dishes. We saw numerous trays of dirty dinner dishes on the hallway floors 12 to 15 hours after delivery. Seems it would be much cleaner and less (potential) bug-attracting to collect those dishes early in the morning, before breakfast is served. This issue seemed tacky to me, its the kind of thing guests shouldn't have an opportunity to observe. Instead, guests can't help but walk past lots of dirty dishes on their way to breakfast. Equally, dining room staff needs to be sufficient to keep the tables clean at the same rate of guest arriving for breakfast...or at least give us a place near the kitchen to bus our own trays! I saw lots of folks trying to find a clean table, while lots of other folks were trying to clean up after themselves. Aside from this issue, the staff bent over backwards for every question, request or incident.
1	Glad we came back!. We have stayed at this Hilton Garden Inn before, and so glad we came back. We enjoyed dinner in the restaurant, and highly recommend the wings, and the flatbread pizza. We had great service, thanks Tee. Preston at the front desk was very kind, and helpful. The airport shuttle was so easy, and stress free thanks to Benny. Looking forward to our next stay!Wow - Denise, thank you for choosing to return to the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport. We are delighted to know you had a great dining experience at our on-site restaurant and that you were impressed with the top-notch service provided by our associates. I will be sure to share your compliments with the staff mentioned in your review. It was a pleasure having you here, and we look forward to welcoming you and your family again soon.Sincerely,Michael GoldwasserGeneral ManagerHilton Garden Inn Orlando Airport
0	Very poor hotel. The first room we were given had a smell like a wet dog, blanket was dirty and room was not real clean. We were given a second room, it also smelled, but as if someone had just cleaned this room. No coffee pot, however, there was coffee in the room, the carpet had not been cleaned well as there was...

0	You get what you pay for. Our first impression was that the hotel was just run down. Our room had broken furniture, disintegrating drywall and wood, an air conditioner that left a growing shopping wet puddle and beds a pillows that no one would find comfortable. The continental breakfast consisted of slices of bread, waffles, bagels, fruit loops and apples. To bad for you if you are gluten intolerant or just want some protein for breakfast. The free shuttle only picked up twice a day and would leave on our before the scheduled time so you had better be there early. You still might not get on, because it's just a large van and they had to call a second shuttle for you to wait for. The hotel staff could be rude and curt or helpful and curt, it's a roulette. By the end of our stay the maids didn't seem to care. They just threw the covers on no matter what was under them and didn't bother to clean. Since it's just a place to lay down after the amusement parks I guess if serves is purpose.
0	Hotel is awful!. Second time in a row that we have had an awful experience with the hotel booked through your website. Your website gave the hotel 3.2 stare. I would agree if the scale was out of 100, not 5. One of the two queen beds had the mattress springs bulging through surface. The bathroom was dirty and I killed 3 roaches.
0	THEFT!!!. DO NOT STAY HERE!!!! Someone from this hotel stole my husbands watch off the bathroom counter. He immediately notified them and they did nothing about it. His was was a Christmas gift from his daughter and I. You should be able to trust where you stay. Untrustworthy people work here.
1	Corporate, yes, but it was very pleasant. Thanks to American Airlines I found myself stranded in the Windy City for one night. First a faulty door, then poor weather and then returning to the gate to refuel (surely they should have thought about that one). Either way I wasn't going home, but heading straight for the Marriott O'Hare in Chicago, which, while on one level, not a great thing, on another, it meant I could mooch around Chicago for the day, which I did.The Marriott O'Hare was very much in the corporate mould, the sort of place where I find air hostesses normally Asian checking in ahead of me and sure enough there they were, but the check-in procedure was remarkably smooth and helpful. However, finding the room and then finding my way from the room back to the front desk area was tricky at one stage I was lost in a maze of corridors and had to retrace my steps back to the room and then start again, taking a right turn instead of a left. But this was a minor problem in the scheme of things.The hotel room was very nice. Too many pillows on the bed, but then all Marriotts seem to suffer from that affliction. There was WiFi, but it wasn't free which I always find a diabolical liberty and, oddly, it's always the big chain hotels that request payment, the ones that, arguably, don't need the money. Smaller hotels seem to offer it for free and, let's face it, the Marriott could too, but it chooses to charge. It was all academic to me as the airline had checked in my bag, which contained my laptop, so I only had the business centre on the ground floor, which I would use the following day. In fact, on the subject of the business centre, it was fine and they allowed me to use it AFTER I had checked out, which was kind of them, so I did get my free WiFi after all. Extend free internet access to the rooms and you'd get a 'very good' rating from me.It was late or getting late by the time I reached the lobby and took a seat for dinner, although only a limited menu was available to me. I ordered a glass of Cabernet and the fish dish and it was fine. Breakfast the following morning was excellent they had everything and it was all top quality. I ordered fresh fruit and some bread plus a bowl of cereal (something like Alpen) along with a pot of tea. But once again, where the tea was concerned, I remembered that if I fancied a decent cuppa I would have to wait until I reached England. There's never a pot of tea in the USA, but there's more likely to be a pot of hot water and a teabag in a sachet and that was the offering at the Marriott. But again, not a major worry.There was a shuttle bus to the airport and, after mooching around Chicago (definitely not my kinda town) I'd driven back to the Marriott in a taxi (having taken the CTA into downtown from Cumberland, a station across the parking lot from the hotel) and sat at the bar with a glass of Cabernet awaiting the call from the shuttle driver. The shuttle runs every 20 minutes and takes about 20 minutes to reach the airport.I'm one of those people who tend not to like the corporate hotels, but then, everytime I find myself in a Marriott or a Hyatt, I have nothing but praise for them perhaps I do like corporate hotels and that 'brand reassurance' they offer. I could have done with another night at the Marriott O'Hare and, preferably, under calmer circumstances. Marriotts are good hotels. I liked the Cleveland Marriott and the one in Atlanta and I'll forgive them leaving too many pillows on the beds. Keep up the good work.Mr. Moggridge! Thank you for writing about your stay! I thoroughly enjoyed your writing and thank you for the positive comments. As well as noting what we could improve on. I hope this note finds you at your destination. Wishing you safe travels and a pleasant summer. Dieter Heigl
1	My favorite place to stay in New Orleans. Best staff ever. Good price. Great location for The Garden District and Tulane. Steps away from St. Charles Streetcar. Short walk to Magazine Street. Breakfast only okay, but the best they can do. Parking is always available, but closer parking permits are limited so you may have to park a block away. Safe neighborhood. Only problem: toilet seats don't stay up.Thank you so much for your review! We always enjoy seeing you. I'm glad to read that we are your favorite place to stay in New Orleans! Our breakfast, location, and parking make us a convenient hotel for visiting the city, especially the Garden District and Tulane.We look forward to seeing the next time you are in town!Kathleen Davis, Front Office Manager
0	Fleas. We were given a room infested with fleas. First noticed while lying in bed and got bit. Thought it was a fleeting incident and left for the day. That night I was in bed and felt them on me, I got up walked across room and saw fleas were all over my lower legs. Needless to say I did not sleep that night. First thing in the morning asked for a new room and they did move us, however I was paranoid the fleas got into my things and would come home with me. So I felt very anxious and uncomfortable the rest of my stay. I have bite marks all over my legs. They didn't even offer a discount of any kind off that room price.Thank you for taking the time to write your review. I am very sorry that happened during your stay. I am very glad we were able to move you to another room, and we have gotten the original room taken care of. We do have a cleaning policy in place when we know a pet has been in a room. There was no record of any pets in that room for several months. Unfortunately, it sounds like someone may have had a pet in that room without us knowing. I have contacted you by phone, and would be happy to discuss this with you further.Thank you,Melissa AlbertGeneral Managermalbertstcharlesinn.net
1	Nice Hotel, But Be Prepared To Pay For EVERYTHING. I stayed here for a night, to attend a meeting held at the hotel. The room was very good. The staff was excellent. Even thought all of the rooms empty out into the courtyard area, it still is fairly quiet (thankfully). The hotel itself is well located, there is plenty of parking, and there are many options for eating within the hotel. The breakfast buffet was pretty good and that was a decent price for a buffet (14). The only complaint I have is they charge a small fortune for most everything! A 20 ounce soft drink is 3.49, A small bag of chips or pretzels are 2 for 3.49. Ok, most people might not care, but to me, if I am paying a decent amount for the room, why do I need to be gouged for every day itemsI don't believe I will stay here again, unless there is another business meeting, to which I need to attend.Thank you for your feedback, it truly helps us improve our product and services. I will review our pricing with my Operations Manager to ensure we are competitive and not over priced. I hope to see you back at the Waverly in the future!
1	Nice New Hotel. Nice New Hampton Hotel. Rooms were very clean, Comfy Beds. Close to walking paths and down town Napa. Staff was friendly ! Great place to stay. Walking paths along the Napa River make it nice way to start the day.Dear Paul O,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We're glad to hear that you enjoyed our comfy beds and that you we're able to take advantage of our walking path that runs along the river just behind the hotel. We look forward to serving you again in the near future. Thank you, Serina Najar.
1	Great location, very modern. My wife and I very much enjoyed our stay for a quick Baltimore weekend getaway. The hotel is small but the rooms are big. There were a lot of mirrors, and the kitchenette allowed for a second sink and counter top to get ready. We were on the second floor, so the noise from the street was pretty loud, but not to the point where it kept either of us up all night. The breakfast is a pseudo-hot breakfast... no eggs or meat but it did have a waffle maker. Location is perfect, but at night it gets loud and rowdy, and there was some police activity just a block down (nothing bad, just drunken party goers). I would definitely stay here again.
1	Good value, don't expect too much.. Great hotel, wonderful hospitality, staff funny and very helpful. Rooms nice and clean. Beds comfortable. We were in a suite, the living room was comfy, ample workspace for two people. We were there the week before Mardi Gras on a business trip. Check in evening, our toilet overflows, we use all the towels in the bathroom to mop after we disable the float. Call to front desk. Immediate response. Front desk guy has a plunger and a plastic bag, comes in an plunges the toilet. Clears the paper. Says he's not supposed to plunge toilets. Leaves us with wet towels (and used toilet water) behind the toilet. Fortunately, the room is not level, so all the water stays mostly behind the toilet. Housekeeping gone, so fortunately, we still had two clean towels for a.m. and the detritus is not near our feet. Next day, some towels replaced, and housekeeper leaves cleaning products in bathroom and skimpy on towels. Second day, housekeeper leaves cleaning products in bathroom. Third day I notice that a little piece of plastic wrapping that I had binding some brochures in my suitcase was still laying on the floor in the bedroom. Shower has not great water pressure but is nice and roomy too. Hair dryer was awful. One day we were still in the room when housekeeping came, and when we came back in the early evening our room was not done. A call to front desk and our room was cleaned (with the leftover spray bottle in the bathroom) by time we got back from dinner.So, it's clean but some staff are a little forgetful. I was not bothered by the issues, it's a quirky little hotel. With a quirky staff...very laid back and quite fun!What did bother me, though, was one day I went down for breakfast. A youth bus group had been there the night before and they devestated the free breakfast bar. By 7:30 a.m. (the breakfast is open until 9 or so), most of the hot food was gone, and the server said they were done for the day. Huh Otherwise, the breakfast bar was nice, all the usual stuff. The evening reception was really nice. The hotel is close to convention center, French Quarter, and all the fun places.Overall, I'd stay there again, I'm hoping that the housekeeping issues were quirks and next time I'm bringing my own hair dryer. It did have free internet in the rooms, a huge plus.
0	Don't Be Fooled by Annex at THE Chelsea. So there is the nice side the Chelsea, but when that side is sold out, the website does not tell you and directs you to book at room at The Annex at The Chelsea. OMG, it is like a motel. The room had duck tape on the connecting door to the next room, the front door wouldn't lock. The TV was old and small, There wasn't internet connection on this ghetto side of the Chelsea. Walking to the darkside, the hallway was dim and the elevator was frightening. You gambled with your life each trip on that thing. Be careful and stay on The Chelsea side, do not venture to the motel The Annex at the Chelsea.
1	Perfect location. This hotel is in the perfect location! A half block from Broadway Times Square in the Theater District. The lobby is nothing special, as is the streetfront of the hotel. Our room was clean and very nice. We had a King Deluxe. The bed was ok, not bad, but not exceptional. The toiletries in the bathroom were great! I usually don't use them, but I loved them all. The continental breakfast offered a nice array of options, and was well stocked. The coffee was very good. The free wi-fi was a nice bonus.We had a bit of a problem checking in. We arrived at about 11:30am. I had been told the day before, that it was possible that our room could be ready by 10:30 am, although check in was officially at 4pm. Our room was not ready, so we left our bags, with a promise that we'd be texted as soon as our room was ready. We checked back at about 3pm, even tho we had not been texted. Still not ready, they'd text. We came back about seven, still no text, and were finally able to check in. As we checked in, I heard someone asking about a wine and cheese hour. We had missed it! I remarked to my husband, that I would have loved a glass of wine after such a hectic day. The male who checked us in heard me, and asked what kind of wine we liked, and said that he would send some up, on the house! Within minutes, two bottles of wine, on ice and 2 glasses arrived. To be able to relax in our room, with a glass of wine, really made up for our late check in! The whole staff was very nice and I would definitely stay there again.
1	Hidden Gem!. Needed a place to stay in SD, was going to stay at my normal big chain hotels when I went looking to see how much a hotel closer to the ocean was and this hotel popped up at the same price I would have paid at a Hotel Circle hotel. Hm, freeway view or ocean view! Just the thought of being by the ocean was all it took. The staff was very friendly, and can't wait until June to go back. Older building, but nicely renovated, and you have a refrigerator unlike the expensive hotels that do not! Great place to visit!Great review Mannie! Hope to see you back soon

The hotel has been remodeled, but it is an older hotel and the remodel did not include the kind of construction and soundproofing you typically find in a Hampton Inn (I travel regularly and stay...

0	Go elsewhere. Breakfast buffet worthy of a motel 6, showing the chain's true heritage. Most Intercons I've stayed at WW, have a much higher levels of service, training and food quality. This no frills meal served at Luce was a waste of 30.
0	Be careful. We stayed for 2 nights and 2 nights was enough. We found one cockroach on the first night and one in the morning on the second day. There was dust all over the fixtures. Our sheets smelled off, not clean. I probably won't stay in a days inn again.
1	Great stay. The Club Quarters is a good hotel to stay at if you are looking for a place to stay with a good price and within walking distance to clubs and the Toyota center. We were able to take a short 10 minute walk to the Toyota center at night as well as bars and clubs nearby. The only complaint I would have is that parking is not free as the hotel itself does not have a parking area. There is a parking lot nearby where you can pay for meter parking but need to insert cash into the meter every so often which is tricky because you can forget. Valet price wasn't bad, 25 for 24 hours and you can come in and out as many times as you want with no extra charge. We chose this option and it worked out great because we didn't have to worry about our car. Hotel has free water bottles downstairs, a keurig machine in the rooms, a kitchen area with a small fridge, stove and microwave and glassware inside the room, and a coffee machine in the lobby.
0	Rip off. I was quoted a price over the phone of 383 weekly and even used my credit card to hold the room. On the day of check in i arrived and my room wasn't even ready even after 5pm then I was told that room would be over 500 per week and i couldn't afford that. All the man at the... More

0	Horrible, bedbags. Infected of fleas and thumbtacks, bedbags infected. The people of receipt know the problem and nevertheless it rents the rooms. Hotel to demand
1	Very nice hotel. I found this hotel quite comfortable to stay at. Business conditions required that I work overnight and sleep during the day, and the blackout curtain was quite effective at keeping out light. I almost never heard any noise from other rooms or the hallway either, and city noise was nonexistent away from the window (except for the occasional siren). Hotel staff was very helpful with any requests. The exercise room has a lot of equipment for workouts. The bed was very comfortable. Room service is a bit pricey.Hello Daniel S, many thanks for your great review on your recent stay at W Seattle. It sounds like you were BUSY while here! I am thrilled to hear that you enjoyed the black out shade as well as the room stayed nice and quiet for you to get some rest! We do look forward to welcoming you back next time you are in the city. Thanks again!
1	Clean and Friendly. I had planned a last minute trip in to Anaheim to go for a Birthday event at Disney, the entire city was sold out but Townplace had a few rooms available. We generally dont stay this far away from Disney but we had no choice. Room rates were out of control because of a conference and most hotels were sold out! I have to say we were pleasantly surprised with the hotel. My experience at check -in was fantastic, the rooms were clean the energy was good and overall we didn't care that we were a few miles away from Disney. We Were happy with our stay. The only thing I could say that I was not crazy about was the commuter train that passes through the back of the Hotel. Other than that I would recommend this place to any of my friends or family membersWe appreciate your business and value your honest feedback. Your comments have been shared withthe hotel team as a critical way of understanding how we can continue to deliver exceptional serviceto guests like you.Thank you for staying at the TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium and we hope you choose to create more memories withus whenever your travels bring you back to Anaheim.Sincerely,Edgar RiveraGeneral Manager edgar.riveramarriott.com
0	Will never stay there again. First off they way over charged me. Beds were terrible had cigarette burns in the comforter. Entry ways to rooms smelt terrible. Stains and trash on the floor. Safe was not functional. Toilet was stained. There was mold on the window drapes. Emergency exit would not shut or lock. Cigarette butts all over the ground out side of the room. Pool was not functional. Trash on room patios. There was a Bullet hole in a window.
1	Excellent find at the end of the road... Spent one night here after travelling from Orlando through the Everglades and the Keys. Excellent first impression, clean, bright lobby, quick check in and a fantastic concierge who provided us with maps and advised on local attractions, etc. The room was a good size with TV, fridge, adequate storage space and complimentary toiletries and hairdryer in the bathroom. I was travelling with a friend and had booked a King room prior to arrival (there had been no other options on the website), however, reception offered us double queen room at no extra cost on check in. Breakfast consisted of hot and cold items sausage patties, eggs, waffles, bagels, toast, pastries, cereal, yoghurt, orange juice, tea/coffee. Good quality and plenty available. Available in the lobby and included in the room rate.The only thing that lets this hotel down slightly is the location. The main Street in Key West is Duval street, which is a good hours walk from the hotel. A taxi costs upwards of 20 dollars. We had a rental car and ended up driving a lot of the street parking is permit only and the car parks are expensive but we managed to park for free on a residential street. Perhaps a shuttle to and from the hotel would be a nice extra touch.A good hotel, would stay again if travelling back to Key West.Thank you for your comments and feedback. So glad you enjoyed your visit to our property and had an excellent first impression. The team does an amazing job maintaining the cleanliness of the rooms, and getting our guest checked in quickly so they can enjoy the Island. Thanks for staying with us. Hope to see you back soon.
0	Never Going Back. This hotel was underwhelming. Even though it is newer construction it had an old feel to it. They put me in the wrong room to begin with. I booked a room with 2 queen beds and a pull out. That is not what I got. I had to wait for the room I booked to be cleaned. When we did... More
1	Great experience. I was very pleased with the room we stayed in. It was clean and updated. We had a microwave, fridge and table in our room. The staff was very friendly and helpful. There are parrots right outside your door which are fun to watch. This hotel is located in close proximity to Sea World and several beaches. We had a blast and would definitely recommend. Dear Conniet,We are delighted your recent stay with us provided you with such a great experience and are appreciative of your 5-star rating! We take pride in providing our guests with friendly customer service, clean, comfortable accommodations, and special amenities to make their stay with us a memorable experience. We hope we will have the opportunity to have you and your family back as our guests again in the future!
0	Lipstick on a pig. I understand that it is quite likely a great improvement over years past, however the refresh is superficial only. The floors still creak and were bowed and the climate control is minimal. The provided window air conditioner has not been serviced in some time and the air was not cool. I'm also concerned that the shampoo, shower gel and conditioner are not properly secured. I feel like someone had contaminated the shampoo, as it had a terrible smell, which unfortunately I did not discover until after I had it in my hair. The attached restaurant is well above average for the area and is the only redeeming quality in my opinion. The restaurant hours could be improved for in-house guestsHello fastboxter, please accept my sincere apology if we failed your standards during your stay. Our goal is make sure that guest experience is satisfactory and enjoyable. I have shared your comment with department managers in charge so we can improve and make the necessary changes. Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention.
1	Top Shelf. Just complete a stay at St. Regis for our anniversary. Reached out to the hotel in advance and they took great care of us. Had a room on the 16th floor with spectacular city views. Check in was efficient and friendly. Room was large and well appointed - very luxurious. My wife enjoyed the soaker tub. Hotel provided a special amenity in celebration of our anniversary - we very much appreciated the special attention. Used the pool area which had lots of sun and city views. St. Regis beats Ritz and Four Seasons hands down in SF. Thanks for a great stay. Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your review of your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco. We are delighted to hear that you had an exceptional stay with us and appreciate your kind words regarding our staff and service. We are honored that you chose our hotel to celebrate your special occasion and hope to welcome you back to best address soon.Sincerely,Anthony DugganHotel Manager415-284-4057Anthony.dugganstregis.com
1	Great Location for access to the Medical District Hospitals. Stayed here on business with the University of Illinois Medical Center. The negative of a hotel in the Medical District is the sirens. Lots of ambulances coming to the Medical Centers. That and the charge for internet access were the only negatives I experienced here, and I will admit that paying for internet access is a pet peeve of mine. The ambulances they have no control over. The hotel has a modern contemporary appearance. The lobby was bright and inviting with a sitting area offering complementary Wall Street Journal and USA Today. Every staff member I encountered was cheerful and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable, with complementary coffee/tea, a refrigerator, and a great work area. I was not able to see any restaurants within walking distance so I opted for the hotel restaurant/bar. The food was excellent as was the service and all reasonably priced for Chicago. They do have a shuttle service available however, I did not use it and unable to comment. Coming back in two-weeks and will be staying here again, even though I have to pay for internet access. :-)QuitemanTravels,Thank you very much for taking the time to review your stay with us, and I am so happy to hear how satisfied you were with your experience. I appreciate your kind words concerning our staff and facilities, and will make sure to share them with our Team.As you mentioned, we do offer special rates for those visiting the Illinois Medical District as well as the University of Illinois at Chicago.We also have several package rates that include wifi and parking, as a way to lower the costs of these amenities. Our wifi price does also include all local and long-distance calls made from the room.As well as our wonderful restaurant that you had a chance to experience, we are walking distance from Little Italy, and a complimentary shuttle-ride from Greektown.Thank you again for taking the time to write about your stay, and please feel welcome to contact me if you are in Chicago again soon.In the Spirit to Serve,Adam NemirowHotel Manager
0	BED BUGS!! STAY AWAY!!!. I stayed and was almost eaten alive by bed bugs - Cost 118 doctor visit and ruined my vacation- reported to local health authority but received a reply back that since bedbugs are not known to transmit diseases and there are no public health laws addressing requirements for their control and removal they would not investigate or require action.

1	Felt Like A Resident. A luxury hotel can often curtail you from experiencing the local culture I've certainly experienced this at many hotels. This Ritz Carlton however, provides luxury and immerses you with the local culture. Like what many neighbors of the Ritz Carlton experience, I felt like I was returning to a luxury residence building. You enter effortlessly past bellman that remember you, and into what feels more like a private foyer rather than a lobby. From there you can be up to your room in no-time given elevators that you rarely have to wait on and our rooms proximity to the elevator - which is what I loved given my 35pound dog traveled with me.The Parkview Guestroom we had on the 6th floor was beautifully decorated and had unforgettable views into the park. Since it was winter, we were able to look right into the park - specifically viewing a sanctuary and large pond. The room was also very well laid out, and even with a rollaway bed it felt spacious.A spa treatment at the onsite LaPrairie Spa was very private and relaxing. Auden Bistro the Star Lounge feature classic menus with discrete service. Espressos ordered through Room Service arrived quickly and hot. And the complimentary coffee and tea in the bar was appreciated.The Ritz Carlton certainly extends their service and amenities to pets as well. My dog was treated like a prince! He was given several welcome amenities and genuinely recognized by the staff each time he passed through the lobby.The purpose of this stay was to celebrate my mom's birthday with my parents. They recognized the celebration and provided a unique amenity for my mom - a large silver frame with the Ritz Carlton logo! I even really enjoyed the location, with a great espresso bar around the corner, a very casual Italian restaurant recommended by the concierge, and of course the park.Some staff outshines others, there is a faint sound of street noise from the 6th floor, and there's the smell of horses when in front of the property - but none of this takes away from the hotel's well deserving status of being a Forbes 5 Star AAA 5 Diamond property. I will return.
1	It was a really good experience!. We stayed in this hotel or motel, because we were on a budget. And it really served its purpose. We prefered have more money to spend on dinners and on the parks, than to spend it in a hotel room that its only use is to get a good shower and a good night's sleep. It served just that. It was really practical. The staff were REALLY friendly, the parking was really safe, they monitered all cars, to make sure you were their guests. Checking in was a breeze. We were placed on the third floor, and it had a beautiful view to the Island of Adventure's Hulk and Towers. Its your average room, with average bed and furniture. The beds were comfortable, and plenty of sheets and pillows. There is a safe available free of charge, but you have to ask the key in the front desk. The safe is big enough to put your Ipad and documents. The towels could use an upgrade. There is a tv, with local channels. The A/C worked fine and it didnt make any funny noises. We even had to lower the temperature at some point. There is a mini fridge that worked superb! We went to Walmart and bought bottle of waters for the parks and we put in snacks as well. Housekeeping was pretty good some days, other days they just forget to put enough towels. The lighting in the room was pretty bad. The bathroom light sometimes came on, other times we dependend on the light of the room. Another weird detail is that the hotel room key is not your average magnetic key... It worked like a hard plastic card with weird holes. So if you loose that key, it would become troublesome to get an easy replacement. The telephone didnt work, and yes.. No wifi in room. The ice machine does cost you an extra fee, like .25 per bucket... But since we had bottles of ice cold water, that wasnt an issue. We didnt have any hidden fee, and it was a really great stay. Easy to locate and very centric in the International Drive. Close to everything: restaurants, parks, gas stations, outlet malls, cinema. GREAT, GREAT LOCATION!!!! About 20 min to Disney Parks, and 3 min car drive to Universal Studios Parks If you have simple needs, this is really your place to stay! Would recommend, and would stay again in a heartbeat! :) great christmas vacations in Orlando.
0	The hotel was nice, it was in a nice area down the street.... The hotel was nice, it was in a nice area down the street from mall close to highways and Walmart. I rated this place poor because I stayed two nights I didn't have hot water until around 9pm the second night. I had to go to a girlfriends to shower. The police also was having a sting all day and all night so that was scary.
0	No frills...absoluntely none.. Frightening. The only good thing about the hotel was the free parking and convenience to the French Quarter. High price for what they provided. Below par for even a budget hotel.
0	Oh my!. Our stay was only 2 nights:Pro: location to the beachCons: shower was either cold or hotleaky toiletno acthe comforters were not clean (smelled like body odor)the pull-out was worn-outour window was where people walked by and constantly smelled of weedIf you stay here, come in cool weather, plan to shower elsewhere, if you have a 5th person-bring a blow up mattress and bring your own linens.
1	Best hotel ever.. This hotel was fantastic. The hotel is clean and organized. The staff are very helpful, patient and know their jobs well. I was on my own with my son and the staff recommended top places to visit, as well giving me suggestions in saving some money too. Mary-Angeles, Joy, Patrick, Adriana, Domi, Catalina, Ashley--- Oh boy I could go on! Genuine people who treat you like you are part of a family. I will always come back here again. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and everyone. We had a wonderful time here and the memories we made are precious. There are not enough words to describe just how caring the people here at this hotel. Please take my advice and come here- you will not be disappointed.Thank youDear Leticia, Thank you for sharing your experience at the TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium.With a mission to provide superior customer service, we take great pride in serving your needs and are delighted to hear that we have met your expectations.

1	Nice bargain hotel close to attractions. Stayed several nights in June 2012. (Check several sites on the Internet for the best rates under 100 a night. Compare to the Best Western site.)The hotel is more of a motel with exterior hallways and no elevators. The room was small, but clean and adequate. The bed was comfortable, but the mini fridge was quite small. I requested a quiet room since the hotel is next to the freeway. It had a smal pool and two hot tubs. The fitness center was a room next to the pool with only a half dozen treadmills, elipticals, and a few free weights. If you want a serious workout, ask about local gyms or jog along the bay. The grounds were nicely landscaped and the place was very clean.The hotel is minutes from the mall, Old Town, and the aforementioned freeway will start you on the way to Balboa Park. The freeway near Balboa is narrow and congested at times, particularly when the zoo closes and the downtown workforce heads home. Plan on traffic issues.There are many places to eat in the area--ask at the desk. Old Town is nearby, but there are also cheaper fast food places.
1	Very Nice Hotel, Great Value. We had a very positive experience at this hotel. Our party (2 adults, 2 teenagers) had plenty of room to spread out. We had a pull-out sofa sleeper, roll-away bed, kitchenette, and queen-sz. bed. There was a large dressing area off the bathroom, a great place for suitcases, etc. The furniture was contemporary and new, beds were very comfortable. This hotel is very close to Arlington Cemetery, and the Rosslyn Metro stop was a five minute walk away. They also have a shuttle to the metro. The people at the desk were very responsive to all our needs.
0	Has gone downhill. I have stayed at this location several times and this place has gone downhill. They spent a lot to upgrade it-now they need to invest in good staff and bring back the happy hour! I was put in a handicap accessible room-so if you need those types of rooms they are well equipped!
1	Location is Everything!. We searched and searched online to find accommodation that was right on the beach (because thats where you want to be in California!), was near all the attractions we wanted to see, and would provide us with a separate bedroom and a kitchenette. Ocean Park Inn delivers on that, and more. We were in the One King Bedroom Suite, and it was everything we could have wished for - lots of living space for a 5 night stay, a kitchen to take care of our own meals (Ralphs grocery is literally across the street), a balcony with an ocean view, and a separate bedroom that was enourmous. Just off of Grand Avenue, and right on the boardwalk for Pacific Beach, you are literally steps from the sand. Beach gear was available for guest use, and we had a wonderful time sitting on the beach, swimming, boogie boarding, and walking. The pier just down the boardwalk is a wonderful spot for watching the sunset, but also makes a fantastic backdrop for an evening stroll. The pool at the Inn is on the small side, but the lounge chairs are many, and the pool is a great spot for kids to play. Breakfast was a simple continental breakfast, but had a good selection of pastries, waffles, cereal, fruit, yogurt, and hard boiled eggs. We would load up a plate and enjoy in our room, or on the balcony. The staff were so friendly and kind - we had a call after we settled in asking how our room was, and everyone was very helpful when it came to trying to fix the TV in the living room or providing a corkscrew for some California wine. Always a greeting when you entered the lobby, with a smile! On the Grand Avenue side, the Inn is flanked by restaurants. Friday through Sunday night were busy, and there was lots of music and bar noise, however, the sliding patio doors are some crazy industrial strength, and with the door closed, a lot of the noise was reduced. Running the air conditioning was enough to drown out the noise, and we had great sleeps each night. Traveling to other sites was easy, as Grand Avenue is a main road that connects to the interstate. Parking at the Inn was awesome, as parking is hard to come by in this area - parking spots are definitely on the smaller side, but there were all kinds of vehicles who managed to park safely. Smaller cars are certainly going to be easier to park in this underground lot, but you cant beat having parking on-site. The location, views, people-watching, and friendly staff make this the place to stay in San Diego!
0	Definately Needs Improvement. Check in staff did not smile or greet me. She just looked at me when I walked up to the counter. Housekeeping lady had an attitude and was rude. Did not bring washcloths, towels, or extra pillow that I requested. No one answered the phone when I called several times. There was no micro fridge or microwave as I expected and thought they stated. No iron or ironing board and they required to hold my husbands ID in order to use an iron. I will never stay at this hotel again!!!!!
1	Good place near airport not big in bells and whistles. Bells and whistles not included but the rooms are big and nice. super close to MCO you can get there in 7min or less. Suites are nice , pool in indoor and outdoor and gym is good. Lots of construction going on so maybe the bells and whistles are yet to come.The Bells and Whistles are here! We are very proud to announce that we have completed the restaurant renovation that you experienced during your visit and our brand new Sky Grille, Sky Bar and Sky Express are open for business! We are looking forward to showing you our fantastic transformation!
1	Great Location to enjoy La Jolla and SD. Estancia was recomended by a friend at UCSD. I have been to La Jolla several times but never stayed in the area. What a nice surprise, exceeding my expectations. The experence at Estancia was relaxed first class from the start. Champain with check in! I switched flights at the last minute and arrived before noon vs my 4 PM scheduled arrival. No problem. They had a deluxe king room overlooking the courtyard available. A little work for business and then meet several friends at Trinitas wine bar for tapas and drinks. Attentive service. One of the best services was Josh the shuttle driver! The hotel supplies a free shuttle to areas with in a 5 mile radius. Josh was great providing nice suggestions for places to visit in the Cove, La Jolla shores and a Saturday activity. Chris the concierge was super helpful with dinner reservations and booking activities. Great follow up on everything. While I didn't use the spa it looks fabulous and when my wife comes next time we will b e sure to try out the services.Dear boblafollette,We're so pleased that you chose to stay at Estancia. It's a delight to know that your stay at our resort exceeded your expectations! Thank you for sharing your review. We'll be sure to share your comments with the staff members you've mentioned, as they will be thrilled that you appreciated their attentive hospitality and expertise. Thank you for the excellent rating you have awarded us. We're looking forward to welcoming you back to Estancia soon, to enjoy our spa along with the rest of our deluxe amenities.
1	Best Kept Secret !. Suncoast is off the strip about 20-30 minutes depending on how you drive. Vegas is easy to get around if you do rent a car. I have stayed in several LV hotels both on and off the strip but I honestly can say I was surprised at how nice the rooms were. The views are spectacular - mountains and golf courses- very peaceful. I'm a corner checker - I hate to see dirt in the corners of the bathrooms - every square inch was spotless! The crisp snow white bed covers reassured me of the cleanliness. We felt like we had a suite by both the size and the amenities. As we kept late nights we wanted to sleep The choice of restaurants is nicely varied and even has a Seattle's Best for the coffee drinker. They bring in some great music bands. I can't say enough about the well mannered and pleasant staff. Despite the line up check in was quick and pleasant. Loved the pool hot tub with the views of the mountains. Close to great shopping (5 min walk) , 15 minute from Red Rock Canyon State Park( rock climbing, varied degrees of hiking easy to tough), 20 min to Bonnie Springs (rustic restaurant, zoo fun for all ages) I would recommend this hotel without reservation!
1	Clean, lovely pool, friendly and helpful hotel staff. My daughter and I enjoyed five nights at this hotel which was comfortable and convenient to buses to Disneyland, Universal Studios and also Outlet Mall shopping. Kelly on the front desk provided helpful suggestions for our excursions.It was very much a family-oriented hotel close to the action.There was no continental breakfast available but we were on the go so much that it didn't really matter. I would recommend this as a convenient, comfortable and clean hotel to take your family to with a lovely pool and hot tub. The fireworks from the Disneyland Park could be seen from the hotel poolside each evening.Pleased with our stay.
0	Worst Hampton Inn Experience. Please avoid this hotel. After Hampton Inn lost our reservation, Lilana was the rudest customer service employee I have encountered in a very long time. I frequently stay at Hampton Inn and was shocked at the treatment I received. The smallest amount of courtesy would have solved my problem without incident. I have never posted a review, but wanted everyone to be spared a similar experience.Thank you for your review. Please accept my sincere apologies for the poor level of service that you received this is not the Hampton norm as our goal is Satisfaction Guaranteed. I have addressed these issues with our staff, and hope that the next time you are in the area you will come stay with us again and experience an improved level of customer service. Hotel General Manager
1	Great hotel in the theater district. This is a very historic building and they have done a very nice job keeping it up to date for the needs of the modern traveler. The lobby and common areas are very inviting. The sleeping rooms however are on the small side given they were built for different times and different body sizes back in the day. We were very comfortable, the bed was great but it might get a little tight if you're a couple staying here more than one night. One interesting thing and being we wanted to sleep in on Sunday morning it was fine, is the window for our room opened on a wall about 10 ft. away and the top of the wall was covered which made for a very dark room during the morning. The one down side of staying in this part of town is that the dining options that are open later on a Saturday night are limited. We ended up eating in the 312 Restaurant which is in the hotel and it was fine but after 8pm on a Saturday night there weren't many others open in this part of town.Would definitely come back here when back in town.Thank you for providing your feedback! We are happy to see that you had an overall positive experience with us. The rooms can be on the cozy side, but we strive to make up for this with historic charm and 20's personality! If you stay with us in the future, we encourage you to request a higher room facing Randolph street so that you may enjoy a bit of a better view. We look forward to welcoming you back!
0	Most rooms lovely, this one was not good. We recently returned from our trip to Kauai. We changed islands part way through our trip and were disappointed we did. We come to Kauai for R R from stressful jobs. Our experience was very much overshadowed by our room it's location.

0	Low quality customer service and dated hotel. We were here for a family vacation during the summer. The customer service in this hotel was poor as well as the air conditioning unit was dated and did not work properly. The hallways were not air conditioned and it was hot. The bathroom tub had cracks in it.We are sorry we were not able to provide you with a better quality of service. This is not typical of our usual Hamptonality and welcoming staff, and we are always looking for ways to improve our customer experience. We'd also like to apologize for the malfunctioning air conditioner in your guest suite and have reported the issue to our maintenance team. Thank you for your feedback and we hope you will come back and stay with us again soon.
1	I always love a Hyatt Hotel. My husband and I arrived a day early for our cruise to Alaska. I tried to find a centralized hotel where everything would be within walking distance of the hotel. We were greeted outside the hotel by very friendly hotel staff. The simple expression by the hotel staff to greet me by my name is well worth my visit. The hotel room was clean and very comfortable. The bell hop made it a point to go over everything in our room, give us his name and make a quick get away. The hotel was in a perfect place to walk Pikes Place, the Space Needle and all the shopping venues around the hotel. The martini bar around the corner offered some really good Bloody Mary's and buffet breakfast. Very impressed by the hotel.
0	Stay there. You want to hear about my stay Well,,,, the first room that I was issued the heater did not work. The second room I was issued the TV did not work. At the end of the day the last thing I want to do is be shuffled around from room to room!!!!!! The cleaning crews are ether not trained correctly, or dont care. The floor in the bathroom was dirty and had long ladies hair all over. I wont be stopping there EVER again!!!! You wanted to hear about it,,,, now you have!!!! What will you do Lets see!!!
0	Great view, comfortable room, grossly understaffed. We arrived quite early so weren't surprised that we couldn't check in. We were told the room was clean but hadn't been inspected yet. We took the shuttle to Pike Place Market for a long lunch then put our 85-year-old mother in an uber to go back to the hotel. It still hadn't been inspected so she had to sit in the lobby till it was ready. We were thrilled with our view of EMP, Space Needle and Chihuly Garden. We had a 1-bedroom suite which is just a regular room with a partial wall to separate the sofa bed from the queen beds. We slept 6 fairly comfortably. Twice when we wanted to shuttle back to the hotel we couldn't get anyone at the front desk to pick up the phone. In the afternoon it took over an hour to finally get a shuttle and since it was a different driver he had a different pick-up place. We almost missed it but happened to look around the corner and half a block up then ran to catch it. After dinner when we again couldn't get through to the desk we called central reservations because they always answer the phone. They tried for 20 minutes to get through to our hotel and couldn't. They finally told us to take a taxi or an uber and we would be reimbursed. Sure enough - standard practice. When we got back to the hotel the only person at the front desk told his sad story of being SO tired and groggy because he had worked a graveyard shift the night before and was the only person at the desk for 2 hours. There was the shuttle driver sitting with nothing to do because if no one answers the phone and finds out where he needs to go he can't actually go anywhere. Very frustrating! On the plus side - breakfast was very good. This place is way overpriced though (over 400 for one night) and not the standard one expects from a Hyatt.Dear JenH,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hyatt house Seattle and thank you very much for the feedback. We will use your comments to improve our hotels operations. I am sorry that your room was not ready by the time you returned for your day out. Also to hear your experience with our front desk and shuttle staff is disheartening. The issues you experience will be addressed. Again I apologize that your stay did not go smoothly as it should have. I hope that you will give us another opportunity the next time you are in town and feel free to contact me directly so I can assist with your next stay personally. Sincerely,Jonathan
1	It is in the French Quarter.. Very nice staff. (They must have fired all the the rude people I read about in the reviews. LOL) Safe area (for New Orleans. For the people who said it was in a bad neighborhood, this is not Mayberry. ) The cost was a bit excessive in my opinion. Over 250 for one night ( although that did include parking. and it was an event weekend.) The facilities are nice. You can sit on the wrought iron balcony and watch the French Quarter wake up. The location is convenient and close to everything. The only reason this is not a 5 star review is that the shower was dirty. For that kind of money, I at least want to wash my old behind in a clean shower. The bed was VERY FIRM. It was too firm for my wife and me, but I hear some people like firm mattresses, so this would be right up your ally if you do. The second floor seems to be the best as far as views, I think. Third floor could be a beating on older folks because of the stairs. Also, there are two seperate hotels. I saw where a lady was complaining about having to walk from the office to another building. This is because she went to the wrong one, initially. There is French Quarter Suites, and New Orleans Courtyard Hotel. I think the NO Courtyard is a little higher end. Overall good experience. I will be back, but not on an event weekend.
0	Would never recommend anyone stay here. This had to be the nastiest place I've ever seen. Once you get past the tobacco spit on the walls and stairs, the Walmart shopping carts, and the dirty stinky clothes hanging on the hand rails you make it to the room. The room smelled like hundreds of cigarettes had been smoked in it and it had never been aired... More
0	No ice machine. Need update bedding Blankets. Pillows are uncomfortable Spotted babies cockroaches in kitten. No utensils. So prepare to bring things you need.
0	Unfortunate stay. We also stayed one night due to a cancelled BA flight and after also visiting another room other than the one allocated to us have decided they cannot be the same. Ours was not clean and had lots of scum around the plug hole in the bath. The shower head above it was also covered in lime scale. The carpet... More
1	modern, hip hotel. I looked around quite a bit for a decent pet-friendly hotel, and this fit the bill nicely. Everyone is very nice and friendly. The hotel itself is very comfortable and nicely appointed. If you like modern hip vibe design, this is a good place to be. It's close to restaurants and the Japanese Friends Garden, a very large park next door (though not sure why they call it Japanese since nothing about it is Japanese). I only had drinks at the bar and chose to eat across the street at the Moroccan restaurant. The bartender was very knowledgeable and friendly. The only drawback about this hotel is the lack of sound proofing. My last morning (Saturday), I was woken very early by the person in the room next door with their music blaring. Also, the music from the bar is very, very loud, and there were several people hanging outside the lobby in front of their car with their music turned up so loud it was shaking the windows. My poor dog was so scared. Also, I was gone all day the first full day there, and came back at 830pm to find my room still had not been cleaned. Minor inconvenience.Hi! Thank you for taking the time to write a review! Glad to hear you and your pup had a comfortable stay. There are actually two parks next to us, and you were most likely in Hance Park, not the Japanese Friendship Garden as there is a fee and the grounds there are built and landscaped just as they are in Japan. Perhaps on your next stay we can get you pointed in the right direction. As far as the noise issues you experienced, we are already looking in to ways we can improve this. We apologize for any inconvenience it may have caused for you and your dog. We will also address the issue with your room to see why it hadn't been cleaned while you were away.

1	Good Hotel , great bed , excelent location !. I stayed at the Rex in New Year's Eve . The room was nice, clean confortable , facing Sutter Street on the 6th floor, with a fantastic bed (see picture). I had dinner at The Rex , the food was ok although it took a while to be served. Before dinner there was live music in the hall (jazz) which was rather cool. This hotel is all about location and it's staff. The staff was amazing, friendly and made one feel very welcome. Union Square is round the corner , as well as Cable cars ( corner of Powel Sutter ). I had breakfast at Loris, it was great (check picture) . Good inexpensive food, free wireless ... can highly recommend it.I would have no problem at all to return to the Rex on my next trip to San Francisco .
1	Wasn't as bas as the reviewers described!. After reading the reviews on trip advisor before departing, I headed straight to my travel agent to enquire about a transfer to a different hotel, but was persueded to give it a try. So armed with my bleach wipes and can of oust we arrived at the hotel. However, I need not have worried, as I was not greeted by a musty smell at reception, not rude staff. I entered our room apprehensively, and although it was very dated and basic, it was perfect for our familys needs. Cleanish, with a fridge and tv, room service everyday, and friendly, helpfull staff.The free breakfast was ok for a few days of the holiday, but there are only so many meals you can eat off of a polystyrene plate lol. The best thing about the hotel was it's fantastic location. Situated right behing a KFC, and Walgreens 24hr supermarket and right in the middle of International drive, we couldn't have asked for better. Universal is around a 15 minute walk from the hotel, but it's a lovely walk with beautiful gardens and little lakes on the way there. You are also only 2 minutes away from Wet Wild and a whole load of shops and restaurants.The transport links here are fantastic all the way up down I drive, and the stops are seconds away from the hotel. The free shuttle bus can be very busy, escpecially in the morning and on the 8pm and 10pm return buses from Disney. If you're only off to Aquatica for example, you are better hopping on the I trolley as it only costs 1.25 and your almost always guaranteed a seat.The pool at the hotel is open until 11pm, and its heated, so a welcome relief to your sore feet after a hard day at the parks or shopping.All in all, I would possibly stay here again. It is basic, but from the other reviews I have read, it is no more run down than the more expensive alternatives.
1	Perfect Location!. We loved Hotel Zephyr! It's a very unique hotel right in Fisherman's Wharf. I appreciated the email they sent before our arrival asking us if we had any special requests - Was this a special occasion Extra towels or pillows needed etc. By posting our booking with them on Facebook, we were given a voucher for a free upgrade upon availability. Corinne and Bernadette were wonderful at the front desk, they not only honored our upgrade and gave us a balcony room facing the Bay, but kept us on the same floor with our friends we were traveling with. When we arrived to our room, there was a welcome note from the staff wishing us an enjoyable first time to San Francisco. We enjoyed the ambience of the outdoor area every night and even played some of the games provided. We were very happy with the housekeeping, concierge and all the staff, plus we loved the great location. We highly recommend Hotel Zephyr!The Z team is always here to make you feel at home, Kim C! We are all about creating memories for our guests and loved having you with us for your first time to our great city. Can't wait to do it all over again! Until next time...Cheers, James
